It's still extensive and so tasty. The guacamole is, of course as good as it has always been in charritos! Made fresh, table side with degree of spice to your preference. The burrito with vegetarian picadillo was filling and tasteful with a side of rice and beans. No complaints, rather much curiosity and delight from the person who ordered it. (How can I replicate this at home? What veggies are in here?) I ordered the gorditas...think open pupusas kind sandwiches. Corn torta stuffed with beans and other deliciousness. Two in an order. Delightful. And the molotes...stuffed maduros (sweet plantains) so delish.  Yum yum yum. Nothing disappointed in fact it was all so guiltless and flavorful and the service was the perfect combo of respecting your space and keeping you hydrated. Nicely done.

Guacamole wasn't as spicy as I requested (5th st guac, former uptown location) still has the best guacamole hands down. This guacamole doesn't taste the same. Food seemed dry and bland. If you are following a vegetarian, vegan, low sodium and BLAND flavor diet then this is the place to go. Everything just tasted dry to me. Place is TINY, hard to get in and out of your table without knocking someone else's table.Not sure if I'll be returning to this place again.

2,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,3.0 star rating,"It truly pains me to write this review of Charrito's downtown location but I feel like I must. Since I wrote the original review I've been to this location several times and enjoyed it immensely. However, the current incarnation of the restaurant, which displays the word ""Vegetarian"" on its front window, leaves a lot to be desired. What remains true to its original form is the gorgeous painted walls (mural like) which seem inviting and that the small size of the restaurant creates a welcomed intimacy. Charritos' brand name has gone through a lot of changes in the past several months. They first opened a midtown location, which had a different menu than the downtown and (now closed) uptown location, while the downtown location was going through renovations. Once my beloved uptown location closed I was waiting in anticipation for the downtown location to open as the only non-meat item on the midtown location's menu is their staple table-made guacamole. I was even more excited to find out that the downtown location had a vegetarian menu and had one of my favorite dishes (Chiles Rellenos). I've managed to convince my carnivore fiance to come here about a week ago for an early dinner. He got there before me and got a table as the restaurant was pretty much empty. Once I got there he told me that he saw at least one couple leave after being told it's vegetarian only.While the restaurant was pretty empty once I came in, besides one party, it has filled up in the time we were there (each party coming in was told the same thing about the vegetarian menu). We started with the table-made guacamole and while it was just as good as in other locations, we both noticed the size of it was much smaller than usual. I later realized they only used one avocado, as opposed to their regular two, yet charged the same amount for it. I am not sure if there was some kind of shortage but either way, that was really disappointing.As for the Chiles Rellenos themselves, my favorite part about the dish is the oaxaca cheese they are filled with. What I didn't realize until ordering is that this restaurant isn't actually vegetarian but it's actually vegan. Perhaps the owners and workers do not know the difference but it's a significant one. The poblano pepper instead was stuffed with a cashew based sauce. It was not bad but it was far from the flavor of their original Chiles Rellenos. My fiance ordered the Fajitas (Sautéed peppers, onions, tomatoes and squash. Served with rice, beans and almond cream) and found it to be just ok, he ordered a size of cheese but it was vegan cheese and far from the best I've ever tasted.I am honestly not sure if I will be back.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
3,a0f1WawCbZmmupTjSd099g,Jadira Q.,3.0 star rating,"Before I start this review, I think its important to note there is 2 Charrito's in Hoboken.  The one on 121 Washington is VEGETARIAN while the one on 518 is not! lolI say this only because we were all in the mood for steak and we had  no idea there were two Charrito's in Hoboken.  We went to the one in 518 first but quickly discovered our friends were not there so no biggie! We walked down to the one on 121.  This is when we quickly discovered there were no meat options here!But nonetheless we sat and really took in how pretty and intimate this location was.  The walls are beautifully painted and the seats against the wall are lined with delicate pillows...and the plates! The cutest little things I have seen! Everything about this place is carefully thought out which I can really appreciate it.Because it was BYOB, we asked the waiter that was dressed in typical Mexican attire to make us a Margarita pitcher with the Tequila we brought.  They don't offer any flavors for the Margarita but the regular one tasted just fine to us. Maybe because he used half the bottle but it was still pretty good! lolFor food, we decided to order the Guacamole, the Tamales and the Molotes which were pan fried plantain that is stuffed with cheese, tomato sauce and queso fresco topped with pickled onions.  All were pretty good and apparently the tamales were spicy.  Perhaps maybe because I have a high tolerance for spice but I didn't think it was that bad but it did take over your entire palette so everyone decided to taste since the poor guy was breaking out in a sweat!! Good times! lolThe Guacamole was also really good and made to order tableside.  I think everyone there had ordered it and you can decide the level of spice to it. We were really tempted to order the Nopales, which is the grilled cactus but none of us pulled the trigger to try it!  Perhaps I will try during my next visit because the presentation of the Guacamole was pretty adorable and I can see this place being a cute spot to catch up with one of my friends :)",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Yesterday, a friend and I were planning to have dinner at the midtown location, thinking the downtown location was still closed. We were pleasantly surprised when we discovered that the downtown location has reopened and now the menu is fully vegan, with the exception of two items which are vegetarian. We ordered the elotes, enchiladas rojas, alambres, and the chips & salsa. Everything was just as delicious as before and we could not even taste the difference between vegan cheese and dairy cheese on the elotes. The chips were accompanied by two sauces, one which was a roasted tomato salsa and another was a which was the consistency of a well-blended green smoothie, both were absolutely delicious. The enchiladas were filled with sautéed greens and topped with a spicy red sauce.

We started by bringing a bottle of Tequila purchased from across the street at Sparro Liquors (how perfect). We ordered a pitcher of margaritas which were very strong. I only hope the servers used the entire bottle of Tequila, because we did not get it back! The food was Amazing and so so filling. We ordered the Quesorito (Queso + vegan chorizo + Mushrooms) served with corn tortillas and salad, as well as the fried plantains stuffed with vegan cream cheese. Luckily, we did not order anything else because these two dishes alone were huge and extremely satisfying. 9 out of 10, I would hands down go back again! The location is small, but intimate, and we were the first ones there and within one hour every table was packed. Hoboken needs more vegan and vegetarian places.

15,QmXD8PoMBe5WHX0diF2g0g,Shonnie H.,3.0 star rating,"It's a hole in the wall restaurant with a few indoor and outdoor seating. The A/C was very temperamental - on and off every 10 mins or so, and on a 90+ degree day with barely any breeze, it's NOT okay. I'm not sure if it's their A/C setting or if they're turning it on/off every so often, but STAPH IT. We came in and were greeted by very nonchalant staff. We chose our seat and put bottles of wine on the table - a lady came by and asked if we needed glasses for the wine. WELL, let me think about that. Has anyone ever said ""don't bring me glasses, Ima drink straight from the bottle?"" Odd question. There weren't many customers - in fact, we were the only ones sitting inside. So the swiftness of service isn't surprising. We ordered our food. The pollo en rajas was decent. The rice and beans were cooked well, but nothing to sing about. The shredded beef burrito was apparently good, but we ended up taking half of each plate home. We also were only given one glass of water - 'twas a bit bizarre, and what would've happened if I wasn't the sharebear carebear?Anyway, it's as authentic as it gets for Mexican food in this particularly area, so I might make another visit - but definitely never to come during hot summer days.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

We came for lunch and shared the mushroom queso and then I ordered carne asada. There are complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were average (they could've used some salt) and I couldn't eat the salsa because cilantro. The queso was DELISH. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the cheese was melty & delicious, and the many tortillas were warm. Also, The tortilla basket was adorable-- a little sombrero. I'm easily amused but I loved that little touch! Giving this three stars because the carne asada was SO dry & bland & rubbery. After a delicious queso, I was hoping for a yummy taco but was so not into these. I ordered sour cream to supplement the dryness, and that was yummy, but I definitely wouldn't order the tacos again.

There is not one, not two, but three locations in Hoboken alone.  All on the *same street*.  Which suggest it's doing well, and I'm all for a local guy succeeding.  But see point 3. 2.  It's expensive for what you're getting.  Mexican food can be labor intensive -I get that- but come on.  But it's really not real Mexican cusine.  See point 3.3.  The vast majority of the menu is American food, coupled with a vein or two of relative authenticity.  Which, sadly, reflects Hoboken's bro demo. and unsophisticated pallet.  4.  The sheep line up for this place.  Which, well, see point 3.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
35,QmXD8PoMBe5WHX0diF2g0g,Shonnie H.,3.0 star rating,"It's a hole in the wall restaurant with a few indoor and outdoor seating. The A/C was very temperamental - on and off every 10 mins or so, and on a 90+ degree day with barely any breeze, it's NOT okay. I'm not sure if it's their A/C setting or if they're turning it on/off every so often, but STAPH IT. We came in and were greeted by very nonchalant staff. We chose our seat and put bottles of wine on the table - a lady came by and asked if we needed glasses for the wine. WELL, let me think about that. Has anyone ever said ""don't bring me glasses, Ima drink straight from the bottle?"" Odd question. There weren't many customers - in fact, we were the only ones sitting inside. So the swiftness of service isn't surprising. We ordered our food. The pollo en rajas was decent. The rice and beans were cooked well, but nothing to sing about. The shredded beef burrito was apparently good, but we ended up taking half of each plate home. We also were only given one glass of water - 'twas a bit bizarre, and what would've happened if I wasn't the sharebear carebear?Anyway, it's as authentic as it gets for Mexican food in this particularly area, so I might make another visit - but definitely never to come during hot summer days.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

We came for lunch and shared the mushroom queso and then I ordered carne asada. There are complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were average (they could've used some salt) and I couldn't eat the salsa because cilantro. The queso was DELISH. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the cheese was melty & delicious, and the many tortillas were warm. Also, The tortilla basket was adorable-- a little sombrero. I'm easily amused but I loved that little touch! Giving this three stars because the carne asada was SO dry & bland & rubbery. After a delicious queso, I was hoping for a yummy taco but was so not into these. I ordered sour cream to supplement the dryness, and that was yummy, but I definitely wouldn't order the tacos again. Cute place (fun, intimate Mexican vibe), but definitely would never order the tacos again.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Super colorful decorations and walls painted with Mexican scenes and Prince Royce playing in the background. There's a kind of comfort in coming to these establishments, because you have kind of have a general idea of what you're going to be getting.Start off with chips and salsa. The chips weren't warm but that's fine. Salsa was okay, could have had a little more flavor. I got chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, rice and beans on the side. The enchiladas were good, but the mole sauce tasted a bit burnt. I'm not sure if it was or if that was the taste because I've only had mole sauce a handful of times, but those times it was a bit sweeter without the burnt aftertaste. It was still good though. They use black beans for their side, which I prefer to that salty pinto bean paste stuff. The service was friendly and attentive. Our waiter filled up our waiters right away and was patient when we were taking a while to order. We also stayed for a while and weren't rushed out.I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for Mexican (but not expecting anything out of this world).

So going in to this restaurant, I was already prepared to have great Mexican food. This restaurant is much smaller than other Charrito's and can feel a bit cramped. There is no hostess table and no dish cleanup station. It has the feel of a dining room that can seat maybe 20 people, more or less. We didn't have this problem, but it can be inconvenient to sit near the door during colder weather as the door doesn't shut close on it's own; while I was there a diner at a different table had to keep shutting the door.We went on a Saturday for lunch around 1:30PM. It wasn't too busy and we were easily seated. There was one waiter the entire time we were there. He appeared to maneuver waiting on all the tables well. We never had a problem with him checking in on us or us grabbing his attention.We both started with the guacamole. The guacamole here is one of my favorites! They serve in a large mortar and pestle and make it at the table. The waiter made sure to ask what spice level we wanted and adapted accordingly. It complemented the free corn chips and salsa well. My husband ordered the Carne Asada tacos, while I had the their chorizo and scrambled eggs dish off of their huevos section. The Carne Asada tacos were solid. The chorizo and scrambled eggs was great, particularly with their homemade hot sauce (a spicy green sauce).I like this place! I may even prefer the smaller atmosphere here.

Pretty much just a soft corn taco with meat and some raw chopped onion and cilantro. Although it's on the pricey side they are giving you a good amount of meat for sure.

Just Avo and cilantro and they add jalapeño if you want it hot. But it tastes like its missing something 2- chicken fajitas- great sautéed pepper and onion full in flavor and tender chicken also rich in flavor. Very small portion of rice and beans. Not the best rice it was almost mush. And I'm not the biggest fan of Refried beans so I wouldn't be the best person to give advice about it 3- steak- very thin portion the meat was good but the portion was extremely small 4- 2 salads- very basic the string beans were from a can.

We've placed probably 5 or 6 delivery orders and the same lady has delivered every time. Every single time that she's come to our door, she starts breathing extremely heavily in an exaggerated and dramatic way. Keep in mind that my 90 year old grandmother has zero issue walking up these stairs, along with countless other delivery guys/girls. This lady has even called me to come downstairs to get the food and makes comments about the stairs. She makes us feel very uncomfortable and guilty, so unfortunately Charrito's has lost our business because of this. I do admit the food is very good, though.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Technically, it is on the appetizers page, towards the bottom, but the Large for $13 comes with 4 chicken flautas, rice, and beans! What a steal! So filling that I couldn't even finish!So why minus two stars? Service. First, they accidentally gave away our table, no big deal. Then we sat for 20 minutes with nobody acknowledging us. We flagged someone down to ask for sangria, guac, and chips (all tables are given chips and salsa to start...all tables except ours). They brought the guac and forgot the other two. I had to ask for our guac, chips, and salsa another two times. Finally had to flag someone to take our order, but then the food came our very quickly.

I do love your guac and not because it's made table side, but because it really is damn good. I love that you ask me how hot I want it and you comply with my demand for heat. Your tomato sauce-like salsa made me stop eating chips and salsa, which I thank you for, because anywhere else I'll inhale the bowl while slurping the salsa down like soup at a Chinese restaurant. Never a good look, or so at least my hubs tells me. My shrimp smothered in mole sauce was good, very unique and a great flavor, rich with the cocoa and chile creamy sauce, but for the $20 +/-, it wasn't worth it. I know this is Hoboken, but your restaurant is the size of one of LeBron's shoes.Looking for a BYOB marg and some cheap tacos in downtown Hoboken, I'd say give it a try.

87,5Scml16oOZXoA_54aYeyTA,Jessica S.,3.0 star rating,"Look, I'm a native Californian.  I'm super-snobby about my mexican food.  I have standards.  Most of the places here on the East Coast are questionable at best.  However, sometimes you get a craving and NEED to have it, no matter the quality.  My husband and I have been going to Charrito's for years.  It's small (for now, till they move to their new location), festive, and has decent basic Mexican food.  When in doubt, keep it simple and you can't go wrong here.  Tacos are decent, and the table side guacamole is always delicious (albeit, small on the portion-side).  The other night, we went back and tried something different - Chilaquiles.  I've had Chilaquiles many other places and this one was ok.  The flavor was fantastic.  Salsa verde, queso fresco and crema.  All of it fresh and spot-on.  The carne asada was cooked perfectly, but not really seasoned, so it didn't add or subtract anything from the dish.  My biggest issue with the whole thing was that the chips were kind of soggy.  The sauce ended up being too much of a good thing.  Made the texture a little funky.  But, a good effort.  I think I'll stick to the tacos there when we go back.Guacamole was terrific, chips were fresh, salsa yummy.  And, as always, BYO wine for their sangria.  It is still just as good as always!  As far as East Coast Mexican food goes, I've had better, but I am always happy to come back here because over the last 9 years it's been consistent and a nice go-to!  Plus, the atmosphere is lovely there and that's always a good thing!",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

I asked for no fresh cheese on top of my enchiladas because it makes my stomach upset but they forgot and put it on anyways.

97,FywqgVqYquyaqhtLxVwbkQ,Chelsea B.,4.0 star rating,"My friend from Florida was visiting and she was craving Mexican. I recently moved into a new apartment and I haven't discovered any Mexican restaurants in the area yet. As Yelp had been good to us the night before when we were looking for places in the city to go out, we both began scanning the site for some places nearby. We bought a bottle of wine and took the train to Hoboken after we had decided on Charrito's. We were starrrrvvvinnnggg by this point, as we had been out all night and pretty much zombied through the day without much food. I was nervous we wouldn't get a table, but we got lucky with the last 2 seater left outside (the place is REALLY small). My friend is not a fan of avocados, but she sucked it up so we could try the guac app. They make it right in front of you and let you decide how spicy you want to make it. We went for Medium, as my sensitive friend, leaning towards Mild, sucked it up for me yet again - omg I am such a bad hostess. We also both enjoyed our entrees (the mole sauce was spicy!). We were at Charrito's for about 2 1/2 hours. By the end I had about a gallon of Sangria in my stomach and about a pound of Mexican food. I can't believe we went out again afterwards. I could hardly move. The only downside to sitting outside was that the air conditioners from the apartments above kept dripping on us. It was slightly annoying, but by the end of the giant pitcher of sangria we didn't care.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

We had already gotten our bill but sat for a little bit to finish our drinks...about 5 minutes later our waiter came over and asked us to finish our drinks at the counter (which wasn't even a real bar) so they could clear our table.

It wasn't bad but not breathtaking or memorable. Egg was a bit overdone and the chorizo was bland, compared to other Mexican style chorizo I've had. What was memorable was that I couldn't get a side of guacamole or even a few slices on avocado with my brunch. The waiter was kind and checked with the kitchen. He said ""they"" said no because it's not dinner. I pointed out that the guacamole is on the brunch menu, but it's not ""a side"". Sliced avocado is a few cuts of the knife, charge me extta, whatever. But there we were 1 or 2 tables.

I'm not sure if they marinated it with beer and acid as is traditionally done, but it didn't have too much flavor. The stars of the dish were clearly the refried beans and guacamole. The refried beans were unique in that the were puréed quite fine and served with queso fresco on top. Delicious!!!I was taught to make guac by starting with pico de gallo, then adding avocados. I don't think there were any tomatoes, but a very good guacamole nonetheless. All in all, service was acceptable. Location and ambiance were nice.

The experience was so terrible I'd be doing others a disservice by not sharing it. Our party of four arrived on a Friday night and it was packed, understandably. I was told a table was leaving and they just had to get it cleaned. No problem, we went across the street and bought a bottle of tequila, beer and white wine. We came back and I was told the hostess had made a mistake and didn't realize there was another party ahead of us. Annoying, but not a big deal, so we went down the block to have a drink. When we came back it took the hostess a long time to set the new table. We asked if we could sit down and she gave an attitude and said she couldn't set table with us seated. After she went to the back and disappeared we decided to sit down anyway. After a few minutes she came over, gave us menus, and said a server would be over who ""might take our order."" The food came out slowly and it took a while to get our margaritas made. At one point the hostess spilled a beer on my friend and gave a very robotic (or stoned?) ""I'm sorry."" At this point we were starting to get irritated and I said the dress would need to get dry cleaned. She really didn't seem to care. I asked to speak to a manager, and she said there wasn't one around. I asked for the number to have before we left and I could tell she was annoyed with me. After waiting much longer for the check then we should have I went over to the back (where two servers and the hostess were just standing around) and asked again for the check and the bottle of wine we didn't drink. It took them a few minutes to find the wine and when they did they HANDED ME AN EMPTY BOTTLE. They were NOT sorry they had used our bottle on other customers. At this point I was furious and asked for something to be comped on our check. When they refused, I then said the whole check should be comped for what terrible service we received. They seemed to be angry at this and began to argue with me. My fiancé came over to help and one of the servers started to make fun of me like he was a 10 year old. My fiancé was able to get 2 entrees comped.This was the complete opposite of customer service, example after example of what NOT to do.

My meal came, the flank steak was seasoned and covered in fresh queso, the beans, pico de gallo and rice were all there, but I never even got so much as a niblet of tri-color cactus salad!

I'd rather go to Chipotle down a few blocks for a filling bowl, or indulge on amazing fried avocado tacos around the corner from The Taco Truck.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
126,0ZfBL93vKALyH_FG_eNHuw,Daniel T.,4.0 star rating,"A very good Mexican restaurant in hoboken. Very good location right on Washington Street. Very good quality food along with good portions. For a starter me and my girlfriend got guacamole and chips. They made the guacamole right in front of you and gave unlimited chips to go with it. The guacamole was very good a great starter.For a main dish I got enchiladas, which were very good and solid portions. My girlfriend got Carne asada which was OK but the meat was a little tough, although she loved the side dishes.  The atmosphere was OK we ate outdoors so seating was understandably limited, the indoor area looked like it was a bit bigger. The service was good and it was byob which is always nice.The value was also decent for hoboken. The bill before tip was just under 40$ no desert. I would give this place a 4.5 my only complaint was the Carne asada but it wasn't bad at all just the one thing that keeps it from a 5 star.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Ordered taquitos for an app and it was the perfect amount of cheese and guacamole on them. Very delicious. Entree was Pollo de Rajas and seriously the cream sauce had a slight kick but was so flavorful I couldn't stop eating. The corn was sweet so it offset the spice and the chicken was thin and cooked to perfrction. BYOB though or run to the liquor store across the street.

A bit on the expensive side, but it's also pretty authentic. Table-side guacamole is a must!!! So good, and definitely worth the money as a starter. I had enchiladas, so I can only attest to those being really, really good. But everything I saw looked tasty!The place is kind of small, though, so it might be a problem if you have a stroller or a large group. Also, like many places in Hoboken, it's BYOB.

It's obvious the restaurant cares about the guests' dining experience.My only gripe was that service was remarkably slow for a place that has five people waiting on just ten tables.  You'd think things would be really prompt and attentive, but we actually waited quite long for food, to have dishes cleared and for the check.  Service was only okay but everything else was great.  I'll definitely be back.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

In the future, I will likely stick with guacamole and a few appetizers or one entree to share...Any more is just too much.

I am not usually a fan of guacamole, since it's usually just taken out from a container and tastes weird to me...but here, they will make it to order for you. as in, they come out and start mashing up the ingredients right in front of you to suit your tastes. want more lime? more onion? more chili? they'll do it for you.for the actual dinner, I had the shredded chicken enchilada suizas. came with rice, beans, pico de gallo, and your choice of salsa (of course I went for salsa verde, gotta keep it spicy). thems was delicious, indeed, and the portion was great - not overwhelming, but definitely filling. total bill was 50 bucks. reasonable, I'd say.yes, there are lines...get here early and avoid that, so you don't look like a chump.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

It's that good, and you can choose just how you want it prepared. The menu, itself, is quite extensive, and everything looks so good (and IS good), that it's hard to choose right away.

I will admit that the prices I saw on the menu were higher than I was anticipating. However, once I tasted it and saw the portions I don't this they are unreasonable. We got the fresh guac - large bowl handmade at the table and very good. Then we each got enchiladas as entrees (one chicken, one beef).

Sidenote: I don't know what it is about food that's made tableside, but it always tastes better than when it's made in the kitchen. Anyway, this guacamole was very creamy and delicious. The only drawback was that we asked for medium heat and got a very tame, mild serving. For our entrees, we got the Enchiladas Nortenas, which I can safely say were some of the best enchiladas I've ever had. They weren't drowning in sauce like at some other Mexican restaurants (looking at you, On The Border), yet were still very flavorful and filling.

It was bad enough that it made me wonder if someone skipped a shift or perhaps, this is a norm? We only ordered the guac since we were snacking on break. Aside from the delay, the guac itself was not as impressive as people make it out to be.

NOT EVEN ONE MINUTE LATER, she is making us guacamole next to the table! fine, we let that slide. they kept coming over and over and over and over, we could barely carry on a conversation they kept coming over and asking if we were ready to order. again, we said we hadn't looked at the menu yet and mind you - we had barely TOUCHED the guac yet! fine, they leave us alone. we start eating the guac, and the guy brings us our check and says thanks for coming. excuse me?! first of all, we have a full pot of guacamole, second of all, we have a giant pitcher of sangria to finish. we never said we weren't eating, we just said we wanted to take our time! there was one other table in there at that point! big WTF moment for me. moving on to the food... we shared the charros special - fajitas with steak, chicken, and shrimp. HARD PASS on this. the shrimp was inedible and disgustingly fishy. the steak was the best protein in there and it still wasn't even as good as fajita steak should be. the chicken was like rubber. so gross. the best part was the rice that came on the side plate with the refried beans. rice should never be the best part of the meal! i love rice and everything that rice is about but come on - unless you're ordering a rice dish it should never be the star of the show. i'll never come back here again, that's a fact. this is not the place to go for a nice meal, it's not the place to go if you're catching up with a friend, it's not the place to go if you're looking for decent mexican food. i honestly believe that once taco bell starts serving alcohol [i heard this rumor somewhere] that it will be a better option for eating out than charritos ever will be. there's just so much better out there. sorry charritos - you're f***ing out!",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

I could get past how small the downtown location is if the food was up to par. Forgive me for dropping my ethnic in but I just felt it was a bit ""American"" for Mexican food. It lacked real taste and flavor that I was looking for. Everything was bland. The table side guac is always a good show but beyond that I wasn't impressed with this spot.

Went with a few friends last night and could not even find the hostess, finally after asking a waiter they just laughed and said it'd be about an hour or two wait and I could not get a reservation. Went back today and all hell insinuated. My friends and I were sat outside and given menus. After we were there for 10 minutes another couple was sat next to us and were given their menus and within a minute had a waitress asking their orders. I finally flagged down a waitress and had the RUDEST service. I said we had been waiting for a while and would like to order and she said, ""oh, well yeah guess I can take it."" One of my friends didn't want to order and brought a snack to eat. A man working there saw her eating and spoke in Spanish to our waitress, I speak Spanish and it translated to ""why is this B*tch eating that here?"" I turned to him and asked why she couldn't and then she nice enough to put her food away to wait while we ate. Then the waitress came back out and said she wasn't allowed to sit with us unless she ordered something. We got up to leave because by this point we had had far enough, but I wanted to speak to the manager. I asked the girl who the manager was and she laughed and said the manager was at the other location. I then asked for the next person in charge and it was the waiter behind me. I tried to tell him what happened and he also laughed and then called us rude for bringing other food in there and continued to blame the entire ordeal on us. We left. Disgusted.

So, when the other night we went there, at first we were quite pleased that there wasn't the signature huge line outside. Even more excited to see a corner table open, mind it that's a table for four, this detail is of utmost importance. We stepped in, no host, ok - i can take that. After around 5 minutes someone turns up, takes our name phone number and we are told to wait 25-30 minutes. That's fine with me too. So as we stand there, my husband and I think its quiet here with not a lot of waiters and a table open, so what's the waiting for?! Also, they never did this number thing earlier. If you're on the list, and you are in sight, you get the seat. Well, that's ok, that can change. I went in, waved to get attention of their main guy, and asked him if they have started taking reservations. He says - No. So an obvious follow up question was - who are you saving that table for, coz I see no one waiting?! He says - you don't need to wait here, wait anywhere you like and we ll give you a call when table is ready. That was ok, we live a couple of blocks away and decided to wait in our building to avoid standing in subzero temperatures outside. After 25 minutes pass, we walk to charrito's again, and still see that table open, but no one called yet. My husband was bound to satiate his curiosity now, and asked the other girl- why won't you just give us that seat?! Fair question! She said - that's a table for four, we can't give it to party of two. He had to ask and did- but there's no one here waiting or came for that table in past half hour. And she said the easy word, sorry. At the end of a total 40 minutes of wait for a table that open already, we told her that you are pretty much driving customers out with this policy. Why won't you take our money and let us enjoy rather than wait endlessly for a party of FOUR! We walked to the place in uptown now, and discussed the disgruntled gentleman who left charrito's right at the time we stepped in, the dots joined perfectly now!20 minutes later, i get a call from the downtown charrito's to ask if i am still waiting for my table, i asked- do you think i would be!?

No big deal though until it took another 2x to ask. Its like we were blantantly ignored.

The food comes and obviously there was no check back, thank god we didnt need anything because clearly we wouldnt have recieved it. We finish and wait and wait and wait. I mean honestly at this point we could have walked out and they still wouldnt have noticed. I literally had to walk into the kitchen and ask for my check only to recieve it and wait another 20 mins for them to take my card.

And you also adjust the taste of each drink in larger parties.)Since I've been several times, I would recommend: 1) Grilled shrimp was ever so tasty and grilled perfectly!  3) Fresh guac is also made at the table.  3) Garlic camarones, I think this is an appetizer or a light entree.

We were waiting for a while, snacking on chips and salsa, which were delicious. The chips were so fresh. They did a poor job of checking up on us and bringing more though. Finally, they brought out food, but only 3 of us got our food. The other 2 orders were just somehow completely forgotten or something.

213,CaMkCi3avcD2UTtQoERIGw,Tony C.,4.0 star rating,"I avoided all Mexican places like the plague when first moving here, but for good reason. 1) C'mon, this is Hoboken, land of the Irish sports bars, pizzerias, and the Cake Boss. 2) I moved here from the Bay Area where mind-blowing burritos grow on trees. What I can tell you is that by avoiding Charrito's for a year, all I did was rob myself of solid Mexican food. The burrito there is just as good as the ones I've had from the Bay Area. The service is super friendly. And, the fact you can bring your own tequila for margaritas is just over the top. The only negative is the size of this place. Depending on when I go, there's either no one in there, or there's an hour wait. (I've never been to the Charrito's uptown. Maybe they have more room there.)",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Nachos con Carne - definitely the best I've had in a long time. We ordered it with steak and it came covered in cheese, refried beans, steak that had clearly been cooked and then chopped into little pieces, drizzled with sour cream, a good dollop of guacamole, and some of the awesome mexican queso (the white stuff that looks like bits of styrofoam) that I love eating. Good proportion of topping - the chips didn't get too soggy and still retained crunch down to the last bite. We asked for more chips and they didn't fuss about giving us another basket. Scraped the plate yum.Ricos Burritos - the hubby ordered his with shredded beef; you can get it with grilled chicken, shredded or ground beef, or steak (for add'l cost). Stuffed with rice, beans, and cheese, it looked very tasty... husband had to manually remove green bell peppers that were mixed into it (he's a picky man) but I thought it was very good. they serve it with guac, refried beans, rice, and sour cream on the side.Tacote Norteno - my dish... flavorful. I ordered mine with sauteed chicken, cheese and mixed vegetables. The veggies were NOT soggy, everything was cooked perfectly, and i definitely had enough for lunch the next day. Same sides as my husband... and the guac is definitely a treat here, i'd want an order of it to eat next time... but the nachos are so good... decisions decisions...Service: it was a bit slow, but it was also Memorial Day, and there were people packing this tiny establishment. We noticed the BYOB going on at other tables - they really do make you sangria as long as you bring the wine, so I think we're going to try it next time!Decor: chintzy. I definitely appreciated the random colorful butterflies and flowers decorating the place. The fresco'ed walls were cute. My husband was super cramped...

Yes, the guacamole is made right in front of you - to show that they only use fresh avocados, and none of their guacamole appetizer is ever fridged overnight. It's not like cheap ($10) but definitely worth it. Some say the guacamole is missing 'something' to it(like missing a 'kick') - most likely it's the lack of tomatoes and/or yogurt mix that is added to many other kinds of guacamole. It's very fresh, but kind of plain.  You get to pick if mild, medium, or spicy.Had the pollo burrito and it was a PLEASURE. Doesn't look too big, but added with a small side of beans and rice(on same plate) it was very fulling. The pollo was marinated to perfection, and there was much 'sizzle' to the dish. It was made very fresh, and the wrap skin was tender and thin. A must try. The complimentary nachos were mediocre and the salsa satisfying enough.

Bring tequila and they will make you a pitcher of margaritas, bring wine and they will make you a pitcher of Sangria. I believe each pitcher will cost $9. The only downside here was that once we were seated, no one came to take our order for 15-20 minutes until we asked the hostess for help.

We started with the guac, prepared live, jalapeños added to your spiciness preference. Lots of cilantro, really yummy. I had a shredded beef burrito, which was really delicious.

261,zpkVa7wbmVlWXRVL13pYzA,Tyler I.,5.0 star rating,"Wow this is great Mexican food and a great ambiance. When I saw the positive reviews, I was skeptical. Sometimes you see great reviews for Mexican restaurants that people call authentic. Then you find out the food is low-quality, fried, smushed-together, canned stuff and the atmosphere is a rickety table and a tv. I prefer Mexican more in line with Qdoba and Chipotle, that is (seemingly) fresh and less processed ingredients.  This is somewhere in between the two varieties and better than both. The ingredients definitely seem fresh. The salsa they give you with the recently baked tortilla chips is light and spicy with fresh cilantro and onions. I ordered some vegetarian dish, cant remember the name, but it came with stir-fried broccoli and fresh avocado slices! Right on! Don't get me wrong, you'll find re-fried beans, big helpings, and lots of cheese -- but it's in good taste. Everything is full of flavor and fresh. Sometimes when I order something like a burrito from a traditional Mexican place it just has rice and beans in a tortilla and then some cheese on it. Where are all the ingredients, I ask myself. At Charrito's, it turns out!     Also, decor is great: big murals on the walls, cute space, cushions on the seats, nice menus, cool napkins, paper cut outs hanging from the ceiling. Looks fun, not tacky. Prices are a little higher than typical Mexican. Basic entrees 12-14. Special entrees 16-20.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

NOT ONCE DID I GET AN APOLOGY!!!!!Not only did i wait AN HOUR AND A HALF, but the service in the actual restaurant was ridiculous. After myself and two friends had been waiting for 45 minutes (the estimated wait time that was given to us) and went inside to find that the waiter didn't even put us on the list. When we complained that we were waiting for 45 minutes already he then tried to put us at the BOTTOM OF THE LIST. Um, absolutely NOT!He told us that the next available table would be ours, but then continued to seat other people who hadn't been waiting as long as us. After we were finished boiling over about the wait, he then continued to blame the people in the restaurant for making us wait, as if it was THEIR fault that he didn't put us on the list. We finally sit, THANK GOD! Because I've been to Charrito's before and couldn't stop talking about how GREAT the food is, since my friends had never been there before. We had to request chips and salsa and wait like 10 minutes to get them. (mind you, we're really hungry because we waited 45 minutes longer than we expected to get a table). My frustration was just boiling up. I wanted to order the sangria (BYOB), but i was so angry that i didn't have the patience to wait for it so we just started drinking the wine to chill out.We then ordered our food and it came REALLY fast (sweet). It looked amazing and delicious and it smelled heavenly. My FIRST BITE INTO THE FOOD there was a ROCK in it... YES! I KID YOU NOT! A F**king ROCK!@#!$!@#% WHAT?!?!?! Are you kidding? I then had to sit there for 15 minutes before the waiter was in sight to come to our table. I then handed him the ROCK that i BIT! and told him it was in my food and i told him to take my plate off of the table and that i didn't want that food. HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, except ""Want me to get you something else?"" Um, WHAT!?!? I told him i absolutely did not want ANYTHING ELSE because there was a ROCK IN MY FOOD! Still no apology... Then he disappeared from the table and room for a solid 20 minutes and completely ignored our table when he came back out from the back. My friend's food was fine. No Rocks, everyone's teeth were left in tact after the meal. Needless to say I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER go back to Charrito's, which sucks because their food is delicious (sans rocks). The service is absolutely HORRENDOUS!!! Not only did we not get an apology for waiting so long, but i didn't get an apology after i bit into a f**king ROCK that was in my food.

I've come here most often on double-dates or when showing out-of-towners a good time. While I've eaten inside before, I prefer scoring a table outside when the weather (and Hoboken permits) will allow. The place is small, lively and festive. Plan for a little bit of a wait as they don't take reservations and given the size of the place, there's usually a bit of a wait. On the plus, the hostess is willing to take your phone number down and call you when a table is ready... very convenient if you live close by or opt to hang at a bar in the meantime.Food is just what you're looking for in Mexican fare. Their guac is a must- they come right to the table to make it in front of you, which turns the whole process into a bit of a show.

I've sampled a few entrees on their menu including the quesadillas and salads, and everything has been very tasty. The ambiance is a little divey but also very cozy. It's very colorful, with paintings of Frido Kahlo and other icons gracing the walls . It's a small restaurant (it only seats about 15 people total) but in the nice weather there is a good amount of outdoor seating.The prices are reasonable, ranging from $10.00-$30.00 for an entree. They don't serve alcohol but it is BYOB (you can bring wine and they will make a delicious Sangria for you that compliments the food nicely). The service can be slow at times (it gets crowded) because there is usually only one or two waiters, so it's not the best place to go if you're in a rush. Otherwise, I definitely recommend stopping by!",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

On both recent occasions,  the group I was with was ignored for almost 20 MINUTES without water or chips and salsa or even a hello. When we asked to sit outside we were told everyone had to order meals or we'd have to sit indoors. Keep in mind the outdoor seating area was completely empty. Since i enjoyed the first meal I ordered at the Uptown location i figured I would order the same thing again only to be told they couldn't make the same thing as the other location. The most recent visit to Charritos I wasn't super hungry so I was splitting the guac with another person when I was told if I wasn't ordering a meal it would be a $5 sharing plate fee. I understand they need to make up for lack of liquor license from food but that should not mean a $15 guac appetizer that uses only 1 avocado to share between people.

From the looks of it, they have seating for just a little over 20 people! However, if you're looking for a nice place to take a date on a weekday (or even a weekend, if you don't mind a wait), then it's an excellent place to consider.The waiters were very busy when I went there, but that was perfectly reasonable given that the place was mostly packed. In fact, when I went, a couple was seated before me by accident, and when I went to reclaim my table, they had to wait almost 15 minutes for a spot to open up! Nonetheless, the service was on-point, and considering that they didn't poke fun at my terrible Spanish accent, I would assume that they are receptive to those that are trying to practice their Spanish.Though others are saying that it's BYOB, I thought I saw a pretty vast selection of alcoholic drinks available. Then again, I ordered a Sprite, so I could easily be wrong. I ordered a small chicken quesadillla expecting to receive a lot, but I was happily surprised that it was as small as they said it was (though it came with plenty of beans). The chips they serve are fantastic as well, and since I indeed saw a waiter mashing guacamole for another couple across from me, though I wouldn't know how much  more ""authentic"" that makes it.The price was very reasonable, though it's within the range of its neighboring restaurants. For the inexperienced, this means that one should prepare their wallet accordingly if going with a group.

Ownership here has NO CLUE how to treat customers. This wasn't a one time slip-up. When I go there I couldn't be nicer, and in return I get attitude and ungrateful service. If you like their guacamole, here's how to make it at home just as good. Pick 2 ripe avocados, chop a de-seeded jalapeno and some white or red onion into fine dice, add some cilantro and lime juice, salt and pepper, mash with potato masher, and done....there ya go!

There was more than enough food on each platter and the free chips & salsa when you sit down is icing on the cake. If you're wondering what I ate - I stuck with a fundamental - chicken fajitas (it's hard to mess this dish up) and my boyfriend ordered a trio of meats over... cactus? Yes, it was odd... but it was delicious. The cactus it self was really gross - not my style - but again, the meats were cooked perfectly.Atmosphere - The place is quaint, cute and cozy. Try to sit outside if you can... people-watching on Washington is always fun.  The servers were extremely attentive and accommodating.  And, little added bonus - they present the check in a little wallet-purse type thing. When two men were sitting next to us and the wallet-purse was sitting on the table, I really enjoyed thinking one of them was carrying a murse... until we received one, as well.Alcohol - Charrito's is BYO, so be sure to do so. Apparently they make pretty good sangria & margaritas, but I haven't tried them yet.  If you forget, you can always run right across Washington to the liquor store.Overall - Good experience.

The downtown location is tiny and if its a weekend night, don't even bother, this place isn't worth waiting for and you'll find better food right down the street.This place is also way over priced for the quality of food that they offer.

Though my actions later in the day might disprove this theory, I'm really torn with this debate and am open to commentary. I wish we got our guac spicier, but it was definitely fresh and tasty. The chicken fajita dish was delicious, huge and not nearly finishable by one individual, yet they only give you 4 small tortillas? I'm not really complaining--I was really full after 3 fajitas, but it's just clearly not enough tortilla for all that fajita. Lastly, the chicken burrito was huge and the ingredients were all there and good, but it was a little too... smokey.

I had the mole chicken and for the price I got a half chicken, refried beans, 2 types of cheese, and rice/corn mix and wow was it tasty. not overly spicy or dry and the meat pulled right off the bone with a fork. sister had the flautas which I've only seen before on diners, drive ins, and dives and they were very well done. perfect sauces on top to perfect the dish. mother had the tamales and though they weren't the best, you get two sizable banana leaves with plenty of filling and it's technically an appetizer. although we didn't take full advantage the restaurant is BYOB and will make you pitchers of sangria or margaritas for $9! this is a wonderful, family owned and very authentic Mexican restaurant with easy access to so many different stores in the area.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

344,Jw2auwDVBZLiQvJmjk9wwQ,JP A.,4.0 star rating,"One of the best things that came out what I call my 'short term Martha sentence' in NJ (I moved from Seattle to Hoboken for a year). I may have run back to Seattle at the first opportunity but I do miss Charrito's. I even nicknamed them - little (the smaller restaurant of the two) and big - the one further down on Washington toward Weehawken. Anywhooo - here is the review... The guacamole is the best - really! They make it fresh and tableside with avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, and lime - salting to your taste. It is AMAZING! The chips are always fresh too!  The chicken mole is delicious - authentic! The chicken verde enchiladas literally melt in your mouth. I have yet to find better verde in the states and yes I have been to Mexican food. The chicken they use is moist and yummy! The margaritas are good and the service is great - when you can get a table right away. The only downside is like all great small restaurants, it can be difficult to get in sometimes. Tried the Charrito's in Union City too - their portions were a little larger and the prices were less, I was confused by that but none the less the food was just as good. Limited English was spoken so I did have to whip out my basic Spanish skills. If I could give it a 4.5 stars I would. During my last visit to NYC, I did want to take the ferry over to Charrito's but it was too difficult of a sell to the Seattle Charrito's virgin I was with... sad for my tummy!

The restaurant is more standard Mexican than let's say Mesa Coyoacan in Williamsburg (which really ups the ante with the cool crowd and mezcal/tequila offerings). However, the food at Charrito's was good enough to light my taste buds on fire. The restaurant had the standard make-your-guac tableside schtick but what I loved was that you could also bring your own wine and they would use it to make a fresh and tasty sangria for you (perks of a BYOB spot - can never find enough BYOBs in NYC!).

There are many great offerings at Charritos. As I eagerly tried to spy on what other people were having, I realized we could not go wrong, whatever we ordered. Everything looked outstanding, and the smell in the restaurant was enough to convince us we'd made the right decision.I went with the Enchiladas de Pollo. It came with two sauteed chicken enchiladas, yellow rice, refried beans, sour cream, salsa... it was a huge plate that seriously could have been shared between two people. Everything was incredible!

389,e3FqnSf0Bzfj77AA1gd3cQ,shawn m.,4.0 star rating,"Alright, any place that is BYO gets a thumbs up in my book.  And, you add in the fact that they will actually mix up your tequila for margaritas or take your wine and make up Sangria and I'm sold.  The BYOs that i've been too previously have not done this.Aside from the BYO aspect the food was extremely tasty.  I didn't try the guac as everyone is raving about on here, but the tampiquena was tender and flavorful.  I don't remember hearing any complains from my buddy on the enchiladas either.  I sat outside so I was comfortable, but the inside did look extremely tiny and would make me think twice about coming here if the weather isn't pleasant.  As it was, I did wait about 15 minutes in front of the restaurant after I'd given my name to the waiter.  Which brings me to the only real issue I had with the place was the lack of attentiveness when I arrived.  I wasn't sure who was taking names so it took about 5 minutes to flag down a waiter to get that take care of.  Overall though, not a big deal as I'd definitely come back again.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Maybe its the pitcher of sangria I drink when I go there or maybe its the fact that you have to bring your own booze so it costs less, but it is wonderful. I definitely recommend going when you can sit outside because the inside is small and a little tight, but once you start shoveling tortillas in your face you barely notice anyway. One time I brought a bottle of Patron for them to make a margarita with and I have a sneaking suspicion that the bus boys downed half the bottle. Oh well, they deserved it after the messes I've left in that place.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

This week's voyage brings them to...Hoboken. Town of underdressed hipsters and enough food to choke a cow. In other words, we love it there.We were going to see our friends Spiraling play at Maxwells, and rather than walk 11 blocks from the PATH in the bitter cold unfed, we decided to stop along the way for some substanance. Charritos was like the rainbow in the sand...huge platters of food (I got the pollo asado and I think an entire family of chickens were massacred to create it), delicious and very affordable. We did discover though that it is necessary to BYOB, so we were sangria-less, sadly. We know for next time though, bring a bottle of wine and make Charritos an even more delectable experience...plus, homemade tortilla chips and spicy fresh guac make Aly(lies) happy girls.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

405,lVej0VKEmNxHD3N2E0UgzQ,Jake F.,5.0 star rating,"Simply the best Mexican around.  Everything here is extremely delicious and flavorful - even the free chips and salsa.  It's BYOB, but they will mix you some margaritas or sangria (basically adding ice, sugar water and some freshly chopped apple) for a fee.  It's a good way to get rid of a cheap bottle of wine, but I prefer to down a beer or two with dinner.  The place is tiny, so expect a wait on the weekend, especially in winter.  Takeout is always an option.The guacamole is always prepared tableside with vibrantly freshed ingredients.  The mole sauce is a real treat, a little on the sweet swide but full of all the complexities and palate-pleasing you desire.  My favorite is the burrito de estilo fajita.  It is a huge burrito sliced into three pieces and filled with sauteed onions, mushrooms, green peppers, brocolli, steak or chicken, and a satisfying amount of gooey cheddar cheese.  However, all of the menu items seem to be winners at this amazing mexican joint.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

You don't need an appetizer since they give you chips and salsa which can slowly fill you up. The burritos are huge and the tacos aren't as large as I would like. The sauces seem fresh, I will need to eat here a few more times to see if they do use fresh ingredients. I do like their salsa. The place can only hold about 15-20 people.

As for food, the appetizers (app sampler) were awesome, very tasty, especially the guacamole and the quesadillas. Dinner wise, my group was 2 for 4, one person got the quesadillas which were as great as the appetizer ones but on a bigger scale of course. Another person ordered the tri-meat fajitas which were fantastic! The fajitas were the envy of the table, the meats (chicken, shrimp, and beef) was very tender and the flavors were great as were the fresh tortillas. Now for the downfall.....one other person and myself order the chicken poblano and all I have to say is....do not get the chicken poblano, although it was waiter recommended, it was very bland and the sauce had no flavor what so ever. Our dish practically ruined dinner for us, but the fajitas saved it, as thus earned the restaurant 3 stars.Los Charrito's is a decent to good restaurant, just be careful what you order. My advice is to stick to the classics and you can't go wrong.P.S. The portions are HUGE.",Charrito’s,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
