1,-jNxEJzXNWtbCy5VEyS3Lw,Mark A.,5.0 star rating,"What a awesome place!! It's located on the corner of sixth in Hoboken New Jersey, usually difficult to find parking any day but I found parking in the front on a saturday, lucky me! It is a mission burrito slash convenient store so don't get confused the kitchen is in the back! ...the owner soon as I walked in offered me free coffee since they just started prepping the kitchen for the day and I had to wait a few min before I could place my order, so I went with the steak and chicken burrito...yes I order for two for myself haha #fatboyproblems ...my god the burritos are HUGE, no exaggeration...looks like plenty of left overs for me....the food was fresh, rice well cooked, beans were good...I mean if you want good Mexican food to go this is it! Price for both meal came to about 25$...about 12$ and change each which is pretty good being in Hoboken with the awesome portions!",Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
2,m_UNGZjEJxNKzrF4kf8PwQ,Alyssa D.,1.0 star rating,Never delivered food when placed an order. The time for longer and longer until calling when they didn't answer. We had to call seamless who couldn't contact them either.,Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
3,a7Zis6KZ1w0F7agD48dAYQ,Jay H.,1.0 star rating,Is it Mission Burrito or Marina Deli? When I was walking by it was marina deli. I ordered their omelette with bacon & avocado through pointing because the only guy that was working did not speak English. I got an egg patty with a quarter of an avocado and a strip of bacon on the side. Don't order from here.,Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"

5,hk1OLC_3zY5NfslWACpnxQ,Jen R.,1.0 star rating,"We placed an order through seamless and were excited to try this place based on the good ratings.  We were told our order would be delivered by 8:20 pm.  We tried to patiently wait until 8:40 even though this place is only 3 blocks from us.  Eventually we called and got a ""full voicemail box"".  Seamless refunded our money, but obviously there is no concern for customer service at this establishment.",Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
6,gILvQQigdI2m-HK6GgZkHw,Angelica R.,1.0 star rating,"Possibly the worst waiting time ever. All I ordered was a chicken quesadilla. It took over an hour and a half, after the estimated delivery time, just to get to me.",Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
7,kcnrIpa-PESeHmmL35uxJw,Erica S.,4.0 star rating,"Don't be confused by the deli sign. There's no sign for Mission Burrito but the deli still serves piping hot, delicious burritos and cheesy beans and rice. It's Mission Burrito - just no signage. Really good chicken burrito - fresh, a little spicy, huge portion. Really good!!!",Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
8,P9UuEjxSw-zyBuNhjDi3TQ,Brittany G.,5.0 star rating,Seriously the best Mexican I have found since moving to NJ. I was devastated when they left their JC location but partied like it was 1999 when I found out they reopened in  Hoboken.,Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
9,lR1i6LY8N0o2SJ4nn10BHw,Ian B.,1.0 star rating,Delivery was inedible. My tacos had so much water and grease at the bottom of the container that the tortilla broke apart. The quesadillas weren't grilled and fell apart. I was hoping for a solid Mexican spot outside of taco truck but this place sadly didn't even come close.,Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
10,n9SAYib5jJsLmn62uVOnYQ,J L.,5.0 star rating,"Mission Burrito is open again!  This is Christmas morning. No, it is. So glad these guys are back -- the best casual Mexican food in the area. Don't let the, um, modest storefront deter you -- these guys know what they're doing. Ordered from their Jersey City Heights location every week for years -- and now they're right down the block in Hoboken. CHRISTMAS. MORNING.",Mision Burrito,2.5 star rating,,"Mexican,, Grocery,, Convenience, Stores"
