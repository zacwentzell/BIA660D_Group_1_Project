Otherwise, I think coconut is meh. This tiny, take-out esque restaurant is cleaner than it appears and produces tasty curry. I opted for the green curry with chicken and was pleased to find the portion and taste was perfect. Just enough sweetness to spicy ratio, without giving me a tummy ache. They also provided ample pieces of chicken. Bae ordered some time of shrimp noodle soup and they really didn't skimp on the shrimp. I think he counted about 10, which rarely happens.

I got the DRUNKEN NOODLES, GREEN CURRY, and the THAI STEAK SALAD. Everything was so good and tasted very fresh. The steak salad was probably my favorite...can't figure out what's in the sauce, but it's a little tangy and would go really well with some rice.

It was good, for appetizer we had Thai wings they were nice and sweet but not overly sweet. For the main course my fiancé had pad see ew with shrimp.

I needed to ask for hot sauce Bc I did not find the spice in it at all. But once they gave me some of there hot sauce it was amazing! I would go back just for that hot sauce lol! The beef was also very good it had different assortment of different cuts of meat. Very filling and I could not finish it in one sitting the portion was pretty big. We had fried banana with coconut ice cream for desert and boy oh boy that coconut ice cream was just grand! I just generally love the fried banana but the ice cream was so delicate and sweet very good way to end our meal. We had a 3 course meal and the bill wasn't more then 40 and it was great food.

They know that dish will be their workhorse so they need to make a decent version of it. I'm thrilled to find that they do a good job with it. I also like their pad see ew, drunken noodles, and crispy salmon. For appetizers, I like their tom yum soup, curry puffs, shiitake spring rolls, and Thai chicken wings. The dip for the puffs and rolls is the same sauce that the wings are covered in - a sweet and tangy sticky sauce. They also use this same sauce on their salads, as well as on the crispy salmon.

My favorites are the drunken noodles, pad thai, and tom yum.2) The people are nice and service is quick.3) The restaurant is kind of small, but most people take their food to go so there isn't usually a problem getting a table for a sit down meal. The decor and ambiance are pretty nice, very chill.4) Street parking available, both metered and non-metered.5) There's a $10 minimum for credit.

I get it every time and I hear others ordering it too when I go. It's perfect crispy salmon nuggets in a Peking style duck sauce. It's heavenly. You can also get it with sticky rice which makes it so much more fun to eat. Otherwise, the pad Thai is a safe bet - nothing spectacular but pretty good.

Yummy.I followed a yelpers review of Thai wings.  Four arrived on a plate drenched in a sweet and hot orange chili with green onions.  The plate was pretty.  I enjoyed the sauce and even the lightly battered fried skin of the wing, but the wing meat, especially close to the bones was unpleasant.  It taste of frozen meat that had been in deep freeze for a very long time. Ick!I returned them, offered to pay for the partially eaten wing, which they refused to accept.  They simply took the order off the bill.  Brava.The shrimp pad Thai was beautifully presented and was absolutely delicious!  I only wish the shrimp were jumbos rather than large.  The portion size for their lunch plate was perfect.My waitress, while she spoke little English was attentive and managed my table well.She earned the tips, she was a staff of one during some brisk business.

Really great portion as well, loaded with chicken.The fried rice was super delicious as well and not the usual oily, kind of gross, I feel nasty afterwards fried rice. The smoke sweet chil dish was equally delicious. Yet, this was where it was a huge heaping portion of white rice and just a little bit of the actual dish of veggies and steak.

(Curse, you, Fitbit, for goading me into obtaining my 10,000 steps per day. But that's another story...)Thank goodness the drunken noodles with chicken I had ordered lived up to the very positive reviews previous Yelpers have posted. I was able to discern the basil and chili from the many ingredients in their concoction, a task that many similar Thai-inspired eateries in the NJ/NY/CT tri-state area have difficulty accomplishing with success. With respect to flavors, I would consider the dish to be more on the light tangy side as opposed to spicy, but that is certainly not necessarily a negative critique. Most importantly, the noodles were neither bathed in grease nor bombarded with a large amount of monosodium glutamate or any other salt. I have one particular gripe, which is why I did not bestow this establishment a full four stars. I did not have any cash on me that night, and this place enforces a $10 minimum on credit cards a little too strictly. My order came out to $9.63 including tax, and instead of just allowing me to charge that amount, the cute, friendly girl at the counter hesitated, then conned me into buying a can of ginger ale for $1.50. I rarely ever drink soda, but at least she apologized for not having water.Oh well, I don't hate them for it by any means. 888 is a very lucky number in Chinese circles, anyway, haha.

Its fine, but not great.We ordered the Crispy Chicken Dumplings, Chicken and Basil, and Drunken Noodles with Beef.  The Chicken Dumplings need to be eaten fresh, so I cant blame them for the breading being soggy by the time they got home.  The filling was very tasty and I loved the dipping sauce, kind of a thicker sweet soy sauce than you usually get.  The Chicken and Basil and Drunken Noodles both had the same issues.  The dishes were both tasty, but the meat was cooked to death.  They were both dry, and the beef was really tough, like beef jerky.  Unless we find another place that we like much better, we will probably try them more, but I am going to keep looking.",Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

We had one order of spring rolls (4 pieces), which were stuffed with delicious, fresh sauteed mushrooms. Yum! I wanted to try the wings but wisely decided to save them for another time. Like many others, I judge a Thai place on its Pad Thai. Theirs was sweet and a bit tangy, and the shrimp were grilled to perfection. Toppings were cooked very well and the sauce was incredibly flavorful. The portion was also huge and I was definitely stuffed by the time we left.

The sauces that came with it were a little funky; didn't really match the flavor of the dish.Thai Chicken Wings - Good flavor as well, just a little too syrupy and salty for my liking.Green Curry - One of the better green curries I've had. I would order this again.Drunken Noodles - Ditto. Probably the favorite dish of the night.Thai Basil Rice - Pretty salty; all we could taste was soy sauce.Pad Thai - Sweetest pad thai I've ever tried. Should've sent this back to the kitchen and asked them to remake it.Glad to see a Thai restaurant in the area but the flavor of some dishes need work.",Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

It's the first Thai restaurant to open up in the area adding a little diversity to Central Ave. The lunch specials come with an appetizer and the main entree for only $7.50 and add a Thai iced tea and you're looking at a complete meal for just under $10. I've had the pad Thai and the drunken noodles as well as the chicken dumplings and spring rolls. So far the pad Thai and the chicken dumplings are my favorite combo. Doesn't look a lot serving wise but is sure to fill you up and is full of flavor.

We stopped here for a quick little lunch date on a Thursday and let me tell you we were quite impressed! We each got a salad and split two appetizers. The food was fresh and delicious, the service was quick and it was pretty empty. (There are maybe 6 tables in the restaurant). Oh...and the price is definitely right. The only thing about this place that I think could be improved is the decor of the restaurant. It seems a bit too fast food-ish for the quality of the food and there's a lot of potential for this place. Conclusion: YAY!

I just prefer my wings more on the spicy than sweet side. My fried rice was cooked to perfection and had plenty of chicken throughout. A lot of places will skimp on the meat but this place does not. My husband said his curry was spicy just like he asked for it and that it was delicious. All of the portions were on the larger side and I was able to take about half my rice home.

The tables, chairs and floor are sticky and had a greasy feel wherever you sit. Took 15min for our server to finally come, no excuse since the place only has 6 seating (its a hole in the wall). We order our usual food and came 30min. We ordered two servings of their fried flat noodles and looks like they cooked one serving and overloaded the plate with lettuce and split the servings (this is compared to all the previous times we ordered and the sizings was enough for me and one of my kids). We complained and were told the servings were right... ok (tip just went down 5%). After all said and done, our bill came and we handed them our 10% discount card. The bill came back with no return of our discount card (note we having been using this card for well over a year now). Server comes back stating the manager cut it up due to some new policy...

On my first visit I ordered: Shrimp rolls - Delish! I will get this again, the bag comes with about 5 shrimp rolls (give or take didn't really count) for $5 Yellow Curry - OMG better than I expected! The curry was rich, flavorful with lots of chicken and veggies. The jasmin rice was fine, what you would expect from your white rice. Second visit I ordered:Lunch special! Didn't even know they had one! For $7.50 you get a choice of a listed appetizer and a listed entree. The entree itself is smaller than what you would get if you ordered the dinner portion but it was more than enough to fill me up. Shitake spring rolls - Perfect! The dough/wrap/what ever was nice and thin and crispy. It came with a sweet sauce.side note: I have stayed away from ""spring rolls"" and ""egg rolls"" over the years due to the massive amount of dough and heart attack inducing size that you usually get in the Chinese food places on Central Ave. This has the perfect amount of fried goodness! Drunken noodles - Really good and spicy, I had to keep drinking water in between bites. I was hoping to find more chicken in the dish, but nonetheless it was a great meal. P.S.

The few times that I've actually picked up food I notice that the people eating there aren't getting much service due to the fact that there's usually only one person working there and that person is usually taking orders over the phone. 50% of the time I don't get exactly what I order and from the sound of the person at the front speaking with unhappy customers on the phone sounds like I'm not alone. I don't blame that person it might be a miscommunication between them and the cook who knows.. What I do know is had this not been the only Thai restaurant in a 5 mile radius I'd probably never eat there again but since it is I'm probably going to still eat there just won't be happy about having to go back to get the right order after they screw it up again.

148,5Yb0ZMXV1g_wAap78UOvvg,Sandra B.,3.0 star rating,Was psyched to try noodlefan after reading the yelp reviews. It was.... Totally fine. Nothing exciting to report. Tried oxtail soup and drunken noodles with chicken and tofu. It was good but not good enough to go out of my way to one here again. Pricing is fair as are portions.,Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

150,ci5nDCpXx1kXoBzh4cjaCw,Tom P.,4.0 star rating,"Shrimp salad not recommended. Wife said drunken noodle was okay. Beef noodle soup was good. Service was good but we were the only ones there.  The place just open and I will try it again. I would have to say that so far it's the best Thai restaurant in jersey city, I have been to them all twice. This is coming from a person who traveled to thailand over 20 times and eats Thai food at least twice a month for the past 35 years. Would recommend for people to give it a try.",Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

152,2HSzj3Y7ZQw8lLHuyCaz2w,Melissa A.,5.0 star rating,So happy that there is some more diversity on central Ave. other than only Latin inspired food. The pad Thai was very good as were their spring rolls and dumplings. Also had their sweet and sour chicken and it was very tasty and flavorful. The sticky rice and iced tea are also delicious.

154,HiYzy-X3HT6rx6gynLAMpg,Amy K.,4.0 star rating,"Easy, quick place right in the heights. The food was very fresh and tasty. I gave 4 stars because it's good, solid Thai but not the best I've ever had. They are a little light on the sauce. Got the green noodle with tofu- really delicious and spicy just like I asked for. Also the spring rolls are great. Got the panang curry and it was good too. They don't have alcohol here, but they do take cards which is nice. Will definitely be going back. It was clean and the servers were very nice.",Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

158,kz7JwZuyqkwkx6QKbbTZpw,Doug B.,4.0 star rating,Very excited to have this quaint and wonderful Thai restaurant in the hood.  I've been a resident here for 4 years and the choices have always been decent Chinese or good Cuban (a popular restaurant directly across the street from this one comes to mind).Enter Noodlefan - smoking Thai food at proper JC Heights prices.  Case in point - Lunch Special was just $7 and includes and appetizer.  I chose the chicken dumplings and they were yummy.  Next on my lunch particular lunch menu was the Drunken Noodles which had a delicious smoky grilled flavor to it.  I'm a Thai food nut and am VERY excited to have this new addition to the hood.  Do yourself a favor and bring a friend for their Lunch Special to test it out - I don't think you'll be disappointed.,Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"

The green curry with tofu was sublime and my drunken noodles were delicious.  Sate was a little small but tasty. Everything tasted super fresh and balanced.  Waiter was quirky but very friendly and funny, and gave us no attitude when we discovered that neither one of us had brought money or a credit card!  Nice chatting about Thailand while my husband ran back home. Sticky rice for dessert had a lovely presentation with a perfect slice of fresh mango and was quickly devoured by our little ones.  Can't wait to go back and try more.  Nice to see that they aren't trying to do a huge menu and loose quality.  Very clean and modern inside. Please visit so they stay!",Noodlefan,4.0 star rating,$$,"Thai,, Noodles"
