1,U_UvZKuqTV35_R_QaUsVPA,Christina G.,4.0 star rating,"Officially our go to take out Chinese spot. It's super easy to order online, especially once you set up an account with them. The food is always ready in 20mins, and it's piping hot when we bring it home. Some of our favorites- the combo deal for one. Lots of different entrees to choose from (my fave is hunan chicken), and tons of options for the two sides you get to choose from. You pick from a variety of Rice's/ lo meins and then either a soup or spring/ egg roll. Usually ends up being $10 for a ton of food! I'm normally a fried rice fan, but the lo mein here is the winner. It's so tasty. The egg rolls and soups are also good. Crab Rangoon is another appetizer well done here. The few things I wouldn't order again are the scallion pancakes and chicken wings. Both were soggy. This is strictly takeout/ delivery. There are only a few stools to sit on inside.",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

For $12.31 I got chicken in garlic sauce, chicken with broccoli, two orders of wonton soup, and two generous sides of brown rice (but you can also get white or fried rice - lo Mein is an extra buck). While not amazing, it was all quite good. And afterwards, I felt very satisfied rather than so full I wanted to pull the trigger then hungry again 15 minutes later.Here's what I liked:-they were generous with the wontons which were light and yummy-the chicken wasn't grisly and there was plenty of it, not all vegetables-the sauces were flavorful but not heavy or greasyHere's what could be improved:-the broth for the soup was totally flavorless-they packed forks and spoons, no knives, chopsticks or sauces, if you want them, request them-no crispy noodles for the soup, suppose that goes against their low fat concept-garlic chicken was advertised as spicy, not so much Excited to chow down here again.",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

All the meat is completely identifiable and they don't skimp on it. I ordered General Tso's chicken and it was actually huge chunks of chicken with very minimal breading. It was amazing! Their fried rice is amazing as well. It's still white, so I assume it's lightly fried or something, and the flavor is amazing. Best fried rice I've ever had. Thirdly, the place is clean. What more could you ask for?Everything tastes real here. There's no question about what you're eating. It's real food that you don't have to feel so guilty about eating.

The orders are prepared promptly. 99% of the time my order is waiting when I walk through the door. I heavily favor the Chicken and Broccoli in Garlic Sauce. The same order with Ginger sauce is great but I find the garlic sauce to be much tastier. Last night I had the General Tso's Chicken with Chicken Fried rice and that was also great. The portion sizes are pretty big and I often find myself splitting my meal into two.As I already mentioned this is my ""go to"" place when I am working in the area. I enjoy the food and the prompt service. So I will continue to order from here!",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

53,gMQxreLHgVqVIWn7t1G9og,Uttara D.,1.0 star rating,"Warning - This is a review solely based off the customer service! Went in to order some food and walked in to the owner yelling at one of the staff members. Decided to place an order for some soup and dumplings. We wanted to know what ingredients were part of the veggie dumplings and the owner responded in a remarkably snappy tone saying ""mixed vegetables"" and when we asked her to specify what types since we have some allergies, she merely said ""just order something off the menu that you can see"". I found that to be a rather obnoxious response! As the owner shouldn't you know the food you are selling; whether it was laziness in not wanting to converse with customers or mere ignorance at the type of food being sold - either way, that's not how you grow a business!Oh and now a review on the dumplings - we ordered the chicken dumplings which were super doughy and not very flavorful! Well this place was definitely a Debbie downer! On to the next spot!",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

My husband and I each got a dinner meal portion as well as veggie lo meon to share. I had the wonton soup. Everything was delicious, and I was surprised at how ""light"" the meal actually felt. As others have suggested, if you live in Hoboken, the online order form is super convenient. We will definitely order from here again.",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

60,LhIA4A7rRdPm8E7nGeeCAw,Mike V.,3.0 star rating,"I can't speak for the veracity of their low fat claims but it tasted healthier enough. It also tasted a little bland. I guess that's what you get for trying to get healthy Chinese food. The tom yum soup was the best thing I had here, while some of the other dishes weren't overly impressive but not deflating. I guess the best thing you can say about this place is that the online ordering system works well. Ordered on the website and picked it up with no wait and no issues. But the ordering process shouldn't be your high point at a restaurant.My review in five words: It is what it is.",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

68,4tqNQiHFepfXIMbO3EJ1-A,Shirley S.,4.0 star rating,Decent chinese food.  There are a few dishes I'd stay away from. We like their lo mein and shrimp dishes.  Their sesame chicken was not good.  We ordered the chicken an rice soup and the rice soaked up all the soup. So it was like chicken w really wet rice when we got it.  I love their wonton soup though and their sweet and sour soup is good too.  My husband likes their spare ribs. Their lunch special is priced well and it's a good amount of food. Around $7 for the meal w rice and a small soup.,Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

I got the dinner combo with hot garlic chicken, fried rice and hot and sour soup. Added the Asian spring roll to meet the $10 minimum for delivery. Ten bucks for all that food. What?! I couldn't even eat half of it and I'm stuffed which is surprising because I am a big eater. Leftovers will be tomorrow's dinner and I will enjoy every bite. Everything was great and I don't feel gross after eating it which is a first for having Chinese food. To top it all off the delivery guy (with cool funky hair) arrived in 30 minutes on the dot and everything was piping hot. I'll definitely be ordering from here again when I get my occasional Chinese food craving.",Lo-Fatt-Chow,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

The food was delicious, the service was fast, the prices were great and the staff was incredibly friendly. I did not realize that I had to specifically choose white or brown rice on their online ordering website, or else they would send you no rice. I'm used to white rice being the default. Our order came in about 30 minutes or less. When there was no rice I called and they nicely explained my mistake, but sent over someone to drop off rice.
