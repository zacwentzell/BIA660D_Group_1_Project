One minute my De Churro was the thing of perfection, and the next the whipped cream was sliding to the left and the dulce de leche melted all over the wafel, making a mess. An ugly delicious mess.Their Spekuloos spread (sold in jars) tastes something like gingersnap caramel sugar cookies. Yes it's insane. I've had it on toast, over ice cream, mixed into hot cocoa, all over my blouse, etc. It's best on one of W&D's crispy wafels, but will have to tide me over until the next visit.

5,XIVhlE211QvcDkoZtmZ1uw,Fox E.,5.0 star rating,"If this place were named after my reviews, they'd have to change it to ""Waffling & D**k-jokes."" I may be prone to verbal diatribe and childish humour (if you can call it humour), but at least I'm self-aware. Then again, they said Leopold of Belgium was self-aware, and that didn't help him much. Speaking of which, we did an online poll of ""sexiest somewhat feminine actors"" and Leo-polled highest. DiCaprio that is. So on with the review.What to get: Liege Waffle with Spekuloos.What the f*** is Spekuloos: It's when you can't find your glasses. Duh.And what else: Well, the Spekuloos Ice Cream is pretty amazing too.What's the difference between a Liege Waffle and the other kind?: Well, the other kind are good, but this one is in a Liege of its own.But this is in America, not Belgium: I know. And much like 'Murca, if you don't like it, then why don't you liege.If this place were frequented by ducks rather than humans, and was also really dirty inside, then it'd be called ""Waddles & Dingy."" Whereas if I had a bright idea (lightbulb switches on above my head, cartoon style) about time travelling, then it'd be ""Wormholes & Ding!""I won't go on and on about these waffles. I'll just tell you straight away: these are by far the best waffles I've ever had in the United States. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but when I go to Belgium, I fall in love with the taste of the dense, sticky, orgasmic Liege Waffles, perfected at Maison Dandoy in Brussels. Well these may not be on the MD level, but these are the closest thing you will ever find in North America, that's for sure. They taste a lot more Belgian than they do American, and that is a very, very good thing.People ask why I'm so attracted to Borat. I think it was his ""Onesies & Dimples."" It must be that because it ain't his face. He's a tip drill.Adding the Spekuloos just takes it through the roof. It's a Gingerbread Spread (think Nutella, but even more addictive), which comes - of course - from Belgium. Also known as Belgique (French) or Belgie (Flemish). Flemish is basically like Dutch, but a Belgian version of it. The country is split between the two languages. The French speakers are known as Walloons. But history and geography lessons aside, Belgium really does make the best waffles on earth, and these Liege Wafles with Spekuloos really are the closest thing to the real thing you can get over here.If you're in a ""linen cleaning contest"" make sure you get the linens *absolutely* clean. Because if there's a tiny bit of dirt, even a little speck of dust, you lose. This concept is known as ""Speck-u-lose.""Not only am I obsessed with them (and I'm not even a waffle fan), but everyone I've ever taken here, fell in love with them too. They're sticky and gooey and hot and sexy. They're heavenly and divine and delectable and filling too. You can split one with someone since they're heavy, and they're not too expensive either.I'm not sure whether there are any illegal drugs in the Spekuloos. I'd rather not Spekulate.As I said, get the amazing Spekuloos all over them, and be aware that they also have Spekuloos (Gingerbread) Ice Cream here which is absolutely divine as well. They're open extremely late (usually until 11 or Midnight or later, but it seems to vary and they do close a bit before the posted time). They're on a lovely little street corner in a cute part of Manhattan just north of Houston St and not far from Sunny & Annie's 24 Hour Korean Deli (which is amazing too - I just reviewed it).Oh and you know that movie, Star Trek III: The Search For Spock? Well in Belgium, that movie was known as ""Spock-u-lost.""If you come to Manhattan, you simply must make it a point to stop in here and try a Liege Waffle with Spekuloos. It may just be one of the best desserts you will ever consume in America.If I have a whole bunch of girls asking to be spanked, then I'd rather save the best for last, honey. And since you're the best, that means I'm going to ""Spankulast.""Wafles & Dinges. Get here. Be amazed.Although if it were my 2 favourite things to get in back alleys in Chinatown, then it'd be ""Won-Ton & D**k.""

I loved all the chocolate sauce drizzled over the waffle and the blend of ice cream with the texture of the waffle. However, after about 3-4 bites, it was just too overwhelmingly sweet. Strawberry walnut waffle (4/5): this is the lighter of the two waffles we got. The sourness of the strawberry did balance out the sweet sauces. However, there was nothing that ""special"" about this waffle.

I would pass the Wafels and Dinges truck on my way to work everyday. I decided that one day when I would get to Columbus Circle very early, I would stop and get a waffle before work. That day was a life-changing day in terms of food experiences... and most possibly spiritual experiences. I walked up to the truck and ordered the Throwdown Waffle. I had never tried speculoos until then and was very curious about it. Cookie butter spread? That had to be something good. I took my warm waffle and walked to a nearby bench. I took a bite out of my waffle and all of a sudden the whole city... went quiet. And before I knew it, I was floating on a cloud. It is the most interesting experience for the whole island of Manhattan, in all of its noise and hustle n' bustle, to all of a sudden be blocked out for a solid ten minutes. I was at peace and felt quite ethereal eating a large, fluffy waffle, with my new love of cookie butter and whipped cream. It is since then that I call speculoos, ""the new Nutella.""It was on my Bucket List to experience bliss.

You get one dinges (topping) free and each one is another buck. Liege Waffle w/ Strawberries and Peanut Butter - $6.43 + $1 - Liege waffles are oval shaped vs the belgian which is square.

I used to eat wafels & dinges obsessively circa 2013. I stalked the trucks, religiously visited them at the Christmas Shoppes and even followed their Facebook account for updates. Okay, maybe it was more of a stalker relationship. Anyway, life or the general cut back on sugar idea kicked in and I gave my beloved wafels a break--until this morning. I was hastily making my way to the train station when a familiar scent danced it's way into my olfactory nerve and almost robotically, I found my body doing a u-turn and standing in the wafel line. So here I was. I wish I could say it was voluntary, but it was almost automatic. As a compromise, I didn't do the usual Nutella, strawberry, banana works. Instead, I just opted for a liege with strawberries. I'm happy to say the wafels are still chewy and just a tad sticky as I lovingly remember them. Thank you, Wafels.

If you are an ice cream lover, you could top it off for extra $2. Unlimited toppings is $3. I am okay with one topping and an ice cream . For me, if you over top it, loses the waffle concentration.  Oh well, it depends on what you preference. The location is just perfect , in the middle of the park, close to the Delacorte theater ,  lots of  park benches nearby and easy garbage disposal access.

Arrived with a Groupon, that came with 2 savory waffles, 2 drinks, and 2 ice cream cones. The drinks only deserve 0 stars: tried the vanilla matcha chai and the regular chai, both iced. The lady behind the counter was clearly new, because she kept asking her coworker for help (who was on his laptop at the counter against the window). The chais were straight up just 90% milk & ice, and half a pump of a syrup of some kind. Ours tasted exactly the same, even though we ordered 2 different drinks. For $4.50 each, I would have given 0 stars if possible.The waffles get 1 star. My friend had the Smoked salmon waffle, and enjoyed it. I tried his, but felt the actual waffle was masked by the sour cream. The smoked salmon was a little too brown for me, but he didn't seem to notice.I got the ""Wake up, Grumpy"", with bacon. It was sickeningly sweet, charred bacon bits. The description said it came with a biscuit waffle, but I was served a hashbrown waffle, which was sour. The eggs were good (scrambled) but the meal didn't match the description.The ice creams deserved 4 stars. The cones were tasty, and the server offered to fill them with fudge before the ice cream, which was delicious. The spekaloos ice cream is incredible! Tiny scoops, but fantastic. While we were waiting for our ice cream, I saw 2 huge flies, flying around and landing quite often on the waffles that were pre-made, on display. I hope to God that those waffles are not served to customers, and they are only for show. I saw those flies hop around to almost every waffle, even when the waitress was nearby. Ahh!I will give them a positive remark, because they were offering free hot chai to passersby. A homeless man approached, and was physically unable to help himself to the vessel. The waitress kindly helped him get a cup, which I will give them another star for, because it was flat out gracious. 2 stars in total: despicable food & drinks, very good ice cream, flies actually touching the food and no one shooing them away, but kind to homeless strangers.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Okay so here's a little story which you probably aren't interested in, but I have the dire need to recite anyway. I have been the biggest Wafels and Dinges fan since I moved into the city which was almost three years ago. The truck was always parked right outside my campus, and there was a weekly sighting right outside my apartment complex. It basically haunted me wherever I went, probably because it simply knew that it had won over my heart. I've been a pretty firm believer in Wafels & Dinges long before they opened their relatively new cafe. I've made every single friend of mine try them out and popped their Wafels & Dinges cherry one too many times. Seriously, best thing ever. This is always a good idea. Now moving onto more important things...Try the liege waffle. You won't regret it. If you're too full and just want a mini dessert, which is usually the case for me, you can get a mini liege waffelini. It's like 3-4 bucks, I think, and you get unlimited toppings on it. Without fail, I always get nutella, strawberries, and a scoop of Spekuloos ice cream. Now, please do not underestimate the power of this heavenly creation called Spekuloos Ice Cream. Yes, it'll cost you an extra two bucks, but it is honestly the best thing and your taste buds will be partying all day and night long afterwards. I promise you.

I came to NYC for a few days to go on a crazy eating spree, and Wafels & Dinges was obviously on the list of must eat places so I was glad to have found the cart. I had just had brunch so I wasn't super hungry and just got the small waffle to try. I can't even remember what it's called, petite something I think. It was basically a petite wafel with a dinges, which I eventually realized was a topping. I got the dulce de leche. It took them awhile to make it despite me being the only customer there. I think I waited around five minutes for one tiny waffle? Am unimpressed. Anyways, it was a waffle with the dulce de leche paste on it sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet for me, though I recently realized that apparently I have a much higher tolerance for sweetness than the average person. It did get a bit overwhelming though since it is pretty heavy for a small dessert, and that was with the smallest size. Overall both the waffle and the dinge were both good but nothing overwhelmingly amazing. I'm glad I went since it seems to be one of the dessert staples in NYC, but wouldn't really bother going again but I do admit that it seems as though I didn't order the right thing? Will consult Yelp reviews more seriously in the future and might consider reviewing and rewriting if my opinions change.tldr; for now, it's an alright place but also not worth going out of the way for. it's just nothing amazing or special. and my experience was pretty slow",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I was so grateful that I only ordered one to share with my sister. Even then, we had a hard time finishing it.Wafels & Dinges is actually a couple of food trucks but this particular location is a permanent foodstand in the park. For the location of the trucks, you can look on their website as it changes daily.They are known for their cookie butter aka spekuloos. They sell jars of these things for you to take. I ended up forgetting to pack it into my check-in bag so TSA threw it away. I learned, however, that the jarred variety is not really any different from the ones you can get at Trader Joe's.

The spekuloos was delicious - great flavor and I loved the chewy texture of the wafle. But the other? Pure decadence. They were so generous with the fudge it seeped into the wafle a little.  The banana was a bright flavor and the whipped cream didn't taste artificial at all.  I'd wager it was home made.

So it was only fitting that I try the Belgian waffle from Wafels and Dinges, and that opportunity arose when the food truck was in the vicinity of where I was heading. I wish I had browsed the reviews prior to ordering because perhaps I would have had a better experience. But I didn't, and ended up $9 in the hole.  I opted for the savory side of the menu and ordered the Belgian waffle with the chicken and mushroom sauce. No bueno! The sauce is thick and while the mushrooms provided the flavor, that was it. The chicken was bland and so was the sauce if that makes sense. Basically without the bite of mushrooms, no taste at all. The Belgian waffle needed a firm crisp because with the sauce atop of it, the waffle became soft. Extremely soft. In addition, the meal was warm. Mind you, I was first in line and the only person in line. Translation:  there is no reason for food to come out warm and not hot.

It looks and feels like peanut butter but the taste is so magical, words won't do it justice. I can only say these waffles were the softest I've ever had. A bit of a crunch on the outside but the texture was made to perfection.It looks like they were also featured on Bobby Flay's show. Make sure you check them out and have them pile on the Spekuloos!",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Napkins and utensils are in the plastic drawer below the counter where they hand you your waffle. You only get one free pass to mess this up. After that, you'll look like a pitiful n00b.5.

The ""Brussels"" is crispy while the ""Liege"" is chewy. You can get a savory or a sweet waffle. Savory options include pulled pork or bacon toppings, and sweet toppings are endless. Dulce de Leche, fudge, nutella, fruit, or the classic butter and syrup.  The Spekuloos Spread (think gingerbread cookie butter; think ""this is what an angel would eat for breakfast"") with whipped cream is a sure-fire bet and what most employees will tell you is their favorite.Tonight I tried the pulled pork waffle. It was delicious, tender, full-of-flavor pork bathed in BBQ that you can get either mild or spicy. Next to it was a mound of sweet coleslaw and a coolickle (a what?! -- it's a cucumber pickled in Koolaid!). The dish is pretty sweet so it's not for someone who doesn't prefer sweet BBQ, but the pork takes the cake (or, er, the waffle). Also, it's to be eaten right away, carrying it home makes for a soggy waffle, but still delicious.

The total was $9 which I think is overpriced. The wafel looked a little burnt but was light and crispy. The wafel was layered with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, coleslaw and these red pickles? There was way too much coleslaw which overpowered everything. I ended up pushing all the coleslaw to the side. I couldn't taste the wafel at all, just that it was crispy. Pulled pork was average.

The idea of a waffle truck is a good one and I especially like that they offer both savory and sweet options.  For my first W&D experience I went with something sweet (just like me).  I got the mini waffle with ice cream for  about $5 which was reasonable considering the portion was just right. They offered about 4 ice cream flavors with one of them being new to me. . . Speculoos.  I sampled the Speculoos flavor which tasted just like a gingerbread cookie (or house) and although that small sample was gooood, I worried that it would become overwhelming in a larger quantity. With that said, being that the other flavors were pretty basic and I wasn't in a basic kind of mood, I just went for the ""new flavor"" and I'm glad that I did because it was the best part of my dessert (and not at all overwhelming). As for my waffle it's hard to say what I thought of it because it was a bit difficult to eat.  It was a bit hard (like WELL toasted bread, or better yet microwaved bread) and stuck to the packaging which made getting to it (a.k.a ripping off pieces) tough.  I'm sure both downfalls were because of the ice cream, which I enjoyed, but it took away from the 5 star experience that I'm sure could have been.  With that said, I'd definitely give W&D another shot and if I decide to get something with ice cream I'll be sure to ask if they can put it on the side.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

They always remained genuinely enthusiastic all while explaining their waffles time and time again to each customer. They really knew to draw in a crowd.The de Bacon + Syrup Wafel ($6.00) is a tasty treat. Bits of bacon are mixed in the batter, then thrown on the waffle maker grill. The waffle was sizable, about twice the size of a standard quarter (or half of a) Belgian waffle. The waffle was soft and chewy, but I like for my waffles to have a slight over-doneness to them so that they have a slight hard crunchy exterior. The bacon adds a subtle though not very noticeable saltiness to the waffle. I would have preferred for the bacon to be precooked more until hard and crispy. A waffle with bacon sound great conceptually, but the execution was lacking.If you're doubtful or curious about Wafels & Dinges, try a Mini Wafelini with chocolate syrup ($4.00), lathered and drenched until the point where you can't even see the wafel. Yum! This was definitely my favorite of the two, probably because I'm a chocolate fiend, and the warm chocolate syrup really took it over the top. And one word of advice, eat it quick so that the waffle doesn't get soggy.Wafels & Dinges sell some tasty treats. They are sure to please, but after frequenting many Waffle Cabins in the northeast, I've grown accustomed to the sweet Belgian pearl sugar found in their waffles. Wafels & Dinges can really learn a lesson or two from their northern competitors, to truly make them a lustful treat.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

The guy making the waffles in the truck was super friendly when we ordered. The waffle was actually not that pricey compared to everything else in NY.

So decided to give it a try.I did a quick glance at the menu. I first tried the belgian chocolate fudge, ohh man it was dead delicious. Probably the best wafel I had in a long time. Wafel with hot belgian chocolate on top just feels like I am in wafel heaven.Needless to say I tried the wafels again on other occassions and I really like them all specially the strawberry and belgian chocolate.The staff was cool and helpful.

You get to choose between the light and crispy Brussels wafel or the soft and chewy liège wafel. I've gone with the liège wafel both times I visited this cart and it was perfectly chewy. I personally don't like my waffles crispy or crunchy (like the waffles at Brown Sugar Kitchen). Dinges = toppings. Your first one is free and the second one is $1. If you're feeling carefree you can have unlimited toppings for $2. My favorite combination is Nutella and bananas.  Most wafels are $5-$7 and are relatively small for what you pay for.

I have to say that I sincerely hope the future of Wafels & Dinges is one where they open a sit down location.Today's first experience had me hooked. I discovered through pleasant chat with the lady working there, this cart accepts CARDS! AMAZING! This places them solidly on the avaunt garde of trucks. There is a $6 minimum for card use, but since a basic waffle with one topping is that much anyway...I was also thrilled to learn that Mondays are now their day at this location! (I was outside Target in Rego Park to go grocery shopping. Had I taken my normal Q29 bus and not the Q53, I'd never have seen it there. Fate was smiling.) *^_^*Having felt like death warmed over all weekend due to an illness, this delightful food made my busy Monday feel much more tolerable. The lady out front and the gentlemen making the food (Dutch I assume by his accent) were both friendly and happy to explain the choices and prices. While there are covers for the boxes your food is served in, the cook did say they are best when eaten straight away. I have to agree that this is a rule I follow with most fresh made goods such as pastry and breads.I sat on the garden like planters across from the truck and essentially inhaled my food after the first bite. I got the light & crispy waffle (since it was my breakfast today) and had it with fresh strawberries. I was delighted to see it came with powdered sugar dusted on top as well as whipped cream. ( I had not ordered the whipped cream.)Soon after, I was off on the days errands and feeling much filled by the food, though it was such an airy creation, I found myself not feeling stuffed, just well fed. Since I had Gastric Bypass a few years back, this was a welcome surprise. I brought a menu home for my husband and hope he gets to try it soon!

The batter used is cake-sweet on its own so be aware that it will get even sweeter with the powdered sugar and toppings.My least favorite of the ""dinges"" was the dulce de leche. Was far too rich for my taste.  The Nutella is self-explanatory.The spekuloos topping is one of the better ones. It has a nice genuine spice to it that you just don't normally get outside of the imported jars. Because the waffle is sweet on its own, I would still recommend the classic syrup. It's a decent stop when you have the specific hankering for waffles and sugar, but the quality and price ($6 per waffle) just doesn't justify it over cheaper and better homemade waffles.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Foolproof combination: speculoos spread, strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate fudge sauce. The fudge hardens on top of the ice cream, which is a nice touch that adds some texture. Speculoos spread is DELICIOUS -- think cookie butter. Your first ""dinges"" (topping) is free, if you have enough self control to order just one. The second one is $1 extra, and $2 will get you unlimited toppings...which I think is completely worth it. The Belgian waffle has a cake-y texture, but is still crisp on the outside. Despite all of the sugar that went into this dessert, I didn't find the sweetness overwhelming at all. I definitely recommend having it with vanilla ice cream because the coldness helps to neutralize the sugar overload (if that makes any sense...) My boyfriend tried it with walnuts and the gingerbread ice cream, which was also yummy. I don't even like gingerbread but I loved the subtle flavor in the ice cream.

As for the waffles, I ordered a soft liege wafel and my son got the more crunchy variety. My wafel was hot and soft and moist, smothered with spekuloos spread and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. We were enjoying our wafels so much --no, INHALING our wafels as if we were famished! -- that we forgot to half and trade pieces to try the other variety. Oh well.  Really good but slightly too sweet. Next time we'll have to opt out of the powdered sugar on top. But we both finished. We just couldn't resist the power of the spekuloos.

They were located right in the end, right by the parks benches. The workers there are really nice especially the guy on the outside greeting everyone. The first ever wafels we got was with their very own version of a cookie butter spread which is basically graham crackers all meshed and made into a spread (Trader Joes sells their own version) and the 2nd visit was again with that delicious cookie butter spread and diced bananas. OH MAHHH GAWWD the spread goes so well with the wafel and even better with the bananas. The wafels are soo good that it would probably be good by itself.

I also feel when you visit a restaurant/food truck the best way to tell if they really know their craft is to try the basics. With that being said while walking through the park there were dozens of food trucks. (I'm not from NY so I was buzzing with excitement!)I saw everyone walking around with these yellow cardboard containers full of waffle goodness. So when we finally spotted the Wafel & Dinges truck, I waited in line to purchase our 'wafles'. My friends opted to try their specialty flavors and festive toppings. I on the other hand wanted maple syrup and strawberries. Unlike my friends who purchased Belgium waffles, I ordered the liège waffle....here is an awesome description I found online - ""caramelized sugar glistening on the most delicious buttery-sweet treasure beneath""I took a bite of that waffle and for a moment everyone disappeared. I think I even saw a fawn walk by me. That waffle was the absolute best waffle in the world. **I wish I could add sound effects to this review** Back to the truck...so when I initially stepped up to the truck to place the order, even with a crazy long line, the guys working the truck were super cool. Not just general friendly customer service cool, but they were excited about their product, smiling, explaining things and cross selling. In the midst of the crowd ruckus, the truck seemed to be tidy and the waffle display was neat.So, I've never gotten in trouble on the highway with the law....but I do not think I could compose myself if this truck passed me....honestly once I finished my waffle (which I oddly ate quicker than my friends) if you were in the park that day it would have probably been a good idea to stay a few steps away from me ""if"" you had one of those containers of goodness in your hand. The ONLY reason why I didn't get back in that line for seconds was because we ordered grilled cheese sandwiches from another truck (My three friends and I are fatties! we strategically disbursed in three lines so we could have a Smörgåsbord of food truck food that day without waiting in the long lines)I swear, I'm counting the seconds until I visit NYC again....until I see that awesome truck again.

259,yQyQMgd5z3or1sZb1StFPw,GarGuPi L.,4.0 star rating,"Being a city slicker is all about multitasking and efficiency.  As someone who works in the food industry here, it's all about speed, speed, but without compensating quality. Yes, we are tough on ourselves, hence the proliferating healthcare. Juggling between two jobs is the norm.  The lack of full-time employment opportunity (companies skimping on benefits) and low salary, a city dweller can't function and survive on one employment anymore. Hence, eating on the run has become an art. What's that? Well, mainly handheld food items! While Wafels & Dinges isn't exactly an economical meal, one waffle plus topping is definitely fulfilling enough to consider one.  Aside from the calorie count, the wafel is conveniently plated on a folded container, much like a pizza, but more elegant and a sturdier hold.  While you can still go the proper method and eat with a fork and knife, one wouldn't be judged if you like slip the slice into your mouth.  No judgement when it comes to 'street' food.  The Belgium wafel isn't your typical frozen section kind.  Of course, it's freshly made on an iron waffle maker, under the expert hand of baristas.  As batter is poured, you could hear the exciting sizzle as the sugar, butter, dairy, and flour join in true matrimony.  Two more pass, out comes a perfectly formed wafel, ready to be dressed with your choice of toppings.  Speculoos (cookie butter) is their signature spread, so I went with that along with walnuts (as I saw that as an expensive condiment, rather than banana and strawberries).  Sure, it's brown, on brown, on well, more brown, with just a sprinkle of powdered sugar, the appearance isn't a colourful looker, but as we should never judge a book by its cover, eating it was just pure bliss.  While you could, of course, go with other routes, such as a la mode, nutella, or even savory versions, being a traditionalist has its own reward and that is guaranteed goodness.And oh, I ate that free because I drew an amateurish picture for their Wafel Day celebration. Once a year. I can justify that indulgence.Just one small complaint is that Wafel Day is only valid noon-6 and not the entire day.

Currently they have two full sized trucks and a few of the smaller carts serving up a smaller version of the full menu. They have two different types of waffles ($5), each comes with one free topping (dinge), a second is $1 and unlimited is only $2. The first kind is the brussels which is the normal light and crispy type of belgium waffle you're familiar with. The second is my personal favorite that I get every time, the liege. It's a more dense soft and chewy waffle. They have 10 different toppings, all of which are pretty standard, but the one that stands out is the spekuloos spread. This spread has the consistency of nutella, looks like peanut butter, and tastes like teddy grahams. Luckily they also sell jars of this crack spread which is now my ultimate favorite. The waffles are always served hot and fresh and from someone friendly. If you're going to one of the full sized trucks they also offer a few savory options including a pulled pork topped wafel and a wafel with baked in bacon. I've tried the pulled pork which is topped with slaw and a cool-ickle (a pickle made with coolaid). It was pretty good for a waffle truck but I would be very disappointed if I got that pulled pork at a BBQ restaurant.

The first topping (called ""dinges"") was free, and a second topping was $1, but you could get unlimited toppings for $2. We chose ""de bom"" waffle with strawberries, bananas, and ice cream.As I was getting my utensils, the waffles were ready in about 3 minutes.  The whole thing was DIVINE.

I will never go back to nutella again! They sell jars of spekuloos at the trucks and you can also buy them at their brick and mortar cafe.

Thankfully, Wafels & Dinges is leading the resurgence of high-quality waffles, and I couldn't be happier.I've heard much hype about these trucks and didn't think I'd run into one during my short stay in NYC. Alas, after failed attempt of getting into a secret bar, I saw the truck out in the distance and quickly ran over. Best sober decision of the night.I went the simple route and got a Liege waffle with strawberries. Upon first bite, BOOM. MIND. BLOWN. Soft on the inside, a bit crispy on the outside, chewy, and not too sweet. The strawberries add a nice fresh contrast to it and the light sprinkle of powdered sugar just kills any potential competition. It's pricey, but cheap quality doesn't exist. Add a little extra since it's NYC. I'd take a $5 waffle from them over a 20 pack of frozen waffles for the same price any day. I ate waffles at least twice a day when I visited Belgium.

GET THIS!), which was soft, chewy, and so fragrant!  The waffle was just slightly crispy, but mostly soft and just perfectly sweet. It was $5, which I think is absurdly expensive for ONE piece of waffle but absolutely worth every penny! The first topping is free, and each additional topping is $1.  I tried the liege waffle with strawberries and some powdered sugar, and it was SUPERB.  Cooling fruit on hot, chewy, sweet doughy goodness!AND, you can get more additional free toppings aka ""dinges"" if you follow them on Twitter and do cute things like ""use the word 'bubble' in a sentence"" or give them a secret password.  It's well worth it. AND, the guys working this truck are SUPER charming, nice, and friendly.  So, in conclusion:  Delicious Waffles + Sweet toppings + Cute Twitter tricks + Friendly waffle guys = YUM-O!  If you live in NYC, you have no excuse to not try this out if you haven't already!  Heh, even this non-dessert fan has been converted!  Too bad I live in San Francisco, all the way on the other side of the country, away from this delightful and tempting truck.  Curses!",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I've been to several of their carts, dragged several tones of friends, became addicted, gotten others addicted, and yet not felt guilty about it. With wonderfully friendly service, and accessible and unassuming food, I'm not even slightly surprised that they won the #1 Food Cart in the US. For as low as a cool 6$, you can make a full meal out of it. The usual grudge against desserts (from non-sweet-tooth-people) is that it gets too sweet to upgrade to an earlier meal course. This wafel, fear not, is a lasting sweet treat. And if you do become an addict like me, hit their blog. It makes for a humorous and entertaining read.What's cool is that they accept credit-cards, which for a food truck, is super helpful!Specific menu recommends: Once I figured out what works for me, I've never changed and here it goes - hit their WMD (Wafel of Mass Destruction).My Dear WMD = wafel + ice cream + strawberries + banana + walnuts + (rasp)berries + chocolate fudge = drool-worthy yummmm!!

Alas, we mere mortals may never know the answers. All we know is that the Wafel Gods have ordained it to be so, and it was good.When at Wafels and Dinges, always go for the WMD. For just $2 (that's a mere 1.46 Euros!), you can load your waffle with all the strawberries, bananas, fudge, Nutella, whipped cream and, yes, spekuloos spread that your heart desires. You have a choice of a couple of different waffle types, but I generally stick to the classic Brussels waffle. After all, the EU chose Brussels as it's capital for their waffles, didn't they?With half a dozen or so trucks and carts roaming about Manhattan, you're never too far from your next waffle fix.

347,K_y180_Uie0SBDOQTMPCoQ,Wing L.,4.0 star rating,"Wafles & Dinges had a small following before their famous show down with Bobby Flay for his show ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay"" on the Food Network.  Since then, after they won, they had only grown in more and more popular over the years.Starting with one roaming truck, their business grew and they added more and satellite little carts to help with the demand of their waffles.  Nowadays, you could find them daily for sure in two permanent locations in Central Park (soon to be a third), and a permanent spot in front of the Time Warner building. Besides the aforementioned original roaming truck, they also have a bigger version of their food carts which they dubbed the ""Goesting"" cart""  stating on their website ""While the Goesting cart is not really a truck, it thinks it's a truck and it acts like a truck. It visits a different location every day, just like the first Wafels & Dinges truck.""Although they all have their delicious sweet wafles made piping hot to order, I would recommend that all newcomers hunting down Wafels & Dinges for their initial taste go after the truck itself if they could.  The reason?  They have a slightly broader menu than their cart counterparts.Besides the sweet wafels that all locations carry, the truck also have savory wafels such as the ""BBQ Pulled Pork Wafel"" and ""de Bacon Syrup Wafel.""  Having patronized this this truck multiple times over the last year, whenever I wanted something more substantial than just their sweet stuff as a snack, I always ended up asking for the pulled pork.  It's basically their  regular liege or brussels wafles (your choice) topped with a ice cream scoop amount of delicious pulled pork on one end and a scoop of cole slaw with a slice of pickle on top at the other end.  I can't say anything about the bacon syrup because I could never get away from the pulled pork option whenever I'm ordering.Talking about ice cream scoops, last I checked, the truck was also the only location that you could get your order to be topped with a scoop of ice cream at a additional cost of $2.  So what sweet toppings should you order for your wafles?  Why even bother choosing?  Just pay $2 more for the WMD (Wafles of mass destruction) on the top of the price of the wafle and go to town on it with all of the toppings listed under the sweet menu.  No matter what though, do at least add the spekaloos spread that they are also famous for.I highly recommend that you eat the order piping hot nearby if you can but if you must take it to go, make sure that they are aware that you are not planning to eat it right away so that they could separate the wafles from certain toppings and place them on the side for you.  Trust me on this.  This is from a sad personal experience where I took my order to go and both my former crispy sweet and savory wafles ended up a soggy disgusting mess from the moist toppings after an hour of travel time.For drinks, the iced coffee and the ice tea were good, the hot Belgian cocoa was better, and the hot apple cider was nowhere to be found in the summer because it was off season.  Wait... they do sell apples in the summer so why can't they make cider?.... Hmmm...P.S.  Spelling it wafles for this review instead of waffles is driving me crazy.  I have to correct myself practically every single time.Pulled Pork Wafle:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xJSH3EM1­iZtOh4WZti4qjg?select=RfrFRzLI7IkAk9np3K3neQWMD with a scoop of ice cream: yelp.com/biz_photos/xJSH…",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Should I go crazy by topping my wafel with spekuloos, nutella, strawberries, bananas, Belgian chocolate fudge, and dulce de leche? It is only $2 for unlimited dinges so why not?

Like a reluctant kid, I tried to keep it as simple as I could.I'll take one liege wafel with spekuloos, strawberries, bananas and vanilla ice cream please!The first bite hit me with this amazing flavor and texture. The wafel itself was soft and chewy with a surprise of caramelized chewy chunks created by the pearl sugar pieces. The spekuloos spread lent itself very well with its gingerbread cinnamon cookie flavor. Another way to describe spekuloos is that it tastes like the Teddy Grahams snack but in a peanut butter consistency. The strawberries added freshness while the bananas made the wafel even more filling. Finally, the rich vanilla ice cream helped round out all the flavors. If it wasn't for the bananas, I may have been tempted to order another with a different combination of dinges.The truth has been revealed and my eyes have opened up to what a real Belgian Wafle is.

Once I tried the spekuloos spread, I knew I had to order the Throwdown Wafel, which was the creation Wafels & Dinges made that won them the competition against Bobby Flay in his show. The Throwdown Wafel is a freshly made waffle that is topped with spekuloos spread and whipped cream.We were served our hot waffle and found a place nearby to sit and enjoy. Again, we had to collect ourselves and eventually get past taking pictures of the waffle from every possible angle and start eating. The first bite was outstanding. The waffle was hot and had a soft inside and the spekuloos spread created a sugary-glaze that began to drip down into the waffle and the fresh whipped cream added some extra richness to each bite. It was a perfect combination that felt much more like a dessert than any sort of waffle you might have at breakfast. When I finished the waffle, I was actually a little sad and contemplated ordering another one because it was so good but I knew I was for a weekend of eating and I needed to pace myself.However, a ""wafel"" from Wafels & Dinges was the perfect way to start the weekend. It cost $6 and served as proof that you can get great food in New York City without having to spend a ton of money to do it. And it's a reminder that sometimes the best food isn't always served in the traditional kitchen.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"
375,r24XtUtPccNiLBXMtiWPfA,Michael W.,5.0 star rating,"You say you like waffles? How about soem Belgian waffles, but on a whole another level? Wafles & Dinges has numerous locations around the city. There is one at Central Park, but the one that I normally go to is at Columbus Circle, right in front of the shops. This place is a cart, but don't let that fool you. Wafles & Dinges tosses out some amazing treats that will make you keep coming back from home. This place is so deadly that I've had it after hitting the gym, and even before a morning run at Central Park. There has never been such a love/hate relationship, but I love it.For starters, a dinge is a topping. That means that you get 1 free topping on your waffle and any additional one is $1. If you don't have a huge sweet tooth, then the mini waffle is $3. I got it once, and its damn damn small. Fork up the extra $2, and you get a full sized waffle and topping. With toppings, you have more than 10 to choose from: Nutella, banana, butter, Dulce de Leche, and more. You say that you can't make up your mind, then go with one of their specialty waffles, and you can leave the topping selection up to the pros. If you really don't like waffles, then you can opt for the ice cream. Not sure how that tastes, but I'm sure it tastes as what you would expect ice cream to taste. But why would you NOT want a waffle anyway?Wafels & Dinges is open pretty much the whole day. Whether or not you're live here or are just visiting, you have to make a stop at Wafels & Dinges.

There was no way you'd be able to pick it up and eat it like a real ice cream sandwich, but with spoon in hand, I definitely tried. The gingerbread ice cream made the sandwich. It was probably some of the best ice cream ever and I would go back just for the ice cream alone.

So I stopped looking for it. And you know what they say...things happen when you least expect it. My friend and I had lunch together near Columbia's main campus and we were leisurely walking down Broadway when I spotted the unmistakable yellow food truck. We were both already full from lunch, but I coerced my friend to dart across the street with me to engage in this hedonistic and gluttonous activity. And boy are we going to Hell...We decided to share a wafel and she let me decide on the wafel.  This was a huge task for me. I am really indecisive. And when it comes to desserts, I turn into the human garbage disposal. I want to put everything in and churn. But alas, my friend had to knock some sense into me. We decided on the Throwdown wafel. A Throwdown wafel is a warm, buttery wafel topped with Spekuloos spread, and whipped cream. We had the guy cut it in and half and then devoured our portions. It was blissful and sinful. The Spekuloos spread has the flavor of gingerbread cookies and has the consistency similar to Nutella. I can just imagine all the fun things I can do with the spread. They now sell it for $7. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a damn good wafel but for $6 it was a bit steep.

Along with the incredible experience of being able to live in a foreign country for a bit and experience a ""Belgian life"" (albeit a fairly upper class one), it reinforced in me that I should stay in school and never get pregnant accidentally.Every morning I would drop off the children at their school and then I had some hours free until I had to pick them up in the afternoon. I would usually hop on a streetcar and go to the Grand Place in Brussels, which in my opinion is the prettiest city square in the world. I'll never forget the first night when I saw it with the lights and marveling at how people got to live here and see this every night. Along with the cultural wonders of the Grand Place (museums, concerts, etc), there were little waffle stands that sold Bruxelles and Liege gaufres (Belgian and Liege waffles). Waffles are a part of the national identity in Belgium and pretty much every major city in Belgium has their own version of the waffle. Before I ate my first Liege gaufre, like the French macaron, I liked the idea of waffles more than I actually liked the actual product. I don't know. I would order them because they looked delicious, but usually I was rather unhappy and disappointed -- soggy, doughy, too dry, burnt, whatever. The waffle never tasted the way I thought they should taste. This all changed with the first bite of a Liege gaufre. A beautifully crispy exterior, but a soft and yet slightly chewy interior that wasn't at all doughy or tough, and the little nuggets of carmelized sugar embedded throughout the waffle. The crispness of the waffle with the smooth velvety and slightly tangy taste of the creme fraiche was sheer culinary joy. Finally! This waffle was what I was looking for! I pretty much ate one every day, justifying my indulgence with the reason that when I left who knew how long it would be until I could have it again.After I left Belgium, I wasn't able to have Liege gaufres until Goed Eten came along in Toronto (which is now sadly closed). Wafels & Dinges are the closest to the perfect gaufres that I experienced in Brussels. The Liege waffles are usually very good, rarely perfect, as they're usually on the tad doughy side for me, and the exterior could be crispier, but until I get back to Belgium, they satisfy my desire for the Liege gaufre. The spekuloos (a cinnamon gingerbread-y Nutella-like spread) is ridiculously good. Insane!

414,siG24V4736E7GKi9jjLhng,Audrey C.,5.0 star rating,"It's been 7 months since my last visit to NY and I still crave Wafels & Dinges weekly. The Travel Channel featured them on one of their shows as the nations #1 food truck to try and I knew I had to try it the moment I landed in NY. Stayed in NY for a week and I think I had a waffle 5 out of 7 days during my vacation. Wafels & Dinges is hands down, the best dessert food truck out there. The Good:- Fresh made waffles!- Free dinges if you answer their daily question that they post via Twitter- 2 yummy waffles to pick from: a soft & chewy one (called de Liege I think) and the more common Belgian one we all know and love- Dinges (toppings) are always generously topped- Lots of dinges to pick from: ice cream. Nuttella, fruit, whipped cream, spekuloos- For those who don't have a big sweet tooth, they also sell waffles with savory toppings such as pulled pork with BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Everyone wins!- For all you cookie butter lovers, they have the best spekuloos topping you'll ever tasteThe Bad: - Most of the trucks - except the Momma truck (I think) - don't sell each kind of waffle- No West coast locations :(Tips:- Be sure to follow them on Twitter to get updates on their hours and locations. They vary from time to time- Remember that not all trucks sell each waffle, so make sure you're headed to the truck that has your favorite one (even though ALL of them are delicious)",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

The thing that knocked my socks off and haunts my dream (in a good way, I think), is the waffle with nutella, whipped cream and gingerbread icecream.

We got the Brussels Wafel ($5) which is a lighter and crispier kind of waffle.  The other style they offer is the ""Liege wafel"" which is more soft and chewy.  They come with different ""dinges"" which are basically toppings and the first one is free!  Of course we had to go with their infamous Spekuloo topping on top with a hint of powdered sugar.  The brussels wafel was freshly made and the workers on the truck were so nice to even take a picture for us.  My roomie and I busted out a fob squat and happily cut up our waffle on the ground.  Like true fatties, we were ready to grub and not let the cold get in the way of our food experience.   It was sweet, light, crispy, and heavenly.  The spekuloo is essentially gingerbread cookie in the spread texture of nutella or peanut butter.  It's like Christmas in a waffle with a hint of airy sinfulness.  It had the perfect consistency of crunchiness on the outside, and moist on the inside.

The waffles are Liege waffles made from dough, not a batter and they have little pockets of sugar mixed in. It is heaven! The throw-down waffle has their signature spekuloos spread and whipped cream. The spekuloos spread is unlike anything I have tasted before, smooth, almost peanut buttery but not, and sweet. It really is the perfect combination with the sweet waffle. My husband and I took the waffle back to the room and devoured it. I think we both wished that we had each gotten one instead of sharing, but we had a lot of other places we wanted to try that day so we saved room.

Maybe he owns the place.  He definitely had a charm- asking me about my day, we chatted about the weather, he gave me topic recommendations, talked around where the truck goes, etc. I came here on a whim, on a not so freezing winter day in Central Park.  I work nearby so on my routine lunch walk, decided I like waffles. Fuck the $10 salads.  Go for the $6 waffle.*  There was decent number of people surrounding the truck but no line :) I got the liege waffles (or ""wafels"") and two ""dinges"" (banana and nutella).  I suppose dinges is a Belgian word.  The waffle was the perfect size; medium and more rectangular, not round.  It was not huge like the traditional diner Belgian kind where you just feel so sick and nasty afterward.  Nice buttery waffle batter- it was crispy (but not burnt!!) around the edges, and soft and gooey in the middle. Nice and doughy too.  Yum. The worst is when waffles are burnt and hard, and this was nothing of the sort.   It was sprinkled on with powdered sugar.   I added on nutella and bananas.  They have different toppings, all priced at different levels. I think if it's anything like Nutella (which I loove), I'll have to try the acclaimed spkeuloos spread (although I'm scared I'm going to love it too much and it'll be like crack!)In any case, as it's been said- awesome snack or dessert for cheap.

Breakfast was going to be a liege waffle -- or nothing! I couldn't make it out to the actual truck, so I had to settle for the Vendetta cart that still sells the same waffles, situated permanently at 5 Ave. and 60th St. (near the entrance to the Central Park Zoo).The day was frigid, and I was looking forward to devouring a damn good liege waffle (a rarity, since many breakfast joints seem to think that oversized waffles = true belgian waffles). Boy oh boy, Wafels & Dinges sure does liege waffles justice! A slight crunch on the exterior, with a moist interior, speckled with a crystallized sugar. HEAVENLY. I chose to top mine with powdered sugar, nutella, and Spekuloos (this gingerbready peanut buttery weird spread that tastes AMAZING). If you're hesitant on the spread (as I was), ask for a taste. I bought a $7 bottle of that sucker. It was THAT good.So sad that I don't live in New York, but I will be sure to track down the truck whenever I return, and will be spreading the word to friends and family!

My eyes wandered around wildly as I glanced about me for the source. They focused in...on Wafels and Dinges.Now, last time, I tried Wafels and Dinges, I can't say that I was that impressed. I got the spekuloos and didn't care much for it. But, I figured this time, I'd get it with the Belgian chocolate and that'd would be the charm. After all, who can dislike chocolate?NOPE. I ordered my brussels with chocolate fudge and as I eagerly waited, I watched the cook try to pull out an undercooked wafel from the waffle iron and thought to myself, ""Some poor sucker is going to get that undercooked wafel."" Somehow, I ended up being that poor sucker. I didn't realize my wafel was undercooked until I took a bite and it was crispy on the outside with waffle batter on the inside. Not cool. Secondly, I don't know how, but somehow, some sort of orange citrus taste got mixed in my wafel. Did I mention that I'm not a fan of oranges and chocolate mixed together? First time, shame on me.

I should have tried them out right then and there, but silly me thought I'd be frugal that day. A few days later, I couldn't forget the sugary sweet wafel-ly aroma and I got it in my head that I'd want to have them at my wedding. The next mission was to actually try the wafels. Long story short, I've decided not to have them at my wedding for various reasons. (However, they are super responsive, helpful, and friendly if you contact them about catering for an event!) I think my experience is a classic case of starting off with super high expectations based on things you've heard from friends/reviews. I really wanted to be able to come away saying that I love them, but I gotta say that so far my experience has been just ok. I'm willing to give them a few more tries -- and maybe I need to try some of the trucks/carts in other locations?My first W&D experience was at 60th and 5th. I went for a liege wafel with speculoos and vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was great since it was a hot summer night, but the liege was on the heavy/dense side for me and it was slightly rubbery and tough. It tasted great...but the rubberiness threw me off a bit. 2nd experience also at 60th and 5th, but I only got the spekuloos ice cream. It was nice, but not spectacular. That being said, my ice cream standards are really high to begin with (I rarely deviate from my Jersey City-based Milk Sugar Love) so maybe take this with a grain of salt.If I try the Brussels style and am blown away, I'll update the review!

And I was 25. The waffle had a crisp brown exterior and soft interior. Just like the ones mom and I made last year. My friend didn't have a fork but she didn't want to wait to start eating the waffle, so she stuck her dirty fingers in and finished it before we got to our destination.

I ordered the liege waffle with spekuloos spread, which I've never tried before. The waffles were already made, but they put it back into the waffle iron and reheat it and then put the spread on with some powdered sugar. With one topping, it'll run you $7.The waffle could've been a crispier, but I guess it's not made to order, so that's the sacrifice. The inside though is fluffy and light. As for the spekuloos, I really enjoyed it. It basically is creamy peanut butter, without the punch of nutty flavor (though that could be a bad thing for peanut butter lovers). I liked it because it helped emphasize the main point of the dessert, the waffle. I've seen crepes just lathered and smothered with Nutella and toppings, which I find a disgrace to the actual crepe you are supposed to be tasting.If I ordered again, I would maybe ask them to go a bit lighter on the spread, but I'm glad they did not use a heavy hand on the topping. It didn't fill up every nook and cranny so much that the thing got soggy and destroyed the flavor of the waffle.I would look up the schedule of the truck, but on a Friday night, I saw it outside of NY Film Cafe near Cooper Union and St. Marks, though I've never seen it there.

My roommate at the time, Lena had won unlimited Wafels & Dinges for a month, so let's just say we became regulars... Wafels & Dinges has become one of the most well known New York City food trucks. It's bright yellow truck can be seen from a mile away and is a must try! They serve nothing but Belgian waffles, and they are doin' it right-- taking the dessert waffle to a whole new level.You can choose between the Brussels waffle, or the Liege waffle. The Brussels waffle is traditionally light and crispy. The Liege waffle-- soft and chewy. My favorite: The Liege waffle, with strawberries, bananas, fudge, their famous spekuloos spread with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Spekuloos are Belgian spice cookies, and Wafels & Dinges serve it at as a spread, which are the crushed cookies, whimsically transformed into the consistency of a hybrid of nutella and peanut butter. The spekuloos spread is what makes this waffle so special. Wafels and Dinges lovers adore the spekuloos spread so much, they now offer it as an ice cream. The fresh warm Liege waffle topped with ice cream, and the fresh, natural flavors from the berries and bananas compliment each other in a way that all desserts strive to. Great for sharing, Wafles and Dinges is sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Here are two problems.1) The waffle was pre-made and stacked high.2) The waffle was reheated on a griddle and even after reheated, it was lukewarm. The reheating was done using the hamburger frying method, which is flip and sear.The waffle ended up lukewarm and dry.

I made the mistake of picking the Throwndown Wafel, thinking that since it had won a competition, it had to be the best, and since I'm a sugar addict all the toppings sounded like the best idea.I was wrong. The best way to have these wafels is to let them speak for themselves. All I got was the liege wafel with whipped cream, and my friend just had it plain. We were both really impressed this time. The wafels have a really amazing flavor, and they're so sweet and crispy on the outside, but fluffy on the inside. The toppings just weigh it down and don't allow the best part to shine through, which clouded my first visit. I can't afford to visit too frequently, but I'll definitely be dropping by when the craving hits.

501,aablVTRZ8g0lNmuCccpnIw,Rosco D.,4.0 star rating,"Wafels & Dinges is great for a handful of reasons. I've had W&D about 8 times now... and every time, it's been a ""oh sh!t there's the waffle truck! (or sometimes... ""waffle cart!"").1.) They make DELICIOUS waffles. I've had the regular ""Brussels"" and the softer, chewier ""Liege"" waffles a bunch. As for the special ish, i've done the Throwdown (spekuloos and whipped cream); Bacon & Syrup (self-explanatory) at least twice each.2.) The Flay Factor. These dude's (or dude) beat Bobby Flay in the Throwdown. Not that it's tough to beat a guy that doesn't know ish about a waffle... but any loss for Flay is a win for me, so F it. 3.) Welcome Home Roscoe. I got home from a vacation to Hawaii... and I was not super fired up to be flying back to NYC. I love my home, but Hawaii is f'n amazing. Anywhooo... the Van Wyck was crazy backed up, and it was just one bullsh!t thing after another.... until i got off the shuttle. The yellow truck is sitting there. No line. One block away. I bought a Throwdown (what's up Flay?!?!), threw down the suitcase and ate the HELL out of that thing. I was instantly back in the groove. 4.) Top 10 Food Truck Memory: One afternoon I headed out to grab a Kimchi Bacon Fried Rice/Ribeye Steak burrito (my fave) from Korilla BBQ... I get there, and it was summer, so the line had about 50 peeps... 20 feet behind Korilla was Wafel & Dinge. Being the creature of opportunity that I am... I bought myself a nice Bacon waffle, then jumped in the Korilla line. Took my time eating the waffle, and swallowed my final bite about 30 seconds before starting my marinated beef burrito order! Can you say heaven? 4 out of 5 because sometimes the waffles take a while, and I always feel a little stupid trying to pronounce all their weird ish...

Our second attempt was much more successful, with no one waiting at the cart at 66th and Broadway one Sunday morning. The guy was super friendly (he was actually the one who had fed the hordes in Boston that day). Liege waffles are $5, with the first topping free. I got mine with the much-touted speculoos, even though I don't like super-sweet things. For the boy I wanted to suggest whipped cream, though only if it was real whipped cream not some Cool Whip substance, but it seemed too rude to ask so I just ordered it. Silly me. The cream was real, and the gooey speculoos to my delight had a deep caramel flavor that wasn't overly sugary.

506,JB7coorN1wXX5Ve5s1DYUA,Lena X.,5.0 star rating,"OH.MY.GOD.I've had literally every single fricken thing this truck serves. FOR FREE. Jealous? You should be.Anywho, they are all foodgasms. Let me share:Liege wafel:The ""soft, chewy one,"" they call it. True that, but its got just the slightest crunch sometimes at the edges or when you happen upon a particularly resilient sugar pearl in the batter. This wafel is dense enough to give some resistance when you bite--definitely not tough, but definitely not mushy either. I accidentally froze one this one time, and it was actually surprisingly delicious.Brussels wafel: Airy interior, a thin but decided crispness on the surfaces. Much closer to your traditional American waffle, but a zillion times better for a multitude of reasons that can only be summarized by stating that Belgians just trump Americans at food, period.Mini Wafelini: Basically a mini liege wafel on a skewer with banana and strawberry pieces. As the truckers say, ""for beaucoup cravings, petit hunger."" Tres mignon.BBQ Pulled Pork wafel:It's dericious, and it's exactly what it sounds like: pulled pork with bbq on your Brussels wafel. They actually keep the pulled pork separate from the bbq sauce in the truck, so you can actually adjust the flavor if you so wish. Comes with a side of coleslaw, best eaten on your wafel with the pork.Spekuloos: it's a spread the consistency of peanut butter. It tastes like buttery cookie crisps, except in spread form, with almost Christmasy spices like nutmeg and cinnamon and other spices contributing to the flavor. Spekuloos is originally a cookie anyway, but I digress. If you thought Nutella was sex in a jar (because there's a sizable Facebook group proclaiming such), then I guess this is just the longest mammal orgasm to ever be documented (oh and did you know that pigs have the longest orgasms of any mammal? Up to 15 minutes, kids). Wait, how did I start talking about pig orgasms in my review of a waffle truck?Verdekke Ice Cream Sandwich: Buttery wafel-y cookie crisps smeared with Nutella and whatever else you like, sandwiching ice cream. Quite delish, especially if you let the ice cream seep into the cookies just a little bit before you eat it! This also comes in cone form now, for ease of travel.And there's more but I think this covers the major. Favorite combo:Of course the WMD (Wafel of Massive Deliciousness--aka unlimited dinges, or toppings, $2) is wonderful because you can abuse your calorie limit all you want, but if I had to choose one flavor combo for a new friend who's only going to have this once in his/her life:Liege wafel with spekuloos, strawberries (I don't like bananas as toppings for anything), and tons of whipped cream. Topped with powdered sugar.Tips: I like my wafels crisp, crunchy, whatever they're supposed to be, so it kinda helps for me, especially when I get the Brussels to have my dinges on the side. That said, this is an annoying request so you should probably, as I usually end up doing, just eat it really fast (while remembering to savor) so it doesn't get mushy. Also, I always ask for extra whipped cream if I'm not getting ice cream with it--these are all very rich, rather dense flavors so it helps to have something more airy/cool to balance.Rauf and Azamat are my favs because I saw them the most this summer, but regardless, remember to drop a tip sometimes because these guys are insanely nice!",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

530,MKV4jibi14Wgs8e0XBSv6A,Nicole P.,5.0 star rating,"This was the year I first had a Wafel from Wafels & Dinges, also known as the Waffletruck. I had it a few months ago and from then on I was hooked. Once you try them, you will be hooked also and here is why.There are two main types of wafels: brussels & liege. I think the best way to describe each is to say brussels has more of a crunch and liege is more chewy. None the less, they are both quite delicious. There are quite an array of toppings, referred to as dinges, that you can have on your wafels. you can have fresh fruit, like strawberries & bananas. They even offer walnuts if you want a bit more crunch to your meal. But before we add the fruit and the nuts, there is one special topping we are missing. Some people prefer syrup on their wafels or powder sugar, which Wafels & Dinges does have. However when I was there, I discovered two alternatives. One was Nutella & the other Spekuloos. Nutella, that ""delicious hazelnut spread"". I have yet to try it with Nutella, but I plan to very soon. It looks quite tasty. Now the other spread I never heard of until visiting the truck. ""Spekuloos is a spread* that looks like peanut butter, but it tastes like traditional Belgian gingerbread-cinnamon cookies."" - Source: Wafels & Dinges siteSpekuloos is also delicious and addictive. Once you taste it, your taste buds will be in over drive. The flavor, is as some have said, ""orgasmic"". It gets better. You can buy a jar of Spekuloos to take home with you. I'm going to have to buy one the next time I stop by the Waffletruck.But you're wondering where do you find the Waffletruck, right? Well that's an easy answer. Follow them on Twitter @waffletruck or like their Facebook pages. Sometimes they even post a special promotion, where if you do some random act, you get a free dinges.Now I'm going to go back to eating my Liege  Wafel with spekuloos and strawberries. Mmmm.

I saw this on TV and I was amazed at the fact that someone had the balls to put all this unconventional things on top of an actual Belgian waffle! I tracked down this truck and decided to come to my own definitive conclusion. And that conclusion is this is the shit! This is really something special. The guy makes the waffles with precision. He is no joke. And the toppings are off the charts (literally). I went with the pulled pork and the one with the bacon built inside. Amazingly, the pulled pork one was awesome. Lots of flavor, super juicy, and the cole slaw actually made it all go together. The only down side to this escapade was that it is kind of messy. Oh well. You can take this for the team. Bring yourself some wet wipes or just use the fork! The bacon waffle was less messy because it was built into the waffle. That was the bomb also. I liked the pulled pork one better though.Who knew that a Belgian waffle can be this awesome??",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

538,GukXa0uVU9fxtXFYvFy4Ow,Katie C.,4.0 star rating,"My first year at NYU I did not bother to try this place. I would always see it Wednesday nights in Union Square, but I never tried it. Mainly because I was always heading to the gym when I spotted it and also because it was a bit pricey for a waffle. A small waffle in fact. So I never really noticed it. My friends mentioned it to me a couple times. Told me i HAD to try it. I never really did until recently. Me and my boyfriend were strolling through the Union Square holiday market and they had a booth. We were going to go to Max Brenners for dessert, but we couldn't help ourselves to the delicious smell of the waffles. We stared at the menu for a while, confused on what dinges were and how much everything costs and what we would be getting. So we just decided to fork up 7 dollars and get one waffle with everything on it. It's called WMD or weapons of mass destruction. As the guys were making it for us, they were explaining their ""special"" spread. Spekuloos. That spread is the most delicious thing in the world. Absolutely the best thing i ever tasted. Tops peanut butter, nutella, chocolate. EVERYTHING. It was so good. I could eat the whole jar. Anyway... So we got the waffle with everything atop. It was heavy might I add. We devoured it within minutes. It was so good. The waffle isn't like any waffle. It is a belgian waffle. It was sweet, warm and crunchy. It was so good. I never tasted anything like it. The only reason why this review doesn't get a 5 star rating it is because I'm not a great fan of the price. It's a truck... I mean, at least charge a few dollars less because we have no where to sit and eat... I mean if you open a restaurant, then sure charge 7 dollars. But come on... I would go broke if I got this once a week. I can't imagine how the NYU students who live in the dorm they park in front of resist getting this every wednesday... Well at least try it ONCE. Then you will come back for more if you like, depending if you're rich enough. Oh I also try their mini waffles on a skewer. They put a mini waffle on a skewer and add strawberries and bananas at the end. Me and boyfriend chose to get spekuloos spread instead of fudge on ours. It was an extra 50 cents, but it was worth it. Might I add it was a second time eating waffle and dinges at the cart in front of central park. To feel less guilty, it was the next day, didn't get it twice in one day.. heh.

They were so good that we ordered another one. Well, I had 2 out of the 3 that we ordered... and I made my sister to go back to the truck so the workers wouldn't think that I'm the wafel addict. The brussels wafel was so light and fluffy, it wasn't like any other waffles that i've ever had. The liege wafel was sweet and chewy, which was such an interesting alternative to regular waffles.

Little did they know I waited in line for an hour and a half just to get a taste of that sweet sweet wafel. But because I'm a lady I didn't want to get crazy with the dinges. Got to leave something for next time. But of course I wanted to get my time and monies worth so I ordered the bacon and the throwdown wafel. And like most things all that waiting and anticipation amounted to about 10 minutes of pleasure. I got my wafel. The size wasn't anything to be amazed at but as the saying goes 'good things come in small packages'. The flavor did not disappoint.  The bacon with the spekuloos spread and whipped cream just felt perfect together with the light crispy wafels, none of them over powering each other. In the back of my mind I knew I had to taste it again. This past weekend I stumbled upon them in Bryant Park. Unfortunately, I was told only the trucks carry the savory wafels. But the guy taking orders took the time to try and look up their closest truck for me since most things in Manhattan tend to be pretty close. He couldn't  find one but I did appreciate the effort so I left with a jar of their spekuloos spread. Until next time, your sweet dinges will be mine!

I was thinking about adding nutella on it but I knew it'd be too sweet after a few bites. The strawberries were a bit on the bland side but the whipped cream on that waffle was just right.

582,eaTNcJkvJmyMtgyiYW0_1g,Sharon L.,5.0 star rating,"BF and I were in Forest Hills this past weekend and imagine our surprise to find the Wafels & Dinges Food Truck parked right off of Austin St! We had been meaning to try their waffles after reading all the positive reviews and although we were stuffed from dinner, we had to make room for dessert!Like most waffle shops in Belgium, Wafels & Dinges offers two types of waffles-- Brussels waffles and Liège waffles. Brussels waffles are lighter and crispier and are rectangular and uniform in shape. The batter consists of an egg-white or yeast leavened batter which gives the waffle its light and crispy texture. The Liège waffle is practically the opposite of a Brussels waffle. It is softer and chewier and the the batter is actually a variation of brioche bread dough, hence its sweetness. Liege waffles also have bits of pearl sugar in the batter which caramelize on the outside of the waffle during cooking process.While we were perusing the menu, the people working the truck were extremely friendly and patiently answered all our questions. It was fun to watch the waffles being made and the different combinations of wafels & dinges that people ordered. Waffles are $5 and the 1st dinge is free, a 2nd dinge is $1 and unlimited dinges are a mere $2! The menu presents an assortment of combinations, including the famous Throwdown wafel (Brussels waffle w/ spekuloos spread & whipped cream) which beat out Bobby Flay of the Food Network. Spekuloos spread is a paste version of the popular spiced Belgian cookie. The main spices in the cookie are cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom and nutmeg. The resulting paste is more mild in flavor. There were also a few savory wafels to choose from, like the bacon + syrup wafel in which crunchy bacon bits are mixed right into the waffle batter! Add a swirl of sweet maple syrup and you have my favorite snack combo of sweet and salty. Although we were tempted, we knew that what we really wanted was a liège wafel with chocolate. Our liège wafel was served in a cleverly designed container and was every bit as good as the waffles we had when we were in Belgium. It was sweet without being too sweet and the slightly burnt bits of sugar add another dimension of flavor. The Belgian chocolate fudge that was drizzled on top was warm and made of high quality chocolate. The slight bitterness of the chocolate paired well with the rich, sweetness of the waffle. YUM! Next time I find myself craving a waffle from Belgium, I just have to get myself to Wafels & Dinges!Tip: For those who have not tried spekuloos spread before, it is NOT to be missed! And it's not just good on waffles, it's great with ice cream, on toast, and as a dip for pretzels. Trader Joe's sells their version of spekuloos spread called cookie butter for $3.99/jar.

Wellllll........okay, and I forked over my money.   I waited several minutes for the waffle to be heated, and, while I was waiting, I noticed a sign below eye level stating ""BREAKFAST SPECIAL: WAFFLE AND COFFEE $5"", till 11AM"".  Suddenly ravaged by a need for caffeine, I said "" Hey, wait a sec.   Give me the breakfast special."" And I waited.      The guy looked at me- still sullen, but now smug and annoyingly pleased with himself- and said, ""It's 11:02.""  I looked at him and said, ""You cannot be serious.""   Point of fact, though, he was.       So- here we have a customer service oriented business unwilling to throw in a cup of coffee, and on of all days, Christmas Day.   What a distasteful and unpleasant experience to have just because of one sullen employee.   I carried the waffle home to my SO, and he ate it, unaware of the unpleasant sales experience I had just had. If business is so good for this company that they can afford to be so deeply ungracious at holiday time- or any other time, for that matter- then good luck to them, they certainly don't need my business.   You couldn't pay me enough to patronize this business in any way, shape, or form ever again.  In the interests of full disclosure, I broke off a tiny piece of the waffle before I offered it to my SO, and frankly, it was pretty meh- entirely forgettable.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I'd eat here all the time if it weren't so unhealthy...heh. One waffle was enough to keep me satisfied for quite a while!I tried it again later with a scoop of ice cream (a very generous scoop!) and it was basically the best thing ever.

I looked them up online and saw that they had changed their location and were hanging out down on Broadway in Astoria on Sundays. WHAT?!?

Because of her friendliness and the popularity of these Waffles we both decided to tried one each. So you place your order with the girl at the front. She writes your name and what wafel you like and how many dinges (things) you would like to add on. First one is free. Unlimited is just $2. You could pay in cash or credit. They prefer cash.Then you wait on the side until they call out your name. You could eat it right there or box for later. I recommend eating it fresh. I got the brussel Wafel with spekuloos spread which also comes with a little powder sugar. Hubby got the liege Wafel with vanilla ice-cream and belgian chocolate fudge.Both tasted amazing especially when you get it fresh.

This instinct is so bad that have confused the similarly yellow L'Occitane stores as Wafel carts from a distance.

But illuminated by a friend to its wonders I always get a WMD (+$2)-- Wafel of Mass Deliciousness. I mean its just a extra dollar more for unlimited dinges.My order:Spekuloos, Chocolate Fudge, Whipped Cream, Bananas and Strawberry.Sometimes I add their ice cream (+$2). They have vanilla as well as spekuloos. I've even had Hoegaarden ice cream.I've been trying to avoid the trucks and carts recently, but only because they are a diet-buster.

Is that what makes them so great? So while my waffle was reheating in the waffle iron,  I saw the guy going back and forth to the microwave.  A microwave on a food truck? WTF  Does no one watch ""Kitchen Nightmares"" to know a microwave does not belong in a commercial culinary kitchen? It's the kiss of death.I spoke up and said ""I don't want the waffle any more.  I don't want anything microwaved.""  ""It's the gravy,"" he said. ""We make it fresh and then reheat.""

People love their wafels & dinges so I had to wait a bit.  The good thing was that I got a fresh, hot wafel. Yes, they make them fresh in the truck!  So I waited patiently for my wafel, entertained by jars of Spekuloos.  (By the way, have you had spekuloos before? It is diviiine!  It tastes like creamy, cinamonny, gingerbready goodness.  I recently picked up some faboo spekuloos cookies in the Amsterdam airport.  Twice.  Anyone got a spekuloos cookie connection and want to hook me up?)Aaaanyway, I finally get my hot little hands on my throwdown wafel and it. is. awesome!  The wafel is hot, chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside and not-too-sweet.  The whipped cream is a light and easy complement to the rich, creamy spekuloos spread.  I almost went back for a second, but I showed restraint (after eating Japanese food.

Drowned with a cup of belgian hot chocolate, which by the way is everything you ever dreamed of. Times 10. Now I often settle for the mini wafelinis, which are tiny as a dot and make no economic sense whatsoever but serve the purpose when you're not hungry but just greedy for a waffle.I love that they often have daily specials on toppings. In summer, watch out for the spekuloos ice cream. If you're one of those who love the flavour but don't like the texture of spekuloos as much, this ice cream will make you swoon. It will also make you fat, don't say you weren't warned.My favourite is the spekuloos spread, chopped fruit and whipped cream on a dense, chewy, hot liege waffle which is deliciously caramelized and crisp on the edges. I'm getting one tonight. Meet me there!Also especially awesome -- the cheerful Wafels and Dinges staff.

My girlfriend and I had just had lunch and were walking around the Union Square Christmas Market, where she spotted their booth. However, I wasn't hungry and she didn't want to eat alone, so we didn't get any and proceeded to walk the entire market, then walk to Bryant Park for ice skating and then walk to the Lincoln Square cinema on Broadway & 68th to see Avatar with one of my friends. We all had dinner after the movie, but by that point, she was sick with a fever and other pestilences, all of which became my fault, since I wouldn't eat Wafels & Dinges with her.Over the years, Wafels & Dinges has become a joke - ""Hey, it's that place I wasn't hungry for, so you got sick!"" However, in all those years, we've never actually eaten anything from them, until last weekend...We'd just finished ice skating at Bryant Park and while leaving the park, just happened to pass by their shop. Despite the fact that I was still pretty stuffed from Ippudo, we decided to split a waffle, with strawberries on top.While I was watching the dough being placed on the waffle iron, I couldn't help but notice its texture and consistency. Then, when the waffle iron was lifted up, the dough stretched between the two halves of the waffle iron, but never broke apart and always ended up on the top half of the iron. Just watching the way the dough behaved as it was placed on and taken off the waffle iron was a hint that we were in for something delicious.After taking the first bite, all I can say is wow... there's definitely a secret ingredient in this dough. Combined with the strawberries on top, prepare for an out of body experience. Wafels & Dinges is like no waffle you've ever had.

It was a good choice.) There are also savoury wafels but since I've only been twice I haven't been able to pass up on spekuloos (I topped a liege wafel with spekuloos ice cream and fresh bananas my second time there).If you're in the city, follow them on Facebook to track them down.

I devoured my waffle in about 20 seconds and asked for another one. They have lots of different types of waffles and toppings so mixing it up is a lot of fun. Their Belgian waffle is their most popular but everything on the menu is a win. You order which waffle you want and you add your toppings or ""dinges"" to it.

Which is understandable because this 1 guy is doing it all - ripping apart handfuls of dough, setting the timer, cutting the strawberries, pouring the coffee, scooping the ice cream.. and chatting you up with that twinkle in his eye.  But of course, all I'm thinking is : hurry up hurry up hurry up thanks.Grab a fork (and knife, for sure) and a seat and enjoy!$5 for a plain waffle, $2 more for ice cream, regular toppings are $1.The powdered sugar is free though haha yum!",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

Weary after a long day and a hard month, he swings by Bryant Park for a pick me up. After passing craft makers, ice skaters and cider swiggers, he makes his way to the northwest corner of the park and suddenly has a nosegasm. This smell - his white whale, his holy grail, his Rosebud - had to be found.Around the corner, in a small booth, were a husband and wife team making oddly shaped waffles. There were no takers - who pays $5 for an Eggo? But, our hero was up for anything on that cold day. Money was exchanged, and before anyone knew it, the greatest odyssey of our time had begun.He ate the first one in 15 seconds. He immediately bought a second one, this time bathed in gallons of succulent nutella. He thanked Sonya and John and made a promise to come back. A food promise is always kept.He went back every day. EVERY day. With a friend. With a date. With his entire office. With strangers. He was so reliable a draw that they refused to keep taking his money. Amateurs. He convinced Sonya to sell him wholesale boxes instead. Unbeknownst to his roommate, their freezer was about to be emptied. Chicken patties and frozen pasta are of no consequence when one has 116 waffles needing a home.Christmas and the New Year came and went, and just like that, the waffles were gone. They came back the following winter, of course, but after another great run, the Bryant Park stand shut down. Evan R. got a new job, joined an African tribe for awhile, and drank a lot in various places. But nothing could fill the void. It became too painful to even mention Bryant Park again.Three years later, he sees a blog post. About ""wafels."" In a truck. He was dismissive and contemptuous, knowing that he had tasted the one true waffle. However, a friend thought it looked cool, so off to the cart they went...I cried that day. I cried the tears of finding a long lost love. I can live with all the fancy new stuff. Dinges are fun. Spekuloos is like crack. It's neat following the truck on Twitter.

I've always had a soft spot for Belgian waffles in my heart/stomach-fat but Wafels & Dinges beats any kind of waffle I've had. My love affair with this truck began last year when they came on campus and gave out free (!) wafels...then they came back this year and began charging. I guess they figured out they were still just as popular. Damnit.The truck has two waffles:Brussels Wafel and the Liege Wafel. There's also a Mini-Wafelini (but don't be a pussy). The Brussels wafel is lighter, crispier so I tend to prefer the Liege Wafel which is just a lot moister in my opinion. I suggest going simple (1-2 toppings...they charge after the first couple of toppings anyway) otherwise your waffle is going to drown under the huge ice cream scoop/nutella/heaven they dump on your paper plate . Is it worth the 5$? Is your happiness worth 5$? If so, run to the truck when you see it.Menupages says they sell Wafel-bibs.

When I tried their street cart for the very first time in February 2011, I just was not impressed AT ALL! I guess they've gotten better since then (either that or my taste buds must have deteriorated). They've also gotten a good deal friendlier, which is one of the reasons I want to justify those 4 stars I'm giving them. I am not a regular but whenever I see them around (Union Square Holiday Market or Madison Square Garden), I certainly have the urge to snag one of their waffles. With hot Belgian fudge that can freeze if you don't eat it right away during those cold winter months. Once I even had their Allesdinges with chocolate fudge, strawberries, bananas, powdered sugar, and whipped cream. Mhmmm! Sugar shock times two. But so good!

The spread had a nice gingerbread-like taste to it and it wasn't overwhelming despite there seeming to be a lot of it on my waffle. The waffle itself was pretty good and not too heavy. The size of it was just right for a snack. If you went for more bells and whistles, maybe you could make a small meal out of it.But while I'd say my experience at Wafels & Dinges was positive, I just can't give it a 5-star rating. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. I'm glad I gave it a try. I just wasn't overwhelmed with excitement afterwards and I don't think I'd go out of my way to go there again in the near future.

The truck sells it for $7 and it goes well with EVERYTHING. Buy a jar, spread it on a crepe with some fruit, and you'll instantly become a more well liked person.

Actually, now that I think about it... $7 isn't really that bad for a waffle... I think they aren't priced much less at IHOP. The staff was also very friendly.

And Wafels & Dinges is probably my favorite one of all.I've been a fan of these guys for over a year, and they never disappoint. The deal is: they make a delicious Belgian waffle for you right there, and top it with whatever you want: fruit, ice cream, wet toppings like chocolate or Nutella, and often some kind of yummy seasonal thing. They typically make two kinds of waffles - one is the classic Belgian waffle, which is rectangular and a bit crunchy; the other is the Liege, which is a bit sweeter and chewy. Neither one is a bad choice. I've had both. They're warm and delicious; the only difference to me is how easy they are to cut. (Hint: this is a messy enterprise. You should get your waffle in a box and find a table somewhere.)The best part about W&D is how much they've expanded. They used to just have their truck, which (unsurprisingly) wasn't up in my neighborhood in Upper Manhattan NEARLY enough. But now you can track down the truck, as well as stop by any of their little carts in Central Park and Columbus Circle that are permanently stationed.

My theory is that, while most people need to track this little yellow truck down, it tracks me down. It seems as though everywhere I turn, I see the little yellow truck. The first time it happened was last spring at fulton fish market.  It was there our (at the time) 5 year old dropped her dinge, and the sweet guy in the window happily offered her another, without us even asking. Now that's customer service!! Unfortunately, it was also there where the little yellow truck decided to become MY biggest fan.  I try to ignore it, but every time I see the little yellow truck (and realize it's once again tracked me down) I acquiesce and end up stuffing my face with one of the many epicurean delights offered.  Only to spend the next two hours in a spin class or running down the west side highway in effort to undo the damage to my ass the spekuloos has done.  What I love?    - liege (the other belgian wafle)  - de throwdown wafle - just thinking about it makes me shake  - wafle ice cream sandwich - perfect balance of sweet, creamy chewiness  - mini wafelini (great for taking home and saving for later!!!)  - My favorite toppings are bananas, strawberries, nutella and of course spekuloos.

732,og3ItQKKLqUGGhXdsDjU0w,Ravi J.,3.0 star rating,"Wafels & Dinges is more of a gourmet snack truck than a food truck.Scratching my head after gorging on an $8.50 Belgian waffel with pulled pork and slaw, I wondered: who on earth came up with this combo? Whew knew rich swine meat bathed in tangy BBQ sauce could pair so well with a buttery crisp Belgian waffel? And finally: how on earth did I agree to pay $8.50 for such a small portion?You see, Wafels & Dinges is a mixed bag. It's a gourmet foodtruck; and with gourmet comes a hefty price tag. For a Midtown lunch treat, it's a hard sell. I was still hungry after my artisan portion of pulled pork-on-a-wafel. Particularly since $8.50 can buy a lot more food in this culinary wasteland. Wafels & Dinges as an afterdinner treat? Now that's a different story.

All I should say is that I am so glad I sought after the Wafels & Dinges truck even though I wanted nothing more than to sit in front of a heater in my apartment. Oh, but after trying W&D... 18 DEGREES OUT? NO BIG DEAL--I was consumed by W&D's waffles. But I NEED to explain further how much I love W&D:First of all, their Spekuloos spread is amazing.  Although the guys making your waffles won't tell you what it's exactly made out of, the spread is a bit spicy, a bit creamy, and tastes like gingerbread cinnamon. Eating the crispy and doughy waffles with spread reminiscent of gingerbread cookies brought me back to a state of nostalgia and holiday cheer... think Antono Ego from ""Ratatouille"" when he had that bowl of ratatouille.  Love at first bite? Definitely.Okay, W&D is where you go for liege waffles. HOLY MOLY. These wonderful creations are on point--they're crispy, doughy, slightly sweet, and, in general, perfect. W&D uses Belgian pearl sugar, a refined sugar, to sweeten the liege waffles, which gives it its crunchy outer layer.Their ""Dinges"" are toppings. You can choose from toppings like strawberries, bananas, Nutella, whipped cream, maple syrup, Spekuloos spread, etc. I opted for the liege wafel + strawberries + banana + maple syrup for the first waffle and then liege wafel + strawberries + Spekuloos + maple syrup for my second serving. Both A-MA-ZING.I did try their Bacon Syrup Wafel but wasn't really a fan. I was  overwhelmed by the syrup.If you're in New York, you need to get on this W&D craze!

If you ever see a big yellow Food truck, Run for it and get one of these.FOOD:We got a nutella covered belgian waffle and it was too die for. They made it fresh obviously but it tasted a little different from your regular waffle. Not over crunchy, yet moist and not too chewy either. It's probably some blend in their waffle mix. However, they executed perfectly and the nutella on top melted perfectly with it and had powdered sugar, a tiny bit of syrup among other things.SERVICE:Friendly, nice and when the person serving you has a great attitude, the food just tastes that much better if you know what I mean. However I was shocked when he asked for my name for the order and said shimmy instead of jimmy. And i said I know how to shimmy, and the crowd around me almost made me shimmy for my food but I talked them out of it. WHEW! LOL I need a beer or two before I do something like that in public haha.  ATMOSPHERE: Relaxed, Fun, on the streets. Great in person experience. Love the window in the back so you can see the cleanliness of the inside and what they are doing. Great touch to presentation in my opinion.  SUMMARY:Great dessert for night/late night or after any meal to be honest. Price can be a little too much for some but it's worth it.

Probably not.  Do I regret trying it? No way, it was worth the experience.  Overall, the Wafels & Dinges truck is a wonderful food truck with delicious treats and amazing service.  The guys from the truck are always very friendly and helpful.  I also highly suggest following them on twitter as they tweet a chance to get a free dinges every day.  I may have had to order like a valley girl, but I saved $1 so it was worth it!  So give it a try, you won't regret it.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I was having a craving for chili and low and behold Wafels & Dinges' special of the day was chili on a corn waffle. Can it get much better?Nope.The waffle tasted like fluffy cornbread, but of course waffle form. And the chili was heart-warming and flavorful. This was definitely worth the walk outside in the rain.In addition to my meal, and since I mentioned Belgian Restaurant Week, I received a free ""playground waffle."" What's that might you ask? Well, in the words of the guy who helped me, ""it's individually wrapped so that you can take it to the playground and eat it there."" Cute. This waffle was in the traditional liege style, slightly sweet, but definitely fluffy. It made for a great snack the next day. Too bad I wasn't at a playground. I could have gone for some swing-set action.I've heard wonderful things about their several varieties of sweet waffles, which you can load up with toppings (the dinges) from nutella to ice cream to their special spekuloos sauce.

I didn't even know this existed until I saw the bright, yellow truck parked right by our apartment building in Long Island City.The first experiences was with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream, and my recent experience was apparently the day's special. My husband ran out to get the waffles as soon as he spotted the truck from our apartment window (even guys are obsessed with the waffles--not just ladies!).  He didn't catch what it was called but apparently some person from Food Network made a comment on this particular one.  Toppings included: warm caramel, pineapples, and raspberry-flavored ice cream (YUM!). Although I am all about cheap, GOOD food, I can't help rave about Wafles and Dinges despite their incredibly expensive waffles with toppings (average is about $7 dollars and ""today's special"" is about $8)---it could be a price of a meal.  Trust me, once you taste it, you won't be able to go back!Side Note: There are other options to the types of waffles & sizes and varous other toppings (whipped cream, coffee, Nutella, etc.)--usually, their daily specials are off-the chart GREAT!

Of course you could go with the nutella and banana but save that for a crepe and get the Spekuloos Spread. Just take into consideration i am SUPER Italian and for me to suggest anything over getting nutella is absurd.

Sadly, the carts don't have savory items (I really wanted to try the Chilli con Corne) and had to ""settle"" for something sweet. The Throwdown wafel looked promising, billing itself as the dish that beat Bobby Flay on his TV show.Well, if this is what he was up against, poor Bobby never had a chance.The wafels are precooked--I almost took a star away for that--but the texture and moisture were still there after reheating. Plus, the wafel was just terrific by itself--chewy, flavorful and quite unlike any of the Belgian Waffles you get in a diner. While I would have liked the show of pouring a ladle of batter onto a sizzling waffle iron, the product was better than just about any other waffle I've had. (By the way, I'm waffling between their spelling, Wafel, and the Americanized Waffle).While the base was solid, what they put on it took this from a tasty item to something that could be a dangerous habit. Spekuloos is a spread of crushed spice biscuits (think gingerbread) that has the texture of peanut butter, but that description minimizes what is now going to be my replacement for Nutella as soon as I can get my hands on it. To the internet! Two shots of whipped cream and some shakes from a powdered sugar dispenser later and they sent me on my way.I fully intended to bring it back to my office to show off to colleagues but soon found myself standing in City Hall Park facing a tree and chowing down. I was helpless. Truthfully, I really wanted to pick the whole thing up and shove it in my mouth, but had a least a small bit of higher brain function left to rationalize that I wanted this to last as long as I could.OK, so now I have a new go-to comfort food.

More dense than your usual waffle.  The pearl sugar added an extra sweetness and layer of taste that was out of control.  The spekuloos spread was the star of the show.  Spekuloos is like a gingerbread/gram cracker spread.  Extremely smooth , similar to the texture of Nutella, except much easier to spread.  I loved the Spekuloos so much that I purchased 3 jars of it at the truck a few nights later.   Upon returning to Cali, I pretty much knocked out a jar a week.  It became my breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I'm thinking about buying more online.If I were to only have one dessert for the rest of my life.  This would be it.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

887,PiyAxsCNQnPufNLNE98eew,Lawrence C.,5.0 star rating,"For a period of time, the Wafels and Dinges truck parked literally in front of my apartment building on Fridays. I guess business wasn't great, since one week they didn't appear, and when it became clear that they wouldn't be coming back, I cried out to the heavens. ""Why didn't I patronize them more when they were right here? WHYYYYY!?!?!?!?"" I was so distraught that I didn't bother to check out where they were parking instead.So it was something of a shock to me to find out that on Tuesdays these days, they set up shop on 52nd St between Lex and 3rd, barely five blocks away. After the initial ""Why haven't I been checking their Twitter more often? WHYYYYY!?!?!?!?"" reaction, I ran over as soon as I could, excited and a little humbled that they hadn't abandoned Midtown East after all.When I got there, they were prepping wafels and dinges (toppings) for a couple of Rickshaw Dumpling Truck workers while discussing what dumplings they could get in return. (The Rickshaw guys were parked just a stone's throw away.) It was heartening to see such collegiality amongst food vendors, so often a cutthroat world.Then it was my turn. I puzzled over the offerings for a while. The Brussels wafel today, marvelously airy and light? Or the more substantial Liege wafel, a more solid bed for the heavier dinges like the strawberries or the vanilla ice cream? Then I saw something I'd forgotten they offered: the pulled-pork wafel. ""Pulled pork!"" I blurted out.It took a few minutes, during which the always chatty cooks kibitzed with me about my job. ""I'm on my vacation, and the first place I came was right here,"" I said. I got a smile for that, but it seemed like it was the sort of thing they'd heard a lot before. Of course they have.When it came, I was shocked by the size of the thing. On half of the Brussels wafel was piled juicy pulled pork, all BBQ-sauced up. It would have been a fine lunch by itself, but the other half was stacked with coleslaw and a slice of pickle. It called to mind a phrase they use elsewhere on their menu: it was a WMD, a ""Wafel of Massive Deliciousness.""Needless to say, it tasted awesome. On one hand you had the tenderness of the pork dovetailing  with the yielding crispness of the wafel underneath. On the other, you had that crispness overlaid with the more assertive crunch of the coleslaw. It was a glorious gutbomb.You can't *always* order such a thing, but there's not a clunker on the rest of the menu. Either the Brussels or the Liege is a lovely delivery vehicle for the various dinges, from dulce de leche to bananas to Nutella to the deservedly-highlighted ""spekuloos"" sweet spread. They have mini versions too.Whenever some curmudgeon bemoans the rise of the hipsterish mobile food vendor, Wafels and Dinges is exhibit A in my rebuttal. After all, between the menu flexibility, the warm service, and of course the actual food, Wafels and Dinges might just be my favorite of all the new-school food trucks. (...Though Cravings and Schnitzel & Things are both reallllllly good...)

It seems Americans just don't make them which is why I was so thrilled to see them here. Why is this waffle so special? It's the perfect balance of crunch and softness, the caramelized sugar outside adds a small crunch while the inside remains perfectly gooey and delicious! What's most amazing is that he actually gets the sugar imported from Belgium - you just can't replicate this kind of deliciousness! I urge you to go and when you try it for the first time, just get it with powdered sugar - you wouldn't want to ruin such a beautiful creation by drowning it in toppings.

I opted for the Nutela, strawberries, and whipped cream on mine and got a plain liege with a side of spekuloos ""for my friends.""

The toppings are pretty good, and can be applied in any combination you can think of. I highly recommend the spekeloos spread. I got the throwdown wafel and shared with a friend.

I'm not sure why Americans just don't embrace them like they should... I think we've been turned off by those supposed Belgian things at IHOP and Denny's, but these are the real deal. I had my first liege waffle in San Francisco at the Waffle Mania Truck and later in Spain found out they were called gofre (or gaufre). I had one everyday while I was in Spain. The liege waffle was a little more dense than is necessary. It's $5 but I would've been happy having a taste of their $3 mini-wafelini. The brussels waffle is the rectangular one that is less sweet but still delicious. Since I didn't top my liege waffle, I was able to get 2 toppings for the brussels. Dulce de leche dinges was too sweet even for me. It was too late but after ordering the 2 waffles, we saw there was a bacon and maple special.

The mere scent of nutella and strawbrerries triggers a Pavlovian response. It's an obsession that's not rational nor healthy. Sure, I've made my share of waffles at home and tasted a few at state fairs but, to explain following a 46 year old truck painted in the Belgian national colors, is truly odd but NY.I always come upon the vehicle with glee and excitement. Toiling at the waffle maker, the attendant asks me which waffle.... and before he completes his sentence, I retort, ""Liege with nutella, strawberries with a dollop of  whip cream"" Liege, by the way, is a waffle that's crispy on the outside but chewy within.

Crisp at the edges and ridges, chewy warm and delicious...a perfect winter day treat. I am definitely on the speculoos bandwagon. Rich, smooth, creamy, yum. A little bit like ginger thins, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and peanut better but better than the sum of its parts...whatever they happen to be. I'm not here to question, just to enjoy. Tiny bit of caramelization and powdered sugar here and there is probably not doing anything good for my waistline...I can't imagine speculoos is healthy, nothing that tastes this good is ever healthy but I really couldn't care less at the moment. With your $6 price tag for 2 toppings, first one free, and your yummy (likely fattening) goodness, it's probably best that you're so difficult to track down Wafels & Dinges truck. The only drawbacks are the same with any mobile food. There's no where to sit, it's kind of hard to eat without utensils and it's a little messy regardless, NYers are rightfully upset that you're blocking the sidewalk, and speculoos sticks to the roof of your mouth (but no worse than peanut butter does).

1035,KIbEm8oQwyga3ce7hdGlZA,Angela N.,4.0 star rating,"Finally got a chance to try the liege wafel and it was tasty! The texture of the wafel definitely is different from the standard Belgium Waffles you have at your local diner, which uses a batter while the former a dough (embedded with these special sugar cubes that add crunch, crisp and taste). Had the Speckuloos (speck-ku-lo) spread and the Dulce de Leche sauce (on the side). The Speckuloo spread was great, but it has the texture of peanut butter (and the taste of ginger-gramham crackers) so it's smart to have a drink handy in order to gobble the entire wafel down. It's quite a heavy tasting combo, but something to try with the Wafel & Dinges Truck -come on, it's their specialty! The Dulce de Leche sauce wasn't necessary because the thick caramelize sauce made the combo even more rich and sticky. Next time, perhaps adding some whipped cream or some fruit would lighten the Speckuloo + Liege experience. I'd also just go for the liege on it's own in the future. The (Persian - we learned - ) guy taking the order at the Trader Joe's location was flirty, fun and a hit with costumers who were lined up (especially the ladies). He made me laugh and I gave him the ""ok, to date my twin.""  Ha.  Great dessert to end the night after Hill County Chicken (tho stuffed as you can imagine)!",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I wanted to try them since we were already over there. Yummm~ I got the hot Belgium chocolate & the liege waffel [what dingie I forget] My friend got a skewered mini liege with whole strawberries I seem to recall. It was awesome just enjoying the hot Belgium chocolate while I waited for my friends to come out.The latest time was with my aunt & cousin during August this year. We walked through central park and passed the zoo. I was looking for the same stand again but I think I found their other stand. All I know it was behind this huge metal spider on the sidewalk & there were horse-drawn carriages at the circle. I got the mini liege wafel this time, though no skewer and tiny chopped up strawberry pieces. Sort of disappointed me on that thus why it lost a star. My aunt & cousin had the liege wafel & when they finish she told me that was very filling.

Topped with bananas and whip cream and I had the warmest waffle made with love-mmmm! My mate had a waffle with vanilla ice cream on top and whip cream. We shared their hot cocoa. The waffle was crisp on top, dense and sweet on its own. The aroma is the best. The hot Cocoa was good but it was too much sweet going on with the meal. It was smooth but rather on the sweet side, unlike Jaques Torres' richly decadent Chocolate. The good news is they offer more in terms of drinks like water, coffee and tea. ill ask about that next time. altogether the items came up to 16 bucks total. not bad considering all we got. The waffle was pretty good and I think next time I will try a different kind of waffle with more fruit and ice cream. They have some interesting names of their trucks and the meaning of the names on the side if you look. The people are so much fun and give you a free topping based on their Facebook trivia. They take card at the location by columbus circle with a 6 dollar minimum which is awesome , and not hard to meet considering what you'd want to put on your waffles. Bottom line, I love the idea of a place where I can get a waffle to go. Their spread is creamy and delicious (i prefer it over the dulce) and the fruit is fresh. Great place to meet funny people with a smile, humorous, and who seem to like what they do for the most part while getting a great feed on a waffle.

Only minor complaint I have are with the times they don't give me a fresh waffle and just reheat a pre-cooked one.  It's hit or miss sometimes but just know that you're not getting the full experience until you've had their fresh waffles.  I'm happy to say the Wafel & Dinges truck is one I will always visit if I see it around and I highly recommend you stop by if you see it too.On a sidenote, I love the jars of speckuloos they sell now.  They run about $7 for a 14 oz. jar (slightly smaller than a peanut butter jar).  Little pricey but once you try it, you won't be able to stop eating it.  Works best straight out of the jar or on some toast for breakfast.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

YUM, I found this cart outside on Hudson St and was immediately drawn to the pictures of Belgian waffles dancing on the side of the truck. I got the ""WMD waffle"", which means for $7 you can put as many toppings as you want on it. I tried nutella, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate sauce on my waffle and it was pure decadence! The waffle itself is about the size of a very thick slide of bread, I thought it was a little small for $7.. It's served in a cardboard container w/ an open side so that you can just hold up the box to your lips and eat it without a fork! (Kind of like pizza). The only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is that I thought the portion was pretty tiny. But, still tastes great w/ coffee from the truck!

Ok then. I'll wait. So wafel man is chatting up the current customers, probably thinking that these foolios in front of me are just trying to figure out what to get. Clearly, he's ready to take the next order and I'm getting sick of waiting. So, I'm ready to jump in front of these guys if they don't order soon. I give them some attitude, and I'm like, Are you guys going to order? And they start inching towards the truck.OMG. Really? 3 people order ONE hot chocolate. Did it really take you that long to figure that out? So you just wasted 5 minutes of my time. I want my damn wafel!  I got things to do, and places to be!

1117,Uk4aTFbdLPuSgwkn-rbqEQ,Julie K.,3.0 star rating,"Ate here two nights back to back.  First time with one of my bestfriend and another with my beau. Two different experiences... First time: My friends and I just finished a meal at May's Sushi and wanted to get out of the place and look for a place for dessert.  I went on Twitter to check if any of the sweet foods trucks were around and saw that Wafels and Dinges Truck was by Union Sq.  So we paid our bill and started walking to the location.  My friends spotted out the school bus yellow truck before I did.   There was a small crowd when we arrived but the wait was not long at all Dining Time: 9pmReason for Dining: Wanted a new and quick served dessert Service: 3 guys working in the truck. They were nice and was able to answer our questions like ""what are dinges"" and what's their special spread ""spekuloos spread"" was... Food:  One of my friends and I chose BRUSSELS WAFEL, 1 scoop of RASPBERRY VANILLA ICECREAM and NUTELLA, which drizzled all across the top. I thought the wafel wouldn't be that great since the guy just picked a pre-made one and put it on one of the many wafel makers to warm it up but was I wrong!  The wafel was airy and light and just melted in my mouth when I took a bite.  The ice-cream was just ice-cream and  nutella is as fabulous as chocolate fudge on a sundae.  GREAT COMBO!  NOTE: my friend would've ate all of it but she recalled that she was SHARING with me and stopped inhaling it 1/2 way through. If she didn't share with me, she would've finished the whole thing by the time it takes to walk one NY street blockSecond time: Although my beau and I were full from a dinner at Gyu Kaku, we were still in search for dessert.  We would've eaten dessert at the restaurant but they ran out of the famous Green Tea crepes so that's that.   I quickly searched on Twitter and there it goes the truck nearly 2 blocks away from Gyu.Dining Time: 1am Reason for Dining: Search for dessert Service: Wafel and Dinges offers a free dinges if you do what they say on their daily Tweet. Today, you get a free dinges if you give an evil eye. My beau did it but we still had to end up paying $1 bc we chose ice cream as one of our dinges which costs $2 for a scoop so technically we didn't get that for free but got 50% off.  The guys working at this truck weren't as flirtatious as the ones from the previous location but he was still nice.  Food: LIEGE WAFEL, SPEKULOOS SPREAD, and scoop of VANILLA ICE CREAM. They sprinkled powdered sugar on top.   I'm not really a fan of this kind wafel. A bit thick and chewy for me for a dessert. This would be a good breakfast wafel though.  RECOMMEND THE SPREAD- it's a cross between a nut butter with graham crakers OVERALL - Choose the Brussel if you want something light and sweet , great option for a light sweet dessert! If you're looking for something a bit more substantial to be a meal, I recommend Leige Wafel - top it with the spread and maybe some fruit and you'll have meal!

My friend got a waffle with bananas, cream and chocolate syrup. That was amazing too. The banana slices were fresh and the cream on it was decadent and sweet. TESTIMONY: I hate waffles. Unless they are eggos from when I was a kid. The rest have been terrible. Even the eggos are bad, but they bring nostalgia to the table. I remember walking to the truck and being irritated with everything. After the waffle, I had a smile on my face that I couldn't get off. Too bad the truck is not in my area everyday.

I was with two other friends that hadn't tried the truck before either and we decided to split one brussels wafel and one liege wafel between us so we could try them both! On our brussels wafel (the crunchier one) we got practically every topping there was (strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, nutella, dulce de leche, and spekuloos) since it's only $2 for unlimited toppings so you might as well! Our expert friend who accompanied us and who has come here so often that the workers recognize him, described the spekuloos as tasting like teddy grahams...and the comparison was spot-on! On our liege wafel we took a simpler route and only got ice cream and chocolate fudge on it. It's hard to say which wafel I liked more!

I've seen him leaving atleast a 1/2hr earlier than that and I know sometimes he leaves earlier. Finally, I told my friend that I had to Yelp this truck!

They had a cute stand at the holiday market (which for some reason took forever to find, but it was really just on the outside of the market) and a nice, interactive (is that even the right word) guy took our order. I had a bite of my cousin's waffle with the speculoos spread a few weeks ago and it was the most amazing thing in the world, so I definitely had to try that. The guy said that bananas went well with the spread so I got it. And then I added some whipped cream and fudge just because I had 1 free dinge from the daily challenge (remember to check out their twitter for a daily challenge! I got the answer wrong but they gave it to me anyway). I was staring at the waffle as I tried to find a place to eat it. It took me probably 5 minutes or less to gobble it down because it was so delicious, but I don't know... it was one of those things where I really regret eating afterwards. It's way too sweet for me. I think it's the spread that is really too sweet. I would love it more if I split it with other people, because now I don't feel too great from how sweet it is. But I don't know, my excuse is that I'm Asian, so I can't deal with super sweet things as well. But the waffle was crunchy on the sides and I thought the speculoos spread was the perfect mix with that crunchiness - it was like biting into solid caramel in my mouth mmmm. I would probably go again... but this is definitely one of those places where I want to go super badly and then regret it after I eat a waffle. So I'm not sure how to rate this...

Particularly with this truck.Fun fact of the day - did you know that August 24th is National Waffle Day?! Well, since I was a smarty and signed up for the W&D email list, I got an email last night saying that the truck is celebrating today. They were offering free toppings ALL day today, along with free wafels from 11:30-12:30.Running late (thanks, post office), I got into the city right at 12:30. The last guy in line (yup, there was a line) said he was the last free wafel recipient. At this point, I figured ""Ah hell, I'll just buy one if that's the case."" When the W&D santa came over, passing out free posters and magnets, he told me there was no more free wafels. Joking around, I said ""Aw, an unemployed girl can't get a break!"" and he told me that if I did the job of letting everyone after me know that there were no more free wafels, really work for it, maybe I could get one free!To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with how friendly everyone working there was. The ""Santa's helpers"" in the truck were so nice, answering questions (""What the heck is spekuloos?"" - Answer? Yummy, peanut butter consistency spread made of biscuits (European, lightly sweetened cracker/cookies.) YUM.)I took a chance with a liege topped with (free!) spekuloos and strawberries and an iced coffee. They fix the coffee to your liking, for anyone that's curious.The liege wasn't probably brand spankin new fresh, but he had popped them back in the press to warm them up. The wafel itself was yummy, chewy, rich. The spekuloos is oddly exactly how the W&D guy described and the tart berries really helped balance everything out. The coffee was good, nothing to write home about.So, here's my summary - for $5, the size of the liege isn't quite... well, for someone with a small wallet, I might feel a little ripped off. But, for a free wafel? Uh-maz-ing. I definitely think it's a great post-bar snack when you're a touch too tipsy to care how much you're paying, hah.

They took a decadent wafel, threw fresh fruit on it, drizzled some sweet syrup over the fresh fruit, then powdered the whole thing in sugar. ""The fresh fruit balances the other ingredients. The fresh fruit balances the other ingredients,"" I keep telling myself. How else can I justify eating this overkill-of-a-waffle. I'm sorry, wa-fel (belgian for uber-waffle, apparently). With my conscience thoroughly sedated, I ordered my wafel.My caloric intake of the day was: Light & Crispy Brussels Wafel, topped with fresh strawberries, drizzled with nutella, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. That thing is so heavenly. The wafel was light, crispy, and filling, as advertised. The strawberries were fresh & juicy, not too tart, and not too sweet. The nutella imparts its signature nutty flavor to the mix, but it doesn't oversweeten the wafel as chocolate fudge has a tendency to do. Finally, the powdered sugar just ups the sweetness factor of the whole thing by the slightest bit.The dessert is a work of art. The meal is light but filling, and it's filling without feeling heavy. And, it's sweet, but not overly sweet. I cannot look at a regular waffle without thinking about that Belgian Wafel & Dinges, and I can't walk by their dessert truck with out drooling & reminiscing about my first experience with them.Now, if they could only throw some smothered chicken on there.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I have heard a ton about these waffles and even seen them on some ""10 Best Desserts"" TV show that I found on netflix streaming one night. Tried them a few weeks ago when they came to outside the Queens Center near my place.I got a brussels wafel with belgian choc fudge and whipped cream ($6 I think). The wafel was served in an open-top cardboard carton. The waffle was not bad (fluffy and tasty) but I thought it was really not that special. The Boy (huge waffle fan) shared and agreed that it was good, and probably a little above average, but overhyped. It's a bit messy so I would not be having this with someone you want to impress, or in clothes you paid more than $100 for. Although given it's location, the Wafel is definitley better (and cheaper) than the one I coulda gotten at Georgia Diner down the block....I could eat here again but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I'm more of a savory-foods type of person too so given the option between Wafel and some other food truck I probably wouldn't waste my calories either.Service was good though - super friendly pair of dudes. I did tell the first ""waffle"" guy I wanted choc fudge which for some reason I think he didn't hear - but second ""toppings"" guy was only to happy to help me add on.In summary: Good waffle, safe choice, somewhat overhyped, friendly service.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

She spends a portion of each day sobbing in an awkward fashion, after which we come up with a game plan to cheer her up. I'm totally down for the ""after which"" part, because it tends to involve roaming around while eating and drinking.Last night, after a particularly quiet round of sniffling, we went to a few places, most of which I have already reviewed. The place we ended up at, however, I have not.I have passed by this truck almost countless times.This time, we had to stop. In fact, we stopped twice. The first time we stopped, she loudly complained that she 'didn't want any dessert shit because she wasn't done eating, yo'. This took us to Crif Dogs to finish stuffing our faces with bacon-wrapped and artery clogging amazing-ness. When we were done with that, she had apparently decided it was now time to face the dessert.. Yo.We stood in front of the cart.And stared at the menu.And had no idea what to order.Fortunately, I had heard of this cart, as well as seeing it, and knew of its fame in defeating Bobby Flay (who seems to lose many throwdowns to things in NY, just saying) and so we determined that the thing to order would be the Throwdown Wafel. Turns out, this was indeed the thing to order. I can't speak of the other things that are on this cart. I can't speak for other items, places, people or pets or whatever else there is out there. Most of these things are because I am writing this review at 5pm while drunk. But also because this thing was effing heaven on a little piece of thin and folded cardboard.Waffle+Spekuloos+Whipped Cream+Powedered Sugar+two guys in a cart that are hysterically funny= amazing food truck experience.Nothing less than 5 stars, and that's rolling in the fact that my coat got enough powdered sugar on it to look like i'd stepped in on a party with Motley Crue.

The first thing that bothered me was that my wafel wasn't made fresh; it was actually barely warm when I got it.

The waffles themselves were OOOkay.  The Leige tasted like compressed danish that had been caramelized on the outside.  It IS much denser, chewier, and richer, but I think the fact that it was merely reheated kind of took the fun out of it for me. The Belgian wouldn't have tasted good without the toppings--dark, really rich belgian chocolate fudge sauce and the whipped cream didn't taste like it was watered down either.  At $5 each ($4 for the plain Leige waffle), while I'm glad I tried it, I think I would have rather spent the money (and calories!) at Dessert Truck.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

After said turtles were found and lovingly gazed on for seconds on end, I realized that the cart was the infamous Wafels and Dinges. Backtrack: Prior to walking into Central Park, ""Germy"" had retraced his steps to an ice cream vendor in search of dessert, but was not pleased with the options. Flashforward: bemused, I said to Germy, well if you want something sweet, this is as good a place as any aaannnnddd it's not everyday that you run into it. Not in the know about the whole dealio, I had to explain it to him. Intrigued, but not willing to be overwhelmed, he ordered a brussels wafel with melted chocolate fudge and a scoop of ice cream. While we were waiting, the guys inside were incredibly friendly and such a delight to talk to. Unfortunately for us, the chocolate hardened so quickly that it turned into a ""magic shell"" of sorts making it nearly impossible to eat with plastic utensils on a park bench. It might have soured the experience for the both of us. I'm not going to tell you that it didn't taste good, but it didn't reach stellar heights either. However, if I ever find myself in the neighborhood and in the mood for something sweet, I may consider trying something else for novelty's sake.

Never thought I would update a review from 1 to 5 stars, but here I am...so I never actually tasted this product as you can see...today I was treated to waffles from here and was damn impressed. There is a soft waffle you can have that carries a strong vanilla flavor. Then there is a waffle that is a bit crunchy because the edges have been carmelized somehow and it is sugary-sweet. Each waffle is $5 and nice tasting on their own, or with a bit of powdered sugar that is free. Or, you can choose to have toppings; each topping is a $1 and two or three toppings is $2. Being the pig that I am, I chose each type of waffle with three toppings. The strawberries really add balance to the waffle, as they are freshly cut and high quality. The hazelnut spread is nice. The belgian dark chocolate spread overpowers the waffle, but it is delicious. The dulce de leche is light and very sweet, for sugar addicts (hello!), this can make you close your eyes. The spekuloos spread is interesting, very graham cracker-y and unique really. Personally I would not choose for a waffle more than two toppings, as it just morphs the waffle into this piece of pastry that is holding your toppings and the waffle flavor itself gets lost. I would go for strawberries and one other at most. Now as to value; it is worth it (YES, I will actually PAY for this in the future), just because the waffles on their own are quite good (although the soft waffle can be a bit dry). I still think that selling the little sized pieces of waffle for $3 each are a complete waste of time and money for the customer, half that price would be worth it value wise to get a sense of what you could buy for $5, but perhaps not for the owners of this business. I found it insulting as a passerby initially, but maybe I'm too sensitive (or, simply, not ""right in the head"").

1343,0FT_WBR_CI304_vGzN9BHg,Kelly R.,4.0 star rating,"I went for International Waffle Day. They were having a deal that if you wore yellow, you got a free waffle + 1 topping. So I quickly made a wristband out of a yellow folder and ran down to find the truck. I had to have my fave, which has three toppings, so I still shelled out $2 for the extra two dinges. Brussels waffle with strawberries, bananas, and fudge. Just do it. So good. Anyway, I also stuffed a dollah in the tip jar since I was feeling so rich, getting a delish waffle for $2. The guy making the waffle asked the guy cooking the waffles which kind I had wanted, and the guy making the waffles motioned to four burnt-looking waffles sitting next to the waffle iron. Ummmm, okay. The guy took one of the burnt waffles, fixed it up with the dinges, and handed it to me. Now, my normal waffle eating strategy is to slide the waffle down to the edge, and just keep sliding it towards my mouth as I munch it down. However, this waffle wasn't sliding...and normally it's so crispy that it's hard to eat it with a fork. I used my fork, and a piece pulled off (it didn't *break* off) easily...because although it was burned on the top side, it was undercooked on the inside. So it was a little crispy, and mostly batter-y. I was like, ""Oh, maybe it's because I got my waffle for free..."" but there were PILES of beautifully fresh, perfectly riped strawberries and bananas on top! He certainly didn't skimp there! And they had been very friendly, too.So I was disappointed about the waffle, but the fruit really made up for it. Nothing pleases me more than good fruit, and I really got a lot of it. The waffle still *tasted* okay, but, I mean...waffles should be crispy. They shouldn't be easy to eat with a plastic fork.

It was a Friday afternoon and it's parked in a mostly business-y part of town. You can't miss the truck as it's a bright yellow. Two really upbeat guys were working in the truck. Everyone in front of me didn't specify which waffle they wanted and so they had to explain between the Belgium and the Liege. They must have to do this a million times a day yet they sounded really nice about it every time. Kudos to them. I would be so annoyed. It's on the menu, people. Anyways since I wasn't too hungry, I just got the Belgium, which is a lot lighter than the other one, with strawberries and powdered sugar. The waffle was five bucks. You get one topping or dingel for free and more will cost ya. They have like 10+ different dingels. The powdered sugar is free. They make the waffle when you order it so it comes out really fresh and hot. I loved it. My only minor complaint is that the waffle is not sweet at all. The sugar and berries and I'm sure, other toppings too, help with this. But yea, the liege is described as sweeter of the two. Next time I'm back in the city, I want to try the liege and the Bobby Flay one also. I remember seeing that episode too and didn't put two and two together that this was that particular truck.

I walked up to the truck (by the way the guys were so friendly) like a pro and ordered my wafel and it was ready in no time! I practically ran back to my desk to sit down and try my wafel and it did not dissapoint!  It was really really good, I loved it, however it was just a little too much for me that about 2/3rd of the way I was pretty much done with and was so full but I refused to throw the remaining portion away and forced myself to finish.  I'm definitely going back to try out some other stuff (pulled pork with cole slaw) but I think I'll bring my sis along so I can share, I cannot force myself again that was too indulgent and as good as it was I didn't like the way I felt afterward lol",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

If this truck was in Dumbo on a Friday OMG, i would be in trouble, i'd need a larger sized wardrobe. I attempted to go to starbucks on Front st, there was no parking & the line was about 10 people deep so no shot of a quick dbl park and running in for a cup of Joe. Fortunately construction did not allow me to take my normal route to work, i wound up having to loop around only to stumble upon the ""truck"", which i remember from throwdown w/ bobby flay and to my surprise a parking spot right behind the truck. i stopped, ordered a cup of coffee and the throwdown wafel, went back to my car and indulged, i quickly called my foodie friends from work, i sent them a picture of this piece of heaven and demanded that they come downstairs and get in my car so i could escort them to this truck that serves pieces of paradise. They obliged and we headed back, i made my suggestion to follow in my footsteps and order the 'throwdown"" wafel, Emery did, i watched as he took his 1st bite, his eyes closed as if he was whisked away on a mini vacation as he chewed. As I, he did not believe anything could taste so delicious, Cesar went a little overboard, he got a wafel with ice cream, whipped cream, berries, chocolate syrup, bananas, nuts etc. he too enjoyed it very much. i can not say enough about this wonderful experience and look forward to starting a W&D religion, after one bite, getting followers will be a cinch. Lastly, their coffee is amazing as well....***UPDATE 8/9/2010*** I just wanted to add to my review as to be fair. 2 weeks after my 1st experience i continued to talk about it to the point that my fiancée insisted i take her for wafels & dinges, she has a liege with strawberry, banana & maple syrup & a belgium hot chocolate, which was insanely thick and chocolaty . I, once again had a coffee & a throwdown wafel and it was once again, GREAT!!! BUT, the following Monday i was driving to work and found myself in that bad place again,  Front st, DUMBO, i said i would pass and see if i found parking, which i did. i ordered a Brussels wafel with Nutella & of course a large coffee.

Now, I stumbled upon this truck after a massive dinner, but because this truck was one of my ""to-do-in-NYC"" list, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. I bought the waffle that evening and safely placed it in the fridge. The next morning for breakfast, I took a thirsty ""bite"" at the waffle. My eyes widened and my nostrils flared. I was hestitant that the waffle had gone stale, or even worse, soggy. But nope. It's none of that. The waffle still had it's crunch and the taste isn't lacking at all! The lingering sweet taste of the belgian waffle is different from your typical Eggo. No no no, Wafels & Dinges liege waffles surpass that by 5 football fields.

Not a real problem for me  because I'm a guy but a real problem for most New York females.3) Sure $7 is a small price to pay for this kind of bliss, but $7 adds up and bliss fades quickly.4) Once, the machine was broken so I couldn't even order the type of waffle I wanted and on top of that, the guy got the order I didn't really want anyways completely wrong.

He even said I could get a free topping if I tried again.So I subscribed to their twitter feed (!) to see when our locations would cross again and, lo and behold, found out that they tend to set up camp in Midtown on weekdays mere blocks from where I work.  This review would be 4.5 stars if it could because I tried going to the truck twice before having any success-- both times the truck said it'd be at it's locale until 4pm and both times I tried going around 3:40 and they were already gone.  I'm sure it ain't easy to secure a parking space in midtown for a day, but if you're gonna depart before you say you're going to depart, at least update your Twitter feed for those who rely on it to get your whereabouts!Third time's a charm.  When I finally got to the truck, i was rewarded with a delicious waffle as described by so many reviewers before me here for $4.  And many days they give you a code via their twitter feed for a free topping-- it would behoove you to check the feed.  I got me the brussels wafel with nutella; next time I'll give their liege a second try.",Wafels & Dinges,4.5 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Food, Trucks"

I was obviously meant to try W&D - if the mountain (me) won't come to Mohammad (W&D), Mohammad must go to the mountain. :D It was that fateful day I first tried the delicious wafels this truck offers. The wafel is crisp and crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and the combination results in a wonderfully chewy goodness. Cue in dinges/toppings: strawberries and spekuloos spread for me. The fruit is fresh and they don't skimp out by giving you just a few pieces. The spekuloos sauce was really good!

Sorry, wafel.My favorite of the three is the cinnamon liege, definitely. The liege wafel is dense and more sugary than the regular Belgian wafel and the cinnamon makes it so you don't even need to heap any toppings--dinges--on it. I got strawberries on my regular liege and enjoyed it, but I might have also preferred it w/ nothing or just powdered sugar. The regular one is probably the one that most needs a topping.

They tell us that they are, and that they are ready for our quotes; I start to panic slightly because this gaggle of girls is still standing nearby, and I know that they will think I am some sort of insane person when I start yelling at the waffle dude, so I try to get my friend to go first, she tells me to go first.

So much so that I didn't even write a review.Last night was different. I was craving waffle. I have been following the truck on twitter for a couple months now and everyday they tell me where they are. Sometimes, just a couple blocks from my job! They spend many evenings in front of Trader Joe's and since it was on the way to Webster Hall I went ahead and stopped under the awning to fulfill my craving. I had a Wafel of Massive Deliciousness. YES! All the toppings you want. 7 bucks! I went for the light and crispier of the two wafels. And had my chef put strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, marshmallows, and powdered sugar on top. I think even he was impressed with my order. Oh yeah baby! hehehehe. It was great. The wafel was kind of warm so it did this sort of melt in your mouth thing.

I wonder what it is and its Wafels and Dinges. Sadly, I didn't have any money, however just smelling it made me want one. So today I was walking in that same area and the cart was still there and I just happen to bring my wallet. So after waiting for 2 minutes, I decided to try the daily special waffle, wafel de smores. It was a waffle with spekuloos, belgian chocolate, and marshmallows. So waiting for it, the smell engulfs the great lawn area of the park. people float there, sort of like the cartoons. i got my waffle and walked to the nearest bench, it wasn't gonna be neat if I ate it standing up. I cut my first bite, it had all of the elements. the waffle , spekuloos, chocolate, and marshmallow. I opened my mouth and automatically my life changed. It was sweet from the chocolate, savory from the waffle, and a little bit sweeter with the spekuloos. That SAUCE is INCREDIBLE. I don't know what it was, peanut buttery, caramelesque. I don't know. Each bite was better than the last, especially the one with all the elements. When it was over, I was sad. It was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten.
