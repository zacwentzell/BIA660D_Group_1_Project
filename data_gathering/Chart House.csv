More on that in a moment. Valet is all the way towards the entrance which is hard to see when you first pull in - I suspect some people don't realize (or see) it's an option and end up parking on their own in one of the many spots as they drive in. If you do valet, it's $8.We arrived 20 minutes before the dining room opened for lunch/our reservation time, so we were told to wait which was totally fine. They should have mentioned the door near the bar that leads out to the amazing terrace/walkway area on the water! Also a little surprised there weren't more seating options in the lobby area. Just 4 deep armless chairs near the restrooms but nothing really in the lobby. Still, an impressive and lovely atmosphere to soak in!The gentleman who walked us to our table was sweet and wished me a happy birthday. We were the only ones there and got the window table we were hoping for. I must say, not sure if it's an OpenTable issue or a restaurant issue, but when we tried to book a reservation on OT, there was no availability. Sure enough, we called Chart House direct and had no issue getting a table for the time we wanted, and now that we're here, it's EMPTY. No sweat! Just something to note: call in for a table if your app isn't working for ya.Our server was very nice. Wine and cocktail menus extensive with LOTS of really tempting options. It was actually hard to make a decision with so many good options! We went with the mojito flight. I think this is a great value and beautifully presented. Three mini drinks per person plus a gorgeous vessel of ""extra"" - a crisp blood orange, a deep rich blackberry and a wonderful mango all poured fresh in front of you for $20-something dollars. Coconut shrimp app was served beautifully. Only 5-6 shrimp but 3 sauces to dip and an edible shell to hold the shrimp made it seem plentiful.Hummus platter was huuuuge. Server warned us and we ended up packing some to bring home. The red pepper hummus had some hard pieces of seed blended in it. All could've used a pinch of salt but better than oversalted - I'll take it! Extra plantain chips were offered and appreciated.So far, service, appetizers, drinks and view are all just stellar. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way about the entrees at all. They were a whole different class of quality. Wedding food, previously frozen, no special touch, can't put my finger on it but all these things come to mind. Grouper was soggy, mushy, water logged, full of dark meat and bones. Sauce out of a bottle. Rice wasn't coconut as advertised and veggies had to have been previously frozen or else just unseasoned. How could the apps be so gorgeous and my entree be so disappointing? My husband's grilled mahi with added fruit salsa was also mushy and full of bones like mine. His rice was the same undercooked yellow rice I had that should've been soft, fluffy coconut rice as advertised. We were full from what we had so we passed on ordering dessert. In true Landry's style, our server was kind enough to bring our surprise complimentary dessert due to the fact that it was my birthday -- a ""sample size"" (still huge) portion of their mud cake which is coffee ice cream, fudge and a dollop of whipped cream. Very nice!Landry's Club membership serves us well; I highly recommend it to anyone who dines here, Morton's (our fave) or any other restaurant in the Landry's family.

6,AI1rYT1Hu-sIvKxGL0jW_A,Emily J.,4.0 star rating,"Most family birthdays are spent here and I'm surprised it has taken me this long to write a review. The restaurant is beautiful and perfect for (an expensive) date night or celebration. Reservations should be made as it's harder to get a seat without one. Highly recommend asking for a seat by the water as the view of the NYC skyline is breathtaking. Cocktails here are a must try. I like my whiskey sours here. Also, I know the bread is so good and refillable but save yourself for appetizers. If you are going for the bread, choose the darker one. You'll see why. Our go-to will always be the oysters and the fried shrimp served with 3 different types of sauces I'll never particularly enjoy. Whatevs, oysters here are fresh, usually from the east coast & served with the cutest mini hot sauce bottles. From steak to fish, everything here is usually on point. I'd say opt for the a medium rare filget mignon, served with the most decadent mashed potatoes. And when you're all wrapped up do opt for the chocolate lava cake. It's made in house and topped with vanilla ice cream. Be sure to order this at the beginning of your meal as it takes an hour for them to prepare. Oh and on birthdays they send you home with the menus that have ""happy birthday"" printed at the top.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The service could of been better. Our server missed a lot of things but he always made sure to personally check on me to make sure that I was having a great dinner since it was my special night. I really appreciated that and it made all the thing that went wrong seem very small. All of the food and cocktails were delicious. My friend order a side of the mushroom truffle butter for her steak and OMG it was to die for!!! I literally stole it from her and dipped everything I could in it.

9,ApbNxkBEczf1zVY5RHaLqw,Xenia M.,1.0 star rating,"The Chart House is probably one of the most overrated restaurants I've ever been to. This establishment was highly recommended to me for my birthday dinner, and I'm sad to say they disappointed on many levels.Firstly, you would think that a restaurant of this caliber would provide toilet paper in the ladies bathroom...Wrong! It was an inconvenience just to get some toilet paper, which already set the tone of my experience here. Secondly, my fiancé requested to have ""happy birthday"" displayed on my menu. However, that was not the case, my menu appeared blank. Alright no big deal. Our server, was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the food. So we decided to start off with the wicked tuna trio, which was just OK, nothing special. For our entree, my fiancé ordered the salmon, and I ordered the spinach gnocchi with shrimp and scallops. My scallops were cooked perfectly. However, my gnocchi tasted like rubber. I could barely chew it. The salmon had a very strong over powering flavor of mustard. So strong, we couldn't finish the meal.When asked if there could be anything done to fix this, the manager said he would comp our champagne and give us dessert on him -- Great! When we received our bill, we were charged for our dessert, which was promised by the manager to be taken care of. This led to a hassle of back and forth between the waiter and manager, taking up our time.I also found it interesting that two tables who sat next to us also returned their food back to the kitchen. Not to mention, the food here is ridiculously priced. You pay for the beautiful view! Everything else is garbage.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Yeh the view is great, the place is beautiful, the service is decent..but it's all about the FOOD! I ordered the Ribeye that came with ""garlic mashed potatoes"" and my girl had the only chicken option on the menu, and I could not believe how bad the ribeye steak was, I felt like I was eating school lunch. Even the side of garlic mash was terrible, I didn't think you could mess up garlic mashed potatoes. For apps, we had the calamari and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was pretty good but the calamari had a very fishy taste to it which was very unusual. Idk maybe it was a bad batch but it did not taste good at all. The chicken dish was decent at best. We also had a side of the creamed spinach which just tasted terrible. The only thing that tasted amazing was the bread that they gave us before our food.And last but not least, the dessert. We had the lava cake that everyone was raving about and honestly it was wayyy overrated. It was a decent lava cake, nothing special at all. In fact, the one from dominos tastes 10x better. Overall, the food at this place was just not good at all.

11,UXCPmnMfwIjuXhBvtZRIEQ,Allyssa C.,3.0 star rating,"Meh.My fiance and I went here for Brunch on a Sunday to celebrate closing on our first house. I had been here once before when my sister was considering the Chart House as a venue for her wedding so let me be the first to admit, the view is gorgeous, and you are definitely paying a premium for it. Unfortunately, the day that my SO and I came, it was extremely foggy and you could barely see the first row of buildings on the other side of the river. So this review is focused purely on food and service.I had never been here for Brunch before and didn't realize until we arrived that there wasn't an option to order from a menu. We ordered drinks (choices of coffee, tea, and juices) from our waiter and waited there for a bit before we saw others going up to the buffet. The waiter brought us our drinks and explained where the line formed for the buffet.We then proceeded to stand on line for about 15-20 minutes. The buffet selection was sufficient but not stellar. Most of the food was typical buffet food with runny scrambled eggs and floppy bacon. The only hot food stations were an omelette station with pretty limited options, and a carving station with beef and pork. The food tasted good but nothing was ""OMG"" good, in my opinion. I personally hate eating cold food that is meant to be hot so I was definitely disappointed. In addition, it was freezing in the restaurant that day so by the time we got back to the table my coffee was cold. Once we finished, it took a bit for us to flag down a waiter for our check. And once we paid, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for him to come back with my card. Don't get me wrong, the waiter was extremely friendly and apologized, but it was clear they were under-staffed that day. Overall, I will definitely come back on a clear day for dinner, but brunch did not do it for me. As I said, you pay a premium for the view, and $39 per person for brunch is definitely a premium. When there is no view, it tends to be a lackluster experience. Definitely won't be back for brunch.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

14,232xdmoVvdRJ6d8wAa_yUw,Adebunmi S.,1.0 star rating,"Yesterday, March 3 2018, my Fiance and I hosted our Bridal Proposal Brunch which entailed asking some of our close friends and family to be in our wedding party. 17 people attended the event and our bill was $1109, $1309 with tip. This event is the second large group event that we hosted at The Chart House in Weehawken, first event was when my Fiance proposed to me in front of our friends and family (a total of 23 guests with a bill nearing $2000). I am writing  because I was interested in having future bridal events at Chart House like a rehearsal dinner and bridesmaid brunch, but given the way our night visit ended yesterday I highly doubt that it would be in our best interest. Yesterday my fiance and I gifted all of our wedding party with jewelry and beauty items. One of my bridesmaids forgot a Coach gift bag at the establishment. The bag contained a Coach wristlet ($75), a Michael Kors watch ($275), and 2 Sunday Riley beauty products ($150). A total of $500 dollars. Because she and the rest of the party had also received a gift box with other items, four hours passed between when we left the establishment and when she noticed the gift bag was missing. During that time I was not contacted by a manager even though my name and number was on file. My friend and I both called to inquire about the bag and was told that a manager would contact us.My friend went back to The Chart House, that same night, and after some delay a manager brought the gift bag out from a back office. The Michael Kors watch was missing from the bag. The manager was unable to tell my friend who found the bag and why an item was missing from the bag.The manager (Bill) also stated that the reason why he did not contact me was because he didn't know if the bag was empty or not. By the weight of the bag, it should have been clear that there were items in the bag.I am concerned that:(1) A bag was found and the manager did not attempt to contact the party associated with the bag(2) The manager explained his negligence by saying that the reason why he didn't call was because he didn't know if the bag was empty or not.(3)The manager said he didn't know who found the bag, another sign of negligence.(4) An item was missing from the bag and he did not ask his staff about it. (5) The manager spoke very rudely to my friend and showed no interest in following up on the missing item nor was he apologetic. He repeatedly stated that there was nothing he could do about it. An establishment that large, which is part of a larger company (Landry) needs to have routine procedures for handling lost items. At the very least, the party on reservation should have been contacted regarding the item. It seems to me that the manager and his staff were going to wait it out and claim the items.

We always start with oysters that are always fresh and great.This time we also ordered the korean fried calamari and the only Korean thing about it was the name. Drenching the calamari in sweet chili sauce don't not make it korean. The calamari was also overcooked and rubbery. We ordered more starters like the gazpacho and more shrimp that were okayWe also ordered grilled salmon and grilled cod with the crab topping and it was really only okay.. it wasn't worth the price The service was good but it is really slow.

As you know, the atmosphere here is amazing. you get to see the city while eating food. How great is that! Food is great as well. We ordered steak as medium rare which came out perfectly medium rare, salmon wasn't too dry, coconut shrimp was very crunchy, creamy spinach was just delicious. that mango avocado crab tower was very refreshing, fresh and delicious. I asked for a recommendation for red wine to Kyle and his recommendation was just great.He also recommended getting a reward card which I thought was a great deal (please ask more detail to your waiter/waitress).My mom and aunt loved the place.

26,AI1rYT1Hu-sIvKxGL0jW_A,Emily J.,4.0 star rating,"Most family birthdays are spent here and I'm surprised it has taken me this long to write a review. The restaurant is beautiful and perfect for (an expensive) date night or celebration. Reservations should be made as it's harder to get a seat without one. Highly recommend asking for a seat by the water as the view of the NYC skyline is breathtaking. Cocktails here are a must try. I like my whiskey sours here. Also, I know the bread is so good and refillable but save yourself for appetizers. If you are going for the bread, choose the darker one. You'll see why. Our go-to will always be the oysters and the fried shrimp served with 3 different types of sauces I'll never particularly enjoy. Whatevs, oysters here are fresh, usually from the east coast & served with the cutest mini hot sauce bottles. From steak to fish, everything here is usually on point. I'd say opt for the a medium rare filget mignon, served with the most decadent mashed potatoes. And when you're all wrapped up do opt for the chocolate lava cake. It's made in house and topped with vanilla ice cream. Be sure to order this at the beginning of your meal as it takes an hour for them to prepare. Oh and on birthdays they send you home with the menus that have ""happy birthday"" printed at the top.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The service could of been better. Our server missed a lot of things but he always made sure to personally check on me to make sure that I was having a great dinner since it was my special night. I really appreciated that and it made all the thing that went wrong seem very small. All of the food and cocktails were delicious. My friend order a side of the mushroom truffle butter for her steak and OMG it was to die for!!! I literally stole it from her and dipped everything I could in it.

29,ApbNxkBEczf1zVY5RHaLqw,Xenia M.,1.0 star rating,"The Chart House is probably one of the most overrated restaurants I've ever been to. This establishment was highly recommended to me for my birthday dinner, and I'm sad to say they disappointed on many levels.Firstly, you would think that a restaurant of this caliber would provide toilet paper in the ladies bathroom...Wrong! It was an inconvenience just to get some toilet paper, which already set the tone of my experience here. Secondly, my fiancé requested to have ""happy birthday"" displayed on my menu. However, that was not the case, my menu appeared blank. Alright no big deal. Our server, was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the food. So we decided to start off with the wicked tuna trio, which was just OK, nothing special. For our entree, my fiancé ordered the salmon, and I ordered the spinach gnocchi with shrimp and scallops. My scallops were cooked perfectly. However, my gnocchi tasted like rubber. I could barely chew it. The salmon had a very strong over powering flavor of mustard. So strong, we couldn't finish the meal.When asked if there could be anything done to fix this, the manager said he would comp our champagne and give us dessert on him -- Great! When we received our bill, we were charged for our dessert, which was promised by the manager to be taken care of. This led to a hassle of back and forth between the waiter and manager, taking up our time.I also found it interesting that two tables who sat next to us also returned their food back to the kitchen. Not to mention, the food here is ridiculously priced. You pay for the beautiful view! Everything else is garbage.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I ordered the Ribeye that came with ""garlic mashed potatoes"" and my girl had the only chicken option on the menu, and I could not believe how bad the ribeye steak was, I felt like I was eating school lunch. Even the side of garlic mash was terrible, I didn't think you could mess up garlic mashed potatoes. For apps, we had the calamari and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was pretty good but the calamari had a very fishy taste to it which was very unusual. Idk maybe it was a bad batch but it did not taste good at all. The chicken dish was decent at best. We also had a side of the creamed spinach which just tasted terrible. The only thing that tasted amazing was the bread that they gave us before our food.And last but not least, the dessert. We had the lava cake that everyone was raving about and honestly it was wayyy overrated. It was a decent lava cake, nothing special at all. In fact, the one from dominos tastes 10x better. Overall, the food at this place was just not good at all.

31,UXCPmnMfwIjuXhBvtZRIEQ,Allyssa C.,3.0 star rating,"Meh.My fiance and I went here for Brunch on a Sunday to celebrate closing on our first house. I had been here once before when my sister was considering the Chart House as a venue for her wedding so let me be the first to admit, the view is gorgeous, and you are definitely paying a premium for it. Unfortunately, the day that my SO and I came, it was extremely foggy and you could barely see the first row of buildings on the other side of the river. So this review is focused purely on food and service.I had never been here for Brunch before and didn't realize until we arrived that there wasn't an option to order from a menu. We ordered drinks (choices of coffee, tea, and juices) from our waiter and waited there for a bit before we saw others going up to the buffet. The waiter brought us our drinks and explained where the line formed for the buffet.We then proceeded to stand on line for about 15-20 minutes. The buffet selection was sufficient but not stellar. Most of the food was typical buffet food with runny scrambled eggs and floppy bacon. The only hot food stations were an omelette station with pretty limited options, and a carving station with beef and pork. The food tasted good but nothing was ""OMG"" good, in my opinion. I personally hate eating cold food that is meant to be hot so I was definitely disappointed. In addition, it was freezing in the restaurant that day so by the time we got back to the table my coffee was cold. Once we finished, it took a bit for us to flag down a waiter for our check. And once we paid, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for him to come back with my card. Don't get me wrong, the waiter was extremely friendly and apologized, but it was clear they were under-staffed that day. Overall, I will definitely come back on a clear day for dinner, but brunch did not do it for me. As I said, you pay a premium for the view, and $39 per person for brunch is definitely a premium. When there is no view, it tends to be a lackluster experience. Definitely won't be back for brunch.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

34,232xdmoVvdRJ6d8wAa_yUw,Adebunmi S.,1.0 star rating,"Yesterday, March 3 2018, my Fiance and I hosted our Bridal Proposal Brunch which entailed asking some of our close friends and family to be in our wedding party. 17 people attended the event and our bill was $1109, $1309 with tip. This event is the second large group event that we hosted at The Chart House in Weehawken, first event was when my Fiance proposed to me in front of our friends and family (a total of 23 guests with a bill nearing $2000). I am writing  because I was interested in having future bridal events at Chart House like a rehearsal dinner and bridesmaid brunch, but given the way our night visit ended yesterday I highly doubt that it would be in our best interest. Yesterday my fiance and I gifted all of our wedding party with jewelry and beauty items. One of my bridesmaids forgot a Coach gift bag at the establishment. The bag contained a Coach wristlet ($75), a Michael Kors watch ($275), and 2 Sunday Riley beauty products ($150). A total of $500 dollars. Because she and the rest of the party had also received a gift box with other items, four hours passed between when we left the establishment and when she noticed the gift bag was missing. During that time I was not contacted by a manager even though my name and number was on file. My friend and I both called to inquire about the bag and was told that a manager would contact us.My friend went back to The Chart House, that same night, and after some delay a manager brought the gift bag out from a back office. The Michael Kors watch was missing from the bag. The manager was unable to tell my friend who found the bag and why an item was missing from the bag.The manager (Bill) also stated that the reason why he did not contact me was because he didn't know if the bag was empty or not. By the weight of the bag, it should have been clear that there were items in the bag.I am concerned that:(1) A bag was found and the manager did not attempt to contact the party associated with the bag(2) The manager explained his negligence by saying that the reason why he didn't call was because he didn't know if the bag was empty or not.(3)The manager said he didn't know who found the bag, another sign of negligence.(4) An item was missing from the bag and he did not ask his staff about it. (5) The manager spoke very rudely to my friend and showed no interest in following up on the missing item nor was he apologetic. He repeatedly stated that there was nothing he could do about it. An establishment that large, which is part of a larger company (Landry) needs to have routine procedures for handling lost items. At the very least, the party on reservation should have been contacted regarding the item. It seems to me that the manager and his staff were going to wait it out and claim the items.

We always start with oysters that are always fresh and great.This time we also ordered the korean fried calamari and the only Korean thing about it was the name. Drenching the calamari in sweet chili sauce don't not make it korean. The calamari was also overcooked and rubbery. We ordered more starters like the gazpacho and more shrimp that were okayWe also ordered grilled salmon and grilled cod with the crab topping and it was really only okay.. it wasn't worth the price The service was good but it is really slow.

We followed the hostess toward the window view tables and she attempted to seat us in a corner far from the view. Perplexed I politely asked to be seated in the middle to get a better view of the city. She proceed but seemed unnerved by my request. To be frank I had the option of choosing between 10-12 tables along the window at that moment (example of how empty it was at that time). However by 7:30 the restaurant was filled. Our Dining experience was wonderful we had a lovely gentleman as our server by the name Scott! Scott was a fun and gave us great recommendations. The food was very well worth the wait and the appetizers were equally delicious! The manager Bill came to our table periodically to check on us, he too was very kind and accommodating.

I was awaiting a special occasion to finally come, and when my aunt celebrated the milestone of the Big 50, I immediately thought of this place. We arrived here for our 6:30 reservation, we were seated immediately as the restaurant wasn't very crowded at this point. One of the most impressive things about this place is the views from sitting by the water. However, after Labor Day that don't allow you to sit outside anymore due to the weather. Fortunately, there's no such thing as a bad seat in the place. I know that term is often overstated, and exaggerated, but that's really the case for this restaurant. Also, once it gets dark you get perfect skyline views and excellent photos for social media.Collectively we had the following food items:Caesar Salad-- 4 out of 5. Not too many croutons, which I'm not a fan of. It's a relatively large salad for $9Lobster Bisque-- didn't try, but my aunt raved about itCalamari-- didn't try but everyone else did and loved it. However, they did mention its deceptive as it appears you have a plate full of calamari, but it's an illusion. Crab cake-- we were all stuffed and it was taken to goFilet-- 3.5 out of 5 the steak was ok, but lacked flavor and needed to be seasoned better. The meat was very tender and was cooked to perfection.Mashed potatoes-- 3. Out of 5 the potatoes tasted like boxed mashed, you know the ones you cook on the stove and are a little lumpy. Most steakhouses have above average mashed potatoes, but these were subpar. Prime Rib-- I had a small piece, but as it was rare, it wasn't my style.Lobster Tail-- I didn't try, but my cousin enjoyed it. 30 dollar up charge from the prime rib. Flounder-- 4 out of 5 prepared well and would recommendLava Cake-- we were all stuffed but since I read this was a must, especially for birthdays-- I only tried a small piece and it was alright. Takes 30 minutes to prepare, so order well in advanceQuick summary for the food: the food was slightly above average, but I've surely been to much better steakhouses. If I were just rating the food this place would be three stars, but they overcompensated in the areas of service and ambiance which brings them to a four star rating.Ambiance & Service were excellent here. I included in my Open Table review about my aunt's birthday, and while you would think all restaurants note this, they don't! Chart House was excellent about and the hostess, server, manager and another employee said happy birthday. They prepare a specialized menu for the Birthday person which you can take home that's wrapped in ribbon. The server was constantly refilling water, checking on the table, and making sure the Birthday girl was good. While he checked frequently, he seemed to always do it at the right time, and not in an annoying fashion. My sole negative was I felt like I was here for restaurant week and they were attempting to get you do everything with an up charge. Also, they try to get you to purchase a membership card similar to Del Frisco's, which is beneficial if you come here frequently, but I passed on it. Ambiance was excellent as well. Ive spoken on the great views already from inside. Outside on the little deck is even better. Many friendly out there who you trade taking photos with and have a quick laugh. You can't go wrong with the NYC skylight in the background.Thank you, Chart House for the hospitality and giving my aunt a wonderful birthday. We all enjoyed it here. Lastly, it's not overly expensive for three people the bill was about $300 bucks.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Shrimp Tacos had a great blend of crispy batter and cabbage, fresh pico de gallo and kimchi with creamy jack cheese; every bite was a texture sensation! The ahi nachos had a really tasty tuna and wasabi cream but the wonton was really hard and tasted stale. Prime rib sliders also had a delicious mix of rich prime rib and jack cheese, sweet caramelized onions and a creamy but zingy horseradish sauce. The au jus dip really brought out the beef flavor!Service - 4/5. The entire bar/lounge area is used for happy hour which all have good ambiance. They are really packed even for a weekday but the service was still timely and professional.Value - 5/5.

While our waiter was very patient and efficient other things weren't all right. When we sat there was a dirty dish on the table. While we were still eating appetizers the main course came and they took away the dish with couple of calamari that my husband was still eating. We felt little rushed. I asked New silverware but they never brought it. So I had to take a knife from the closest empty table. The view is amazing and it's too bad that the service isn't the same. The food is average good. I found the salmon way over cooked while my husband really liked his steak. They have a good selection of wines.

I mean the service is still great but the food took a little turn. I came here with a party of 10 for a birthday dinner. Our waitress was very accommodating and knew how to deal with the big party. We ordered two bottles of wine to start and  I wasn't a fan so I ordered a Malibu bay breeze which was great. For the appetizer, I went with the fried calamari. That's when I noticed the first downfall, they must've changed up the recipe of the dish. The sauce now comes all over the calamari instead on the side and I also think they overdo the sauce just a bit. For my entree, I ordered the herb crusted salmon and that was good not excellent but okay. A guest in our party order the prime rib and said it lacked a lot of flavor. Another guest also had two strands of hair wrapped into her mashed potatoes. Despite that, I still went ahead and ordered the mash potatoes and let me tell you they are honestly so good. So rich in flavor and just the right amount of everything. For dessert, I had the apple crumbs. I would say that was a 4 out of 5. If they didn't add in the berries it would have been a 5/5 but nonetheless still very good and filling. At our table, we also ordered two of the house chocolate lava cakes. And they were both great.Served with ice cream and a rich chocolate sauce. I've been a fan of this restaurant for so long but it has been going downhill. I don't think I would go out of my way to make reservations personally but if ever invited for a dinner, etc I'm all there for the mashed potatoes.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

There were a few fish platters ordered and some appetizers which all looked amazing, and i was told were fantastic. Each dish is plated nicely and is a perfect presentation. We ended the feast with 2 chocolate lava cakes which were mouth watering. The cake was great and you just break into the middle and the chocolate starts flowing, delicious.I ordered had ordered a cucumber gin cocktail that came in a separate serving container (it was meant for 2) it was great! Their signature cocktails and wine by the glass are reasonably priced and they have a vast selection. Everyone was extremely happy with all the food, no complaints.Atmosphere:A contemporary design, looking newly finished with clean lines and fancy art this place is very cool inside. Huge windows separate you from the river leaving you with a gorgeous view of the NYC skyline which is memorizing. They have outdoor seating which could be nice during the summer. The bathrooms where very clean which is positive. I loved the vibe of this place, nothing feels cramped at all with huge open ceilings and a great floor plan that flows.Service:We had an awesome waiter named Kyle (great name, just saying) he was very responsive and extremely professional. The food came out very quickly even thought the place was relatively full. He made some great wine recommendations as well as food, very knowledgeable. Can't ask for anything else!Overall, this is a wonderful place that i would highly recommend. It is a bit expensive but for a date night, or a night out for celebration this is the perfect place.

I will give them credit where credit is due, the waitstaff was excellent, views are great, and main course and desserts were good.  However, I have to rate it 3/5 stars as the seafood tower was our appetizer and set the mood of disappointment for the rest of the meal.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Of course, the warm bread and butter doesn't hurt.I think where this place falls off a little is with the service we received. It was slower than we thought.

We were a table of 8 and unfortunately we had to wait an hour to be seated with a reservation.  We have frequented this restaurant 2 times previously and we were happy, but nothing went right last night.  The waiter brought over our drinks and water.  My husband's appletini was not good even though he gave specific directions on how to make it.  They replaced it with another drink.  We waited a long time for cut lemons and ice for our water. We constantly had to ask for more water and ice.  Also a straw never came.  Our salads were wonderful and definitely large enough to share.  The shrimp cocktail appetizer came out and our friends were delighted.  Then we all ordered our entrees.  Most of us got steak and told him specifically the temperature we desired.  When it finally came out, my husband's prime rib was RAW and my filet was well done. My friend's prime rib was mostly fat and inedible.  My other friend's Steak Marsala was so puny for $30 and she counted only 3 mushrooms.  Our side order of mushrooms came out sizzling and burnt.  They took back the steaks and redid them but my husband's prime rib came back rare - it should have been medium - they took it back again.  What should have been my medium rare steak came back rare also and they took it back a second time.  They replaced my friend's fatty prime rib with a better piece.  It was 11:30 pm, already and we were waiting in that restaurant since 7:40. Did I mention that we were celebrating a 45th wedding anniversary and a big birthday?  We made these reservations back in July.  We ordered our coffee and only 1 chocolate lava cake.  To make up for this fiasco, they delivered 3 chocolate lava cakes and charged us for 1.  It was delicious but most of us do not eat chocolate late at night so it was left over.  We did have to order the lava cake ahead but the waiter never brought over a dessert menu to see if we wanted a different dessert as well.  After expressing our disappointment in a nice way to the Manager, he totally understood and adjusted the bill in a big way. He also handed us his card and clearly said that he wanted us to call him over the next time we came back so that he could make sure our experience was better.  Of course we still gave our waiter a nice tip because most of these errors were caused by the kitchen.  If we do go back, it's because the Manager did the right thing and of course we want to see the most amazing view in the world....the NYC skyline.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

So my review is about our actual meal and service. Four of us arrived on an early Sunday night, and it was 80% filled. We made a ressy for 4:30pm and was promptly seated. Our waiter was half-assing our orders and clearly was just a very bitter person. I don't remember his name, but I would name his Mr. Grumpy - he never smiled and brought our food out late (food was quite cold) and the drinks also took some time to get. We waved him down a couple times and asked him to take a picture of us, to which he reluctantly agreed (I could've sworn I heard an eye roll). The food was fine - I ordered a grilled salmon which was a bit dry for my liking but the side yukon+sweet potatoes made up for the lack of flavor of the salmon. My caesar salad was well-tossed and nicely presented (and it was huge!). We each had a glass of vino and happily finished the dinner with some dessert. The dessert was MEHHHH - I had the raspberry sorbet which was soooo sweet - I only took one bite. It's a nice place for a date or group gathering since they have larger tables and booths, but I wouldn't be coming here just for the food.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

He was great with suggestions and coming around to see how we're, without being too over eager. We ordered the seafood tower for two and it was perfection..fresh seafood, fresh oysters and perfectly seared tuna. The mini Tabasco bottles were so cute!

Food- half dozen blue point oysters, chopped salad, New York strip with truffle butter, pan seared chicken, crab cake and the chocolate lava cake for dessert- all perfect.  The steak was cooked exactly how I asked for it- pink throughout, red in the middle.

Our view was obscured by their steel beams they have supporting the windows go we had to do a few leans left and right to see outside. Food was decent, we started off with the clam chowder and hummus spread. Soup was just average, nothing fancy Hummus spread was plated very nice. not bad for the price. Dinner came and honestly, We both had better elsewhere. We got the short-rib and chicken, and this is where it gets to me. Both had the same side dishes. Nothing to compliment the unique taste of the dishes. Just mash and 2 stalks to asparagus. And dessert was the cheesecake, which to both of us taste just like cheesecake factory bought.Now this is where it tops the cake, and why i give this establishment my 1 star and wont be coming back. The server was indeed friendly, but when it came time for the check, he had circled  the tip portion of the check insinuating we leave him a certain amount. not based on his service skills, manners on how the service was addressed, just a blank circle around the tip. Now i also work in the food industry and showed what he had done to my own bosses, and they laughed and said if ""Our staff did that, we would fire them on the spot.""

Parking can be a bit of a problem esp on the weekends at night. The only problem is they hardly have any veggie options other than a couple of salads, a few sides and a hummus tray. But you want to have a nice drink or 2, and enjoy the view whilst having fun conversations with friends or loved ones this is the place to be. For people who love seafood there are tons of options. Some interesting ones like the chilled 5 shrimp app which looked really cool even for a vegetarian like me. The one thing i do want to have the next time i'm there is their Lava cake with Ice ream which they make fresh as it takes 30 mins to prepare. Dont kid yourself, chart house is pretty expensive. A couple of drinks, an app or 2 and an entrée can easily cost $75 per person. But like i said, the view is awesome.

The person who was at the main desk in the front seemed sort of rude, when we asked for a table next to the window her tone was not proper a all. Service was very slow, when we would ask for something it would take the waitress forever to get it for us. As for the brunch; it felt more like a sea food lunch buffet than brunch. There were a few pastries, bagels, toast, salad, omelet station, some assorted cheeses and salami, a whole table with different desserts, lots of sushi and shrimp and an entire table with different seafood entrees.  There was no cream cheese , the French toast was really hard and dry I had a hard time cutting it with my knife! This brunch is good if you are a seafood lover though. I was really excited about Sunday brunch here but was not expecting such a selection for brunch!! It felt like a lunch buffet with dessert and omelets! If you eat a lot of the seafood items it's worth it i guess but if you're not a seafood lover like me it's pretty pricey for what you are going to eat!

It's a massive amount, good for 4-5 people honestly. I've always gotten the steak here. Definitely one of the best steaks I've had. Their drinks are very good too. I'm not huge on tasting that alcohol flavor, as college ruined it for me. But the way they make their cocktails, make it enjoyable for me. For dessert, we ordered the creme brûlée sampler.

Very mediocre. They even fucked up fresh oysters. Let me count the ways...- Oysters on the half shell: The oysters were weirdly rubbery, and they also did not taste briny at all. What the hell? I felt like I was eating wet and mooshy erasers.- Chilled lobster and shrimp spring rolls: DO NOT GET THIS. There is practically no lobster or shrimp inside of this. It's primarily cabbage, pretty damn disappointing.- Kimchi calamari: Ok, so this was tasty. It was tasty in a way that cheese fries is tasty - deep fried, battered, crispy, savory and spicy... It supposedly came with fried vegetables but I think it was just funnel cake coated in delicious sweet and spicy sauce.- Sweet and spicy grouper: This was decent. The fish was cooked well, although it was a small filet. The coconut ginger rice was steamed appropriately and had a fluffy texture.Service wise, there were hits and misses. They printed special menus for our table that was celebrating a birthday, and the food came at appropriate intervals. As the night progressed, service got a bit spottier and waiters took a longer time to refill our waters and such.Overall, I think back to The Water House on 30th St and the East River in Manhattan, which also suffered from similar issues (beautiful view but mediocre food) - I think The Water House had better food.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

He asked us if we wanted to sign up for the rewards program but he wasn't pushy about it. We actually ended up signing up because of all the great benefits he told us about.The manager was so happy that we enjoyed our meal and loved the place so much that he gave us our dessert on the house for my birthday. It was a beautiful night and Chart House outdid themselves. We will be back for every anniversary, birthday, special occasion. Can't recommend this place enough. Also, I think our servers name was Nathan or Nathaniel, not completely sure but he was the BOMB.COM!!!",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

128,nthLJ9vuA3nOw3eORGDMTw,Alex Y.,2.0 star rating,"I get that they have a nice view, but that alone just isn't cutting it with me...Walked in around 7~7:30 pm and found seating at the bar in a reasonable amount of time. Bartender was warm and welcoming.  Drink selections were good and the cocktails were not overly sweet. Considering the price point, it was slightly above average and certainly enjoyable with the view. Had the crab cake appetizer to start. It was probably the highlight of the meal. Taste and texture both very good. The only thing to note is that the portion is on the small side. However, to think that the portion would be overly generous and filling at an establishment like this would be to think that the Easter bunny would be bringing you whatever presents you wished for at Christmas. (You've basically got to be completely delusional and all sorts of messed up...)The entrees were meh. I returned the first fish entree (barramundi) because it was just flat out bad. It had this breading on it that made Long John Silver's look gourmet. If it wasn't for the bartender and how he handled it professionally, they would've gotten even less stars. Second entree attempt was the sole/flounder, and it was slightly better since it wasn't breaded like a brick. But by then I just wasn't into it anymore. Just to note, they cooked the shit out of that piece of fish. The chef must have seen the color turn white, then proceed to cook it for another 10 minutes just out of pure spite. Sorry fish. You gave up your life in vain. 0.5 star for view. 1.0 for service. 0.5 for that crab cake.

Presentation of both dishes was fantastic, Taste and preparation were also spot on, tasty, cooked to proper temp and memorable.Grace Lane Riesling with the main course. Good wine selections. Nice thing about fresh fish selection is that you can have it prepared any way you like, pan seared, baked, blackened etc. We had the Halibut, baked with a Cabell topping and we had a stuffed flounder.

I recently became vegetarian, so I am exploring my options with fish dishes and usually I don't like fish but I have to say that this fish was delicious and perfectly cooked. The peanut sauce on the side was very tasty, I actually wish that it came with more sauce.  He ordered his steak medium and he said it said it was a little more on the well side but it was still delicious and perfectly cooked. I'm not giving five stars because of the service.Our waitress seem to be a little under the weather and was dropping things and seemed a little flustered but she did bring us everything on time and we weren't waiting around for a long time. We just expected a more elegant and collected server paying over if we're paying over $40 a plate.We shared a coconut shrimp appetizer and it was delicious I actually wish I ordered an entrée with that just so I can have more. The view is unmatched it really has a great scenic backdrop. I wish that they had more options on the menu besides strictly seafood and steak because I would come more often for dinner, maybe some more vegetable dishes or more Asian  fusion.

Most steakhouses have an old school, guys only vibe to them that don't make them the greatest option for a romantic date night or a shared special occasion.... but then there is Chart House, sitting perfectly on the end of a pier in the Hudson River with one of the best views you will ever get at a restaurant!   The view is insane and it's pretty hard not to get a great view of the skyline from almost any seat in this restaurant, it will wow any date you bring there so for the guys it's a win win (great steak, and your girl will be awe-struck). The steaks are excellent, most notably the prime rib which is the best reason to go here. My girlfriend also enjoyed the filet mignon. I will say being a steak guy there isn't a tremendous amount of options, which is part of the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, but the prime rib makes up for that in my book. We also ordered mango sticky rice that was straight up not mango sticky rice and was honestly just bland.. but other than that our appetizer and dessert was excellent, as were the cocktails.     Overall, go here for a special occasion because they will make it feel special and whoever you bring won't forget how amazing the view was and how magical the whole place feels, even if it's a little pricey it's worth it.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I guess there's that.  The appetizers were okay.  The molten lava signature dessert was okay.  Everything was just okay.The view:  The view was beautiful.  I loved the view.  It was very romantic.  However, my fiancé and I had requested a window seat and waited an extra 40 minutes for the ""window"" seat.  We ended up not actually being seated by the window but we could see the window.  So, I guess there's that.  It was a nice view of the window but it wasn't actually next to the window like we had expected.  I guess Chart House and we have different definitions of ""window seat"".The service:  It took a while for the waiter to come to us and whenever he was with us, everything felt rushed as if we weren't his priority.  He seemed very nice but just frazzled with the craziness (it was extremely busy).The valet:  Loved that guy that got our car.  The guy who brought us our car was pretty swell too.The bar:  Yummy drinks, good service. All-in-all, the high price you pay for the food is not for the taste of the food, it's more for the nice view and the experience of Chart House.  If someone told me, ""Hey, Chart House is doing a pop-up.""

159,rrtEm09rNvxtOG7Z_optpg,Dexter V.,4.0 star rating,"What do you call a restaurant that sits on a pier on a river that divides a state with one of the most famous cities in the world?  Well Chart House of course.  While others may not agree with me, the location of this restaurant is the best in the Hudson Waterfront.  The view in the daytime and especially at night is to die for.  New York City's beauty truly comes alive as soon as it gets dark and the myriad lights all come out to play in the city that never sleeps.  So coming here for the first time truly warranted pictures upon pictures to capture the beauty.  But another thing was captured the evening of my visit--and that was my stomach.  This restaurant served up one of the most delicious seafood dish I've had in quite some time.  A memorable experience and a gastronomical indulgence make this place one of the top places to celebrate a special occasion.With more than one hundred eighty degree view of the city across, the meal at Chart House better be as good.  Thankfully it is.  I started the experience with a no-frills, simply executed shrimp cocktail.  The large shrimps were perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce accentuated the flavor of the shrimp, not overpower it.  Next was a round of typical dishes that didn't leave a mark but was nonetheless flavorful.  An order of Caesar salad and complimentary pasta dish left me full and worried if I would not have room for the entrée.  Thankfully I was able to move my stomach around to make space.  My dish of choice was their stuffed flounder.  A perfectly cooked piece of fish stuffed with crab drizzled with lemon shallot butter reduction and served with mashed potato and green beans wowed every aspect of my palette.  There is something to be said about a primarily seafood restaurant that can serve good seafood and such was the case with Chart House. More often than not, a restaurant that offers up incredible views fall short of offering even better dishes but Chart House truly hits it out of the park.  As far as I'm concerned I have no qualms about making a return visit here.  Although prices are steep, there is nothing to complain about the value of the experience and the dishes that come out of the kitchen.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

My husband said, wear a nice dress, we're going out!We arrived and parked ourselves but there is valet if you choose so. I'm not sure the price. We entered and it was beautiful. You get a panoramic view of the city and the waters. It is dim inside and fake candles everywhere. We gave our name at the front desk and they said a few moments please. The bar looks beautiful. There's also a spiral staircase that goes up to the second floor but we were seated on the first floor. We sat down and i saw my name on the menu! It said happy birthday! That was a surprise! I ordered the filet and that's where the star deduction comes from. First, I got a lobster bisque and it was good, like a 7/10. Has some small chunks of lobsters in. My husband ordered the calamari which was better than I expected. He also ordered the stuffed flounder which was also pretty good. The mash potatoes has the skin on them. My filet, btw I eat filet everywhere, it was not as I expected. The sauce was sour.  Also it tasted grainy. Usually when I eat a filet, it melts in your mouth and is smooth. I get medium rare btw. The steak was just not enjoyable. After, we got the lava cake dessert. It takes 30 minutes to make so order ahead of time. It was good. Not like the best I've had but still pretty good.

Very accommodating and they ask if you are celebrating a special event as well. Best views of the city and staff and service was amazing! Since it was my first time there, I asked for recommendations on food and drinks and our waiter was so happy to help! If you love seafood, this is the place to be.

One of my friends and I both had the Crimson King Salmon. It tasted very good BUT there was nothing KING about it for $40 we should have received much more than what we received. Both the salmon and the sides that accompanied it. The drinks were ok. Had the chocolate molten cake for dessert....thumbs down. This place is nice and the food is just good (no one at the table raved about that dinner) I feel it is overpriced for what you get.

171,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,1.0 star rating,"What happened to this place?! Last time I came here, I absolutely loved it, this time around it was awful. I made reservations with my family for my birthday and they were kind enough to sit us by the windows which was really nice. The waitress came by and asked if she could get us tap or sparkling water then disappeared for 20 minutes. When she finally came back, we ordered some sparkling water and martinis. Again, the waitress disappeared for the next 20 minutes. Our drinks finally came and we told her we would get started with the Kim Chi calamari and the crab stack. The Kim Chi calamari wasn't bad. I would order that again, the crab stack was eh, not great. I enjoyed the avocado and mango, but the crab on top was terrible. I couldn't even taste the crab they put so much mayo with it. Gross. In the meanwhile, we ordered a bottle of white. I specicially asked her for a Kim Crawford Pinot Grigio, she failed to mention it was a Pinot Gris, not Grigio (huge difference). Honestly, I don't think she knew 1 thing about wine.For dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Cabell on top. The lobster and lump crab were decent and the only tasty thing on my plate. The fish was terrible. $40 for frozen fish, no thanks. I love Chilean Sea Bass, It usually melts right in my mouth and is flaky and delicious. I think this piece of fish was over cooked and I'm almost certain it was frozeb. Additionally, there was hardly any sauce that came with it. The sides were rice, almost straight from a box, and steamed vegetables with no flavor. I used to think this place was high end, I don't think that anymore. My boyfriend had raw tuna and he could barely touch it, it looked disguisting. He also said the fish was cold as was the rice. He barely touched his food. Honestly, we should have complained at this point, but the service was so terrible and I didn't want to embarrass my brother, who hates unnecessary attention,  so I didn't bother.After the horrible entrée, all I wanted to do was leave. We had been there for far too long and I was getting fedup. The waitress finally appeared after what seemed like hours and came over with a melted mud pie saying ""Happy Birthday, this one is on me"". While the gesture was sweet, the ice cream was almost completely melted, it was embarrassing Furthermore, she mentioned at least 3 times that the desert was on her. Okay lady, you're clearly looking for a nice tip, we get it.All and all, extremely disappointed. I won't be going back anytime soon and I'll be sure to tell people who tell me they're going there on a date not to bother.

Both tasted excellent. and we did get bread within 5 minutes of sitting down.The manager (Hans) came by to introduce himself and was very cordial and nice.For entrees - we had 2 carnivores in the crowd which opted for the fillet mignon. I repeated the swordfish and the wife had the chicken.The chicken was excellent as it was the first time. My swordfish on the other hand - tasted much better. It was firm yet juicy and was not burned. I was impressed.The steaks were cooked just to order.Finally desert - was the lava cake with a dedication.

So me and wife usually go to chart house whenever we have some big occasion to celebrate. We must have gone 3-4 times in past 2 years and always had a great time. So last Thursday (11/10), we went to chart house to celebrate the purchase of our first house. Kyla our  waitress was very nice and after initial chit chat she asked if we were celebrating anything special. So we told her about it and she was genuinely happy for us. After a delicious meal she surprised us with a coffee cake with cute decoration which we really appreciated. My wife was all smiles.And finally when we asked for check, the bill on he check was dollar 0.00!! Some family who were sitting besides us had paid the entire bill for our food drinks (easily $150). We were stunned and did not know how to react. Kyla mentioned that some family had asked her about us and they decided to pay the entire bill. My wife and I will make sure to pass along this gesture to someone else in near future.So this experience was worth remembering. Highly recommend this place!

The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars is because, when the servers took our orders they asked if we wanted soup or salad. The problem with this - the way they worded it, we were all under the impression that either was an option included with the meal. Nope! We were charged extra for each person (because everyone ordered one or the other).I felt that was totally dishonest on the part of the servers, boosting an already high bill. We ordered about 8 bottles of Malbec, as well as cocktails, appetizers and dessert, so we had a very nice bill.

As you walk in, the spiffy upscale scenery meets you as does the polite staff. A big thank you to the staff for allowing us to still dine even though we showed up late  close to the kitchen closing time. We also got a window seat which you should definteinly request if available.The  appetizer was the hummus & guacamole  served with plantains and pita bread; excellent start to the meal. The filet medium well for my entre was delightful and well prepared with excellent texture.  With recommendation from a friend I ordered the lava chocolate cake with ice cream and I will certainly  be thanking them for it. That thing is heaven sent and everyone should try it though their dessert menu is extensive and I'm excited to try others.Now the view is what brings people here and it is amazing especially at the window table. You can also go outside along the rails to get an outside view (there's also seating there as well i imagine available on weather appropriate days). You get a great show of new York and the water surrounding.I would definitely go again and it's a sure stop for anyone at least once to enjoy a great meal and view to match.

We got seated by the window, but that was before I asked for him, so that could not have been from him, and nothing was taken off our bill.To make matters worse, my prime rib was awful - I ordered medium rare and it was well done.  It had no flavor and I have this really bad feeling it was from the previous day (I have no way of verifying this, but I just get that feeling).  I did get violently ill that night and really that is the only thing I ate that day that could have caused it. The rest of my family's food was good and no one else got sick. I should have sent it back, but I was trying not to make a scene on my wife's birthday.The thing is this, no one needed to call after the first experience - but if you do call and make promises, make good on what you promise.  At least come out and speak to me.  $25 in free food was not the reason we went, but will be the reason we don't go back soon.  And that's the shame",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Granted by the time we received our apps CH became crowded but that's no excuse. Service should match the elegance of the restaurant, on point and thorough.We started off with the Lobster Bisque, Crab Cake, Kim Chee Calamari, and the Shrimp, Crab, Avocado Mango Stack. The bisque was creamy although the lobster meat was not heavily present. The calamari was just okay, nothing to write home about. The Shrimp, Crab, Avocado Mango Stack was colorful and full of mouth watering surprises. It was chilled with the perfect accompaniment of sweet and flavorful spoonfuls with each bite. Entrees consisted of Filet Mignon, Alaskan King Crab Legs, and Baked Stuffed Shrimp. The sides were the Yukon Mashed Potatoes, Steamed Asparagus, Creamed Spinach, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Everything was presented nicely and tasted amazing.They even surprised us with two Hot Chocolate Lava Cakes that said ""Happy Birthday"" to my Auntie.

I wish I remembered her name :(For an app, we went with the Mediterranean Hummus Platter, since my boyfriend doesn't eat fish. My favorite was the Roasted Red Pepper. Went perfect with the Pita and Plantains. The wine she recommended (a California Cab) was the perfect balance of dry and light. For the main course, she recommended the Mac Nut Mahi. I was between that and the Chilean Sea Bass, so went for the recommendation. It was nothing short of amazing. The peanut sauce was not too overwhelming and the crust was the perfect amount of crunch. The fish was cooked perfectly. The Bok Choy was tender and the Purple Sweet Mashed Potatoes were DELICIOUS (made with coconut milk) with the soy sauce on the side!!My boyfriend ordered the NY Strip and he enjoyed it. The Grilled Asparagus was also cooked perfectly. I wanted dessert so badly, but was so full. The waitress sent us a desert on the house anyway. Obviously, I ate it even though it was gluten and dairy filled, BUT oh my goodness was it amazing. Oreo crusted coffee ice cream with a chocolate hazelnut sauce. Need I say more? Can't wait to return when the weather is nice and sit outside!!",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The food and service were exceptional too!  I had the pleasure to dine at the Chart House with some co-workers while attending a meeting in nearby Newark.  Our reservation was at 7:15 so our drive to the restaurant kind of sucked.  Traffic at that time was crazy.  Tons of busses heading to NY for shows and people getting off work made it pretty much stop and go the whole way.  The ride home was much nicer! The great thing about the 7ish reservation was that we got to watch the day turn to dusk and eventually darkness.  The city just lit up over the Hudson as nighttime came.  The restaurant has big picture windows and they all face NY.  They also have a deck for outdoor dining which was also perfect for pictures.I ordered the middle size Prime Rib which was pretty big, and priced just under $50.  It came with potatoes, any other sides were extra.  It was made exactly medium rare (as ordered) and the horseradish sauce complimented it perfectly.  The group shared chocolate lava cakes for dessert.  I would suggest 3 per cake at best.  We ate for over 2 hours and never felt rushed, even though they were busy.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

With much thanks to Yelp, it was! After reading all of the great reviews, we took a Lyft to Chart House, which is basically located right on the Hudson River (you'll see what I mean once you check out the view!) as promised, it was spectacular. The lit up skyscrapers in the horizon were breathtaking! The restaurant was constantly busy, and it was surprising being that it was a Wednesday night. However, our server was very attentive and he did not fail at making sure that our night stayed special. He was honest and made great recommendations as well. I had the Mac Nut Mahi, which was a crusted Mahi  with some sort of peanut sauce drizzled over it, topped with some sort of mango garnish. Pretty amazing! But I did have to question if it was worth what I paid for it. My boyfriend had the Steak Pesto Pasta with a side of coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was amazing and my boyfriend loved the pasta! I thought it was good... not the best I have ever had, though. Again, probably not worth its price. All in all, we had an amazing experience at Chart House! I have concluded that there is definitely a charge for the amazing view that's added to the price of your food. It was worth it though!

I always make reservations for dinner when coming to CH. This particular visit was very random but I knew we would be able to eat at the bar without a reservation. Once we arrive, the bar area is packed and the outside has an hour wait. Two bartenders told me they don't handle tables so find a waiter which I thought was a bit rude. I eventually track down a waiter and he's extremely nice and tells us to hang out. The waiter sits 2 other couples before us who arrived after my group so I was extremely pissed. I make that known the best way possible without getting rude and waiter was very apologetic. We eventually get seated and I start to get the service that I'm accustomed to at CH.Besides the turmoil of getting seated, our drinks & food were good. Note to self & to others, definitely call in a reservation. Without a reservation, you'll probably experience the same. It's a great place for drinks & fine dining but dammit make a reservation lol.I'll leave another review when I visit again with that reservation but this particular visit was a 2.5 but was saved at a 3 because of our waiter.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Walked into chart house just as they opened for happy hour we were asked if we wanted to sit by the bar or outside in the lounge, we thought let's sit outside since it's nice outside. Our waiter rich was very attentive. I had asked if they could make chicken tacos on the menu instead of fish, Not only was rich kind enough to ask the cook he brought out delicious tacos. I recommend this place to any foodie who's interested in having a cocktail and some delicious appetizers go to chart house ask for rich he will bend over backwards for you.

For the (my gander) %5 of ""locals"" who stop in, my initial question remains. Now a waterfront locale is no joke and the architectural investment is indeed felt in nearly every seat...breathtaking views.  Once the menu comes though, that's where the effort stops. The service feels rushed, in execution (we received our appetizers and entrées as if ordered ahead) but effort less so (if asked, our waiter was on point on each item, no qualms).   The food, ugh.   We are at the $30 price point here so this is where my ""view"" question hits home.  If you haven't figured out by the lack of ""wild"" vs ""farmed"" distinctions, the lack of an open kitchen where most fish are mislabeled, or just by what arrives on you plate, all you taste is the subtle feeling of being ripped off.  I can add $3-5 to my ""daily catch"" because I'm enjoying the view but here I feel there's an extra $2-5 I can't explain by what arrived on my plate. Cocktails, not bad but, again, the view commands your price.  If you have a standard go with it. Don't try their specialties, unless yours is a rum and coke.  In that case you'll love this place, and don't listen to me (except John F). The beer selection (3 drafts) is pitiful and $6 valet parking is pushing it.

Now, we all know that expensive doesn't always mean good food, but that's not the case at Chart House! We had a range of fish and steak plates chosen, and everything was delicious! Last, but certainly not least, our waitress, Holly, was unbelievably nice, courteous and patient. She took the time to explain the menu and in no way she made us (and by that I mean me) feel rushed when I wasn't sure what to order because everything sounded soo good! The only downside was that we wanted a table by the window. However, because we were a party of 6, our table was a bit further but we were still able to enjoy the view.

I had the cheese plate since I don't eat a lot and didn't feel like being tired after dinner. He got steak that came with a few other things , which was extremely delicious.

Also at the end they gave us a postcard of the view from the restaurant.The chocolate lava cake was amazing.  REALLY REALLY good. cake was sweet and fluffy, the chocolate inside was gooey, and the ice cream was cold and crunchy. It was a perfect way to end the night. The service was also great.Those things being said...DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE FOOD.over-rated, over-priced jersey food.The appetizer portions are huge. We got the avocado, mango, crab meat stack. That's the name of it, and that's what we got. Separate ingredients stacked on top of one another with nothing tying the dish together. and not very well seasonedThe kimchi calamari was good. Lots of extraneous fried things, but good overallThe menu looked great. There are so many options of fresh seafood, it's too bad that it's all covered with cream. So much unnecessary creamThere was mahi, tuna, grouper, flounder, chilean sea bass and you can pick it pan fried, grilled, butter/lemon and 3 different toppings.We picked the lobster/crab topping and the shrimp/avocado toppingInstead of clean flavors where you can see and taste the fresh fish, they were covered in oily cream toppings. you couldn't even taste the fish. Which fish did we order? didn't even matter because it was smothered in cream.The autumn grouper over parmesan risotto was the same. The flavors were just so muddled you couldn't tell what you were eatingI got the stuffed flounder. it was acceptable.

The place is beautiful. The ambiance is romantic or just smooth, maybe both. Put for this occasion it was a time to relax and celebrate. Only knock is the wait. We literally waited and waited to be seated. I have no idea why the wait was long but not cool because my party had a 5 year old, so didn't want to ditch them and go to the bar.       When we were finally seated it felt great. I mean just to take in the views the lighting, the vibe was awesome. First thing you notice after sitting down is the setting.    Service was great. I will tell yea there was never a question that I had that did not get answered. They even personalized the Menu to say Congratulations to my buddy for him nailing the USMLE.What was ordered....Panned Chicken -It was good but nothing to brag home about.Steak - was great, the best Steak I have had in this part of NJCoconut shrimp was greatCrispy shrimp was nice and flavorfulchicken with fries was goodMushrooms were a okay, was expecting a little more out of it.The portions on the Crispy shrimp was smaller than I expected.Overall great Restaurant.

When we complained about it to the waitress she immediately offered us a free dessert. To us, this was not even close to making up for a 40-minute wait and only showed this happens often and they have a ""band aid"" prepared. But we didn't say anything focused on enjoying the night.Later the manager came to our table, apologized for the wait and said the appetizer will be on the house too.

Silly us.  We soon discovered most of the seating in the restaurant is situated to enjoy the view of the river.  The place was very busy with general dining on the first floor and wedding reception on the second floor.  Sound quality is excellent in the buildingl, as we never disturbed by the celebration one floor above us.As with most prix fixe menus, there were selected appetizers, entrees and desserts to choose from.  I had Caesar salad and my wife had the gazpacho.  The salad was as good as any I've tasted, but the gazpacho was the standout, cold, fresh, and full of flavor.  The entrees were the spicy Mahi-Mahi and short ribs.  Both were very good, but the short ribs were slightly better. They were rich, beefy and tender beyond belief.  I noticed the short rib entree on the regular menu has a side of spinach gnocchi, while the prix fixe entree had Yukon gold mashed potatoes. As much as I like gnocchi, I think the potatoes were an good substitute.  We both had the strawberry cheesecake for dessert, which, frankly was somewhat mealy and tasteless, but we were too full to care anyway.Our only regret about going to the Chart House was how long it took us to get there.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

We didn't do valet and appreciated that it wasn't mandatory like other snobby places.This place saves a lot of $ on electricity because the lights was very dim. I feel for the older generation that dine here. It does accentuate the NYC skyline. We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer and the soup sampler. I ordered the berimuundi (sorry for spelling) with the sweet and spicy sauce and my Boo Boo ordered the NY strip.The coconut shrimp was ok the batter was still soggy with oil. The soups were a tasting of the clam chowder, bisque and gazpacho. I liked the chowder the best biut it wasn't the best chowder. The bisque need more salt and the gazpacho tasted like chunky salsa. My entree was not great. I also lacked salt and it seemed like they poured lumpia dipping sauce sauce on the plate and rested the fish over it. It was a sweet and spicy sauce but not what I was expecting. Boo boo's steak was very well done but needed more of the gristle and fat trimmed. I think they want to present a bigger steak. We also shared the lava cake that we preordered when we ordered our entrees.I think for the $$$, I was expecting more for a more memorable meal. But, the service was exceptional. Boo Boo liked our waiter's accent and made me tip more :PIf Boo Boo was Happy then we would come back. But, we got a similar view to the people fishing outside enjoying their smokes.

292,qqZM4vwWXQjXmo2ytKQCcg,Michelle C.,3.0 star rating,"I have been to the Chart House several times, and am a member of their rewards program. On my last visit, I made a reservation for 4 people on a Sunday at 6:45. My husband and I were treating my parents to dinner. On this particular day, there was no parking, so we opted to use the valet service which was a hot mess. They had people backed up down the entire one way lane and only accept cash, which was causing even more delay. First tip: accept cards for the valet or a pay online feature through an app. Even though we had a reservation, we were made to wait 20 minutes because our table wasn't ready.  A bit annoying, but alright. We finally are seated and the waiter takes forever to take our drink order. I specified that one person in my party is gluten free due to Celiac's, so guidance on which plates he could eat are necessary. They completely forgot about it. Overall, drinks were good (I had the mojito flight), food is just ok, and we didn't eat until about 8pm. We did get the seafood tower and I asked the waiter if a small would suffice for 4 people. He recommended the large (of course, it's a $100 app compared to $50 for the small) but we got the small instead. To our surprise, the small was more than enough for 4 people. I do not like a dishonest upsell. The seafood tower didn't seem to be the freshest and they didn't provide butter or hot sauce for the crab and oysters - it was also bland and I do not recommend it. The calamari was also disappointing. There are much better options in the area in the same price range. It's the view which is alluring and unbeatable. I understand restaurants get busy (I worked in the food service industry for several years), but when you have an upscale clientele, you really need to get it together and provide an exceptional experience.

My cocktail drink was a recommendation he made and it was a great choice. I started with the shrimp, crabmeat appetizer, followed with the lobster bisque,  and for my entrée the crab legs. My waiter made a second recommendation to pair my wine which complimented my entrée.  I was so delighted. My birthday dessert was the chocolate lava cake, and while it was very rich, it was good.

Since I've dined here before and had a good experience I thought why not give it another go. My husband and I order the calamari app and lobster bisque soup. For our entree we ordered the filet mignon with a side of spinach with the chocolate lava cake as a dessert. My food was decent and prepared as requested (despite the long wait). My husband on the other hand was disappointed. He took one bite of his steak and didn't eat anymore. It was extremely dry and over cooked not medium rare like he ordered. I advised him to send it back. However, he has a serious fear about something bad happening to his new order upon sending back an incorrect order. So he didn't make a fuss of the situation. He did mention to the waiter that the steak was inadequately prepared. The waiter said that unfortunate and that he put in the order as given. He asked if anything else was needed. My husband advised no. One other person received the wrong order but it was corrected after a bit of a wait. We were advised to put our dessert order in with our food order so that it will arrive in a timely fashion. The entree took approximately an hour to arrive. We literally still waited  approximately 20 minutes after our meal before our dessert came. Other than that everyone else didn't have any problems with their meals.

During the sunset you can see the sun reflected on the buildings. So romantic! Our server greeted us and said happy birthday to my boyfriend. He also showed us our menus said ""happy birthday"" on them, which was really nice. We ordered the hummus tasting for appetizer & it was much bigger than we expected but SO good. For entrees we got the filet mignon & the shrimp with scallops. Both were delicious & fresh. The portions were on the smaller side but that's to be expected at such a nice restaurant. We were actually happy they were smaller because we were stuffed from our appetizer. For dessert we got the lava cake, which takes them 30 minutes to make. It was amazing! I had a delicious cappuccino as well. They also have a wide selection of alcohol & some very interesting drinks. We got a whiskey infused with cherries  & cinammon, which was presented in a nice manner for 2 to share.Service was great. We were constantly checked on & given suggestions.

We always make reservations and this year we specifically asked for a free standing table, not a booth. With 8 people attempting to get to the buffet, a round booth really doesn't work. When we arrived, we were lead to a booth... my dad was then told ""we don't guarantee seating."" Oh. Ok. No.We were eventually seated in an area which would normally be three 2-3 seater tables, with a booth on one side and chairs on the other. This was fine, especially since we didn't let them put the three tables together. This way, anyone could get up and out when they pleased to get more food.We're finally settled and are asked about coffee and drinks. I ordered a mimosa at 11 knowing that they couldn't serve it until noon- Jersey law. We all went up and got food.The food was fine. Not great, but mostly good. The carving station meat was better this year. The coffee was awful, most didn't even drink it. The mimosa was good, though. Later two cappuccinos were ordered and those were not good either.

Situation in Weehawken, this place has one of the most beautiful views of the New York City skyline and unlike most views, you can see practically the whole skyline horizontally and majestically in front of you. Absolutely breathtaking. After you've caught your breath from the view, you'd be sorely mistaken if you didn't order the lobster bisque soup. Creamy, with pieces of succulent lobster swimming around, this soup is by far one of the best I've ever had. Also try the calamari, which is sautéed with bell peppers and tossed in a kimchi sauce that's out of this world. Main course: now I know that since this restaurant is on the water, you'd think all they'd have is seafood. While their seafood menu is extensive, I opted for the 18 ounce Callahan Cut Prime Rib. One bite and you're in heaven as the juiciness of the meat take you into another universe. The prime rib was complimented with garlic mashed potatoes and horseradish sauce, but our table also got accompaniments of Gorgonzola risotto, creamed spinach, and orzo medley. All quite delicious. For dessert: look nowhere else than their classic and famous Molten Lava Cake dessert. Does warm moist chocolate cake made with Godiva chocolate topped off with vanilla ice cream covered in Heath chocolate pieces sound good? Well it tasted ten times better than it looked and it looked like something out of a magazine that was too pretty to eat. All my other dinner companions loved their food, the NY strip steak was a big hit as well as the linguine with shrimp. The service is beyond helpful as waiters came often to check on us and how our food was and if we required anything else. My water glass was never left empty.

Now this place is a bit on the pricey side so I expected more food than what was actually served. Everything was fresh and there was no imitations.

The hostess promised that we would be seated as soon as the rest of our party was there. My date and I went to the bar to order some small appetizers and drinks. We ordered Oyster on the Half Shell and Chilled Lobster and Shrimp Spring Rolls. Once the rest of our party arrive, we were immediately seated. Our server, Kyle, was super pleasant and shared with us the details on the menu for the food items we asked for. For appetizer, my friends ordered the Wicked Tuna, which was sooooo good!  As a group, we ordered creamed spinach and mango sticky rice.The others ordered Red Eye Shrimp and Scallops, Lemon Herb Crusted Salmon, Spiced Ahi. FYI, I tried a bit of each of their dishes. For my own entree, I ordered the Blackened Swordfish with Avocado Pico to top it off. The dish comes with a rice shaped as a small pyramid and carrots and broccoli. The sword fish was so tender and the relish on top made it even more amazing.Ambiance was great. While there were other tables chatting away, the noise level was still decent to where I was able to converse with the rest of my party.

Entrees we ordered were 14oz strip steak and 3/4 lb of king crab legs for me and pan seared mahi for my wife.  It was delicious and plentiful so needless to say we had leftovers.  To end the night we enjoyed the lava cake with homemade peanut butter ice cream(with a special message written to us in chocolate syrup around the plate).  I really feel like I need to recognize the two people that made this night an incredible one.  Marsha our waitress was so professional and fun.

There are four pieces of big sized baguette pieces topped with cheesy mushroom and shrimp; very delicious. My boyfriend had an 18oz prime rib - it was very good, however I've had better in the city. It was paired with a yummy helping of mashed potatoes. I had the seasonal special of the Shrimp, scallop and bacon slaw. I finished the entire plate with some slaw left over. It was tasty, something on the dish was sweet and I think it was a bacon jam? I would have preferred the dish without, but still everything was good!

They have valet parking but you can also self-park in their lot. We came here for a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't too busy. After a little snafu where the bottom of a glass cup spontaneously fell off, allowing ice water to flow out onto the pants, the waiter and general manager were very nice and apologized profusely. We switched tables and everything was smooth from there. We ordered the lobster and shrimp roll, which had a nice sauce and Asian flair. I do kind of wish there was more lobster and a little bit less going on in the roll itself to let the seafood shine - but it was very good. I thought about ordering a shrimp entree but opted for the fish tacos ($13) instead. The blackened fish was OK but perhaps a bit overcooked. It didn't feel very light (though it had some avocado slices on top) like the best fish tacos taste but hey. It came with thin fries, which were fine as well. We also ordered the Captain Prime Rib ($47), a thick piece of steak, cooked and topped with a bit of lobster and served with mashed potatoes and sour cream. For dessert, of course, we had the chocolate lava cake (it takes 30 minutes to prep, so we told the waiter straightaway). It's a very rich dessert and very chocolatey - the interior is warm and you definitely need the vanilla ice cream as a pairing to offset the chocolate inside and outside of the cake. I've been here once before and I would say I enjoyed the food more in the past but it was probably because of what I ordered. The entrees are probably the way to go next time! The entrees run upwards of $30. The server was attentive and seemed to come along every time we needed something.

I was very surprised that he can back with deserts and began to just set the plates on top of all the mess !

372,QzHS3Lw393UZqvYTZ7Vh0w,Dulce L.,2.0 star rating,Decided to try the Chart House today for Sunday Brunch.  We made reservations and did not have to wait to be seated which is one of the reasons i gave them two stars.  We had a very long walk from our table to the buffet itself.  We were very disappointed with the quality of food.  The smoked salmon had grey edges.  Maybe it wasnt fresh?  Who knows.  The shrimp was not peeled and very small.  Another disappointment.  We are use to Waterside Sunday Brunch which has excellent jumbo shrimp.  The Prime rib was unchewable.  I guess i just i created a new word.  Tough and inedible.  Decided to try a small canolli. The crust was soft.  Just not good.  Their coffee was worst than gas station coffee.  Totally a let down.  Never again.  I hope management sees my post.  You have a great location.  Please  serve quality food for Sunday Brunch.  This is not the Golden Coral and you are not charing their prices.,Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

They don't accept reservations to sit by the glass so show make your reservation earlier than you want to eat. When you get there tell them you want to sit by the glass. Be prepared to have a cocktail or 2 at the classic old school feel bad they have. It's worth the drinks at the bar to sit with the fabulous view of the city.

I say okay and as I'm walking away, I think 'why would I order an app if people are paying their bill?'Every bartender was oblivious, obnoxious or rude.  2 of the 3 ignored me and when I got the attention of the 3rd, he starts his alpha male bs.  'You can't order here. Walk to the other side of the bar' he barks at me. Where he had asked me to go I was yelling my order over the heads of other patrons. I ask what beer you have in bottle and he rolls his eyes at me.  Thanks jerkface.  I decided not to get a drink and just sit and wait instead.  Everyone from my party has showed up and it is now 8:10.  We ordered drinks in the lounge (with a waiter who was awesome) and it is now 8:20.  A person in my group says she is hungry.  I asked the lounge waiter how long would it take for an appetizer to come out. He recommends we just wait. Then he asks for the reservation name so he can check how long it is going to be. He comes back and is now recommending we get an appetizer. So we get the app.  It was the Flight trio. The pinot nior was old, the chardonnay was oaky yet buttery and pino gris tasted delicious and had a nice balance. It also came with fish tacos, some bruschetta and something else. I opted not to try because they were small and that person who had ordered it was really hungry. It is now 8:45.  Why am I waiting 45 minutes for a reservation I made weeks ago?  Finally after an hour the buzzer goes off and we see the hostess. I hand her buzzer and she is just looking confused. She asks for my name again, what time the reservation was and how many people. Ugg, get your shit together. Someone is finally now showing us to our table.  As I am walking through the dining room, I notice 5 or 6 empty tables besides the one we were seated at. Why?  Why did we wait?The waiter hands us the menus and is going over the specials when another hostess comes over and asks for my name. After I give it, she apologizes and says the other hostess made a mistake seating us. Unbelievable! I said yes she did make a mistake because we waited an hour to be seated for our reservation.  She repeats herself and I do as well and she finally understood what I was getting at; we were not leaving this table.  Not after we waited an hour, not after I saw 5 more empty tables and certainly not after your mistake. She awkwardly smiles and walks away. I finally get to order and here is what I think.The bread that comes when you sit was great. An added plus that the butter was soft.The lobster bisque was great. Very silky and velvet-like. I would order it again.The short ribs were good but not great. They were a little too mushy.The shrimp scampi was overcooked and was tough and rather small.The creme brulee was the highlight of the entire meal. It was made fresh and had a nice crunchy top layer from the sugar. We also got the raspberry sorbet and that was very good as well.After such an exhausting process, I really didn't get to appreciate everything I would have liked to. One of the more disappointing parts of the night was a table by the window that could seat four was left empty the entire night. My party could have sat there. Also disappointing was seeing someone in the bathroom dressed in mesh shorts, a wife beater and flip fops. I have no idea if they were a patron or employee getting off of work but there really should be some type of dress code at these prices.

The lobster bisque was a bit too salty and was not creamy enough (for me) and my boyfriend who had tbe clam chowder said the same for his.For our entrées I had the coconut shrimp with crab friend rice, and it came out cold! The shrimp had great flavor but I think if it was hot I would have enjoyed it better. My bf ordered the filet mignon and he said it was only okay. We also ordered the cream of spinach and Boston Markets is wayy better ! I think the best part of the dinner was my Margarita that was delicious and refreshing! And the chocolate lava cake which everyone was raving about was okay too, the applebees one is way better for me! It came a little cold.Overall, the waiter we had was amazing he was very attentive and even had to exchange our cake because it was brought out with peanuts and my bf had an allergy.

My partner and I made the decision to celebrate our anniversary at the Chart House earlier this September and we were excited to hear our hostess tell us that the restaurant provided couples with a free dessert for their anniversary. However, once our server NATHAN found out we were two women celebrating together, his attitude shifted. He seemed reluctant to provide us with the complementary dessert, and when he finally admitted that they did serve it to couples, we asked him to please make sure it didn't contain nuts as I am allergic. He came to our table several times during our dinner, and each time I reminded him gently about my ALLERGY. When our meal was over and our dessert came, we found it COVERED IN NUTS. Nathan returned to our table with a smirk and asked how it was.

She was surprised by the magnificent view you get from New Jersey looking back to the Manhattan skyline. It's really gorgeous when the city lights come on as it turns to night. The food wasn't bad, but for a seafood restaurant I was expecting more fancy seafood options. Their selections weren't anything spectacular compared to other seafood restaurants in the city. The crab cake was nice and not over fried or falling apart. Overall, the food was good but not memorable. The price tag is a bit high for the quality of food.The service was great, fast and attentive. Short wait for a table to open up even with a reservation. Normally I would deduct half a star for any delay with reservations but the waitstaff was so nice and pleasant that they get one star for the waitstaff. Food was okay and I liked it but I don't think it's brag worthy means only one star is added. The view you get from the restaurant is top notch and really sets a romantic dinner environment, another star. Their hot chocolate lava cake was delicious and about the best part of the dinner. They also helped customize a message for the anniversary. Another star gets added for the dessert. I can see myself coming back in the future but only on special occasions or events.

I went to the hostess and announced my name and reservation. We waited for our table and while we were waiting 2 other couples arrived and were seated before us. After 10 minutes of waiting another person asked if we were checked in. I told her we were already checked and the original hostess was on the phone and was fumbling around with a small table receipt paper. She seemed either too occupied or didn't care. We were finally seated and the one who took us to the seat apologized .Long story short , the food, and the view were fantastic.

Staff, including hosts at front and manager, seem harassed and overworked. Service is as expected for a place that commands relatively high prices, but this most likely is because of the river view. Parking is not easy if one chooses to park their own car. Disabled persons access is terrible (long ramp, so a long walk for someone with a cane and/or a long ramp requiring a second person to assist in wheelchair access). Disappointing given all the ""good"" reviews.

Hans, the general manager took care of it and took care of us. Nothing but professionalism. Our waitress from a previous dinner remembered us and kept on checking on us to make sure we were taken care of. I love to arrive a little earlier, sit at the bar, and order a fancy drink. The bartenders are top notch, friendly, very good at what they do. The brunch is a little pricey but well worth it. The food was delicious and got my money's worth. When we had dinner, our appetizer was their shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and the cocktail sauce was perfect. We both order filets and they were perfectly cooked medium. Delicious! Mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus were awesome. We order a bottle of Pinot Grigio, it wasn't too expensive and was excellent. For dessert we shared the hot chocolate lava cake and another time we got the key lime pie. It was delicious. Another great Landry's restaurant.

So much so that I was thrilled at the prospect of heading out to Weehawken to experience this restaurant by the river that has such amazing food. And then I got here. The table wait was a cool 10 minutes, which is a perfect amount of time to belly-up to the bar for a drink. We sat and chilled. The Bartender was like an incoherent, uncommunicative slug, slithering from one end of the bar to the other, leaving a wet mess wherever he went. To avoid having to look at him anymore than I needed to, I ordered a simple Bourbon on the rocks. Pour it and get away!Soon enough, we were summoned to our table and given a window seat, as promised. Thank you for the commitment to fine service. Sitting by and looking out the window, I noticed the type of seating they have outside on the patio, which is beautiful by the way. They have iron tables and chairs patio furniture. This seems to me to be out of place for what's supposed to be a 5 star restaurant. I would think they'd have better furniture for those people who want to sit outside and enjoy the weather and view at a restaurant of this caliber. This is what I first thought until I tasted the food.The recommended Calamari with Kimchi was a disaster in texture and flavor. The fish was fine and the prime rib (for a place that was known as a prime Prime Rib spot) was eh. The place? Beautiful. How can it not be? It overlooks Manhattan.The service? Good.The food? Mediocre at best.Before writing this review, I reread the reviews on Yelp and realized that many of the folks who gave this place a good rating were here for a party. I guess when a place like this focuses on generating an income and building a reputation on parties, the a la carte customers can go eff themselves.

Their coconut shrimp, kimchi calamari, spinach salad and ssamjang shrimp were all great, but the sauce they served with their sword fish just tasted so off. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, but the cream had gone just a little bad or was churned one too many times or something. We ordered three starters and four entrees and a bottle of wine and the tab was a little over $500 including the tip, which wasn't terrible.

I didn't expect to get seated at exactly 8:15, almost an hour and half later is ridiculous! The next complaint was the temperature in the restaurant was FREZZING! I had my jacket over my shoulders and my teeth were still chattering. I really couldn't wait to get out there and turn the heat up in my car!To start we had the Kim Chi Calamari, which was tasty but I'm not sure there was kim chi in there or just deep fried squash.   For out salads,  I ordered the Orange Avocado Salad and my BF had the Chopped Salad, I didn't finish my salad, the dressing was terrible. My bf seemed to enjoyed his chopped salad. For dinner I had the Grouper ( $32.00) and he had the Halibut ( $40.00) We both ordered the Cabell topping  ( $9.00)which was lobster and lump crab topping. At  total of $41.00 and $49.00 total for the  entrée I would have expected MUCH Better. I have been to smaller establishments with better tasting fresh fish. Oh and lastly I had the most horrible indigestion that lasted from 12:20 am when I finally got home until 7:30 am.

our reservation.  She tells me that they have a bunch of parties eating dessert and that it should be another 15-20 minutes.  I head back to the bar where at 8:45, our bartender Ramon asks me to give him my last name so he can go check on the reservation (the bartenders were doing this for everyone).  He comes back, says they're working as fast as they can and apologizes (we start to contemplate leaving and going somewhere else).  9 p.m. hits and Ramon comes to offer us a free appetizer on the house.  We ordered the Wicked Tuna appetizer, it was awesome.  Honestly one of the best if not the best tuna appetizers I've had.  It comes with 2 small pepper seared ahi tuna tacos with a cajun coleslaw and spicy sauce, 3 more slices of pepper seared ahi tuna with avocado over cajun coleslaw, tuna tartare and plantain chips.  Awesome flavors and amount of food.  As we're eating our appetizer, Ramon sets two drinks in front of us and says ""on the house"".  At this point, we decide to stay.9:35 p.m. we get seated for dinner.  We let the hostesses know that the only reason we stayed was because of Ramon and the bartenders.  At this point I made sure to let our waiter, Dave, know that it was my girlfriend's birthday and that she has a sever nut allergy so nothing with any nuts.  We order the Thyme Fire Roasted Shrimp appetizer, Peach-Bourbon glazed Scallops and Shrimp and the Basil Citrus Grilled Mahi.  I also let Dave know that we would be wanting the Lava Cake without the heath bars (nut allergy, heath bars contain almonds) and that if they wanted to write happy bday with her name and put a candle that that might not be a bad idea (something you'll see plenty of pictures on here for).  After we place our order with Dave we get a visit from Hans, the restaurant manager.  He addressed me by name and wanted to thank us for our patience and wanted to apologize.  He let us know that it was due to all of their large parties that got there at 4/5 staying 4-5 hours.  I wanted to ask him if that was the first time they've had large parties on a Saturday night (or ever) but I didn't see any purpose in that.  I let him know that I had heard it was a good place to come for occasions and a view, so I brought my girlfriend here for her 26th bday.  He asked her her name and told us he would make sure that the night was special for her.  I assumed that this meant picking something up off the check or who knows.We get our appetizer, the Thyme Fire Roasted Shrimp, which came with savory herb relish, frisee, avocado & lemon salad, served over remoulade sauce.  It was very good, but not great.  Unique and refreshing flavors that complimented each other nicely.A few minutes after our appetizer, our entree's came.  The Peach-Bourbon Glazed Scallops & Shrimp were very good as well, but not great.  Again, great flavors going on with the different sauces and vegetables, but nothing that would make me want to get it again.  My girlfriend liked the Mahi but again, nothing great.  The lemon scented rice, green gazpacho relish and rich tomato coulis complimented the fish perfectly.  Again, the flavors are great but the food quality is nothing special.  After our entree's, our waiter Dave stops by to let us know that the manager wants to pick up our dessert.  I wanted to ask him if they typically pick up dessert's for people's birthday's (which most restaurants do), but at this point I was tired, had enough and just wanted to eat and go home.  Again, I reminded him to not include the heath bars.Our dessert arrives....with heath bars all over it.  I point to them and he says ""oh right"" and takes it away.  A few minutes later, it comes back with no heath bars, no happy birthday writing and no candle.  We eat the lava cake, which was really good and then we left.  What a horrible experience, definitely the worst dining experience I've ever had.  I'm an extremely reasonable person, but being seated 2 hours and 20 minutes after your reservation is downright unacceptable.  Bartenders were the saving grace, will NEVER go back.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Not great, not outstanding, not better than I've had at most medium to high price range restaurants. My date was glad he got his filet done medium instead of his usual medium well, because it came out medium well anyway... He wasn't too fond of it. My seabass was not bad. Again, nothing exceptional. I could have made it at home. The appetizers were okay. The shrimp and lobster spring rolls each had a jumbo shrimp, I didn't notice much lobster.. A few teeny tiny pieces (think size of a pinkie in all the rolls combined). My margarita was tasty. The server lady was pleasant and very professional. There is a dimly lit bar area also, with a lounge feel, which has some small tables with couches as well. I like the food at the Crabhouse in Edgewater much more - this applies to both the seafood and the steaks. The only reason to come here is for the romantic ambiance. Don't come with high expectations as to the food.

I would tell anyone coming to NYC or Northern Jersey to just go to the restaurant for the spectacular view. We ordered the seafood tower which was good. But my biggest disappointment was the strip steak an earlier reviewer listed the steak as livery. I have come to understand that my perception of a good steak is my last good steak. I have a great butcher and can get a great aged filet that can rival most restaurant. One of the best steaks I have ever had have come from the Homestead, and the Ruth Chris IN CHICAGO (there is a difference) and my butcher seared in a cast iron pan with rock salt. I say this to say that the steak at this restaurant was not very good and I think they should reconsider their provider, as it could be the local shop-rite. As I said overall a good experience.

You can tell he takes pride in his job, just as the cooks obviously do. The food; I can't even put into words. To share we decided to try the lobster bisque. It was so well-balanced and had such an amazing flavor. My fiancé got the 14oz prime rib that basically melted in your mouth. I had the panko breaded chicken (heaven); we also had asparagus that was cooked to perfection. José also recommended me a tasty Chardonnay to go along with my meal which paired perfectly; my fiancé loved his margaritas! For dessert, we chose the delicious strawberry cheesecake; which José brought out with a candle and a card for our celebration. This was such an amazing experience.

It can often become very frustrating when checking in for a reservation, ordering a drink at the bar, or simply trying to hear your date during dinner. Chart House gets packed during the weekends. It is inevitable that you will be seated very close to another table and initially think to yourself, ""Wow. Too close for comfort."" The bar is often full and you usually have to wait to be seated due to a line of other people waiting for their own reservations. Having said all of this, Chart House does the most professional job possible keeping everything in line for its customers under these circumstances. The bartender was conversational and friendly despite having his work cut out for him at the bar. While it's a busy atmosphere, it never quite feels like chaos is lurking. Our waiter was incredible and very friendly. He was prompt and alert as well. As for the food, the ribeye and crab were both cooked to perfection.

It was either Chart House or no celebration, so 15 of us decided to make his wish come true. I have heard absolutely amazing things about this restaurant from acquaintances so I was very excited to try it out. I started off with the Mango Mojito. It was great! Tasted amazing and refreshing. I got the Moscato sangria as well and that was really good too. For appetizer I ordered the calamari. It wasn't bad, but I've had much much better. They didn't bring any type of sauce with it which was strange. One other person ordered the crab mango avocado appetizer and said the crab tasted really bad. The birthday boy got the shrimp and lobster spring roll...it was one piece of shrimp with cabbage which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. My biggest disappointment -  i ordered the NY Strip. I asked for it to be cooked ""medium"" and it came out well done. It tasted like the steak I buy at Wal-Mart. I was absolutely heart broken that I spent 37 dollars on a steak and couldn't enjoy it. I've had better steak at Langhorne. I dont write a lot of reviews but I had to write this. Chart House, it is ridiculous that you cannot cook decent food, especially for the price. I would rather make my own steak and sit by the pier in Weehawken than visit you again.

But I was very disappointed we had a 3:00 resavations and  as we were walking to the restaurant from the parking lot . All I could see was a beautiful view of the Manhattan Skyline. As we started getting closer to the restaurant. I could smell a awful stinch smell we look to the right side of the restaurant close to the water. There was bags and bags of garbage lined up high outside. I know it's a restaurant and they are going to have plenty of waste . But a least have a garbage dumpsters with lids on it to close the lids when throwing away the waste and keep it out of sight from the customers . The smell was so bad that as we enter the restaurant front doors you can smell the garbage still as we walked through the door and walked up the stairs. Okay we stopped at the front desk to confirm our resavations and there were several ladies standing there. So one lady asked how can she help us and we told her that we had a 3:00 resavations she looks at her computer checking. And said I don't have anything here with that name for 3:00 resavations so we applied by saying the resavations was just made a couple of hours ago . So she said ok well she did something which I don't know what and said ok give us a few minutes. So we are standing there with every one else waiting. And I was checking out the fabulous view but at the same time I just was not feeling comfortable about this place. And thinking about that smell outside what is the meal going to be like . So a family friend had already asked why didn't we make resavations at Capital Grille . 15 minutes go by and I said ok enough let's leave so I never got the chance to sit down and order anything. But sometimes things happen for a reason we left and went some place where I was so happy with and very satisfied in every way!  I going to give Chart House three stars because of that fabulous view.,Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The food was cooked well but, when I'm paying money, especially 4 or 5 star prices, then I want food that is top notch. I want fresh baked croissants or muffins from the kitchen and not typical NY/NJ processed breakfast baked goods. All in all, I felt like we paid  and ate well, but a lot went towards paying for the location more than anything.

We began with a couple of cocktails at our table which were delivered promptly by our waiter. We wanted to take our time and we were in no rush to order our food and the waiter accommodated us.  Before our appetizer we wanted to order another cocktail, and we asked to split a Martini, something we've done very many times in fine and not so fine restaurants alike. Our waiter told us he could bring us one and we could do whatever we wanted with it. Really? He brought our Martini in one glass. Maybe he thought I was asking his permission for two people to drink out of one glass. Very unusual and a first for us.The appetizers arrived and while they looked very nice they were not memorable. We both ordered one of the specials, and I asked if we could have a wine paired with our meal. The waiter asked us if we like white or red wine. Ok, so they don't have a sommelier and they don't do pairings. My meal turned out to be a cold entree, something that wasn't mentioned on the specials menu. Cooked fish served chilled. I returned it and ordered another special, which was very plain tasting. My girlfriend ordered a side that tasted like over salted frozen food from the supermarket. My side of asparagus was plain with a few bread crumbs sprinkled over it.My girlfriend hit the nail on the head when she called the Chart House an expensive Red Lobster.

481,svFycHjXZYpNVutZ_0_gDQ,Jessica W.,2.0 star rating,"You absolutely cannot say anything badly about the view, this chain restaurant picked the perfect location. They get an A on that, but the food is less than stellar not to mention the below average service.I've been here for dinner and the brunch buffet. We had a reservation for dinner and we were waiting 25 minutes so we decided to eat at the bar. The scallops were good, everything else we ordered left room for improvement. The bartender was really attentive and everything came out fast and as it should have, and he kept refilling our drinks. I hate being thirsty while eating, so I was very happy. The brunch brought this place down to two stars from four. The brunch is a big spread but the online menu boasted about 3 chef prepared salads and there was only one, and the leaves were wilted. Also, we were not told the buffet ended at 3, we would never have purchased the brunch at 225 if we had been told that. It felt like we were intentionally misled, and that's never a good feeling. Being that it is a buffet, the only thing the wait staff has to do is clear the plates and bring drinks over. I had a coffee and I had to practically waive my napkin to get a refill or the waiters attention to remove the dirty plates from the table, since we had to rush eating before they closed the buffet. While the cheese was nicely presented and some of the dishes were good, it was a horrendous experience and I haven't been back since and probably won't. For me the brunch gets half a star rating, the bartender that first time gets four, since I can't give halfies I feel justified rating the Chart House a 2.

For our meal, we started with the seasonal Autumn salad. A delicious choice with kale and vegetable ribbons perfectly tossed in a light champagne vinaigrette and topped with candied walnuts and goat cheese. For entrees we chose the Chilean Sea Bass simply grilled and the Prime Rib. Both were prepared well and rather tasty. Portion sizes and accompaniments where on point. To cap off the dinner we had the signature Chocolate Lava cake for dessert. This is NOT to be missed and was a sweet treat we will remember and are certain to crave in the near future.

For the entrée my boyfriend had the shrimp scampi, my mother had the coconut salmon, and I had a whole lobster, with steak. The steak was not as good as a steak house, but good to be a seafood center restaurant. Everything was delicious including my son chicken and French fries. For desert we had the New York cheese cake with caramel and it was also very good. The drinks were perfect not too strong, but also you can tell they were not water down.

I sat down, wonderful view of Manhattan but I don't care about views I'm here for the food.  I ordered rib eye medium rare. I specifically asked the waiter is this a grilled steak or is it cooked in the oven like a roast beef. Miguel the waiter said it's cooked on both sides. Noooooooo it's wasn't. It was roast beef and it was medium. I don't send shit back because some shithead in the back will just spit on your food or dicksmack it so I said fuck I'll just eat my roast beef. The mashed potatoes sucked. The drinks were ok the cappucino sucked, was that folgers? The calamari was good.

It was a brand of Champagne I do not recognize, but perfect for breakfast.Tip:  View is worth half the price of the meal since the restaurant juts out into the Hudson River.

I made a reservation for 10 people for brunch several months in advance and noted the special occassion via open table. I confirmed via phone as well. When we all showed up, we were forced to use the valet as the valet was hoarding spots near the entrance and beyond. We had to wait for our table and when we were told it was ready, we were brought to a dirty table and had to go back and wait. The hostesses did not have their act together. We were eventually crammed into small circular table which was difficult because it was a buffet and four people would need to slide out anytime someone needed to get up. Waiter was overwhelmed. The special occassion was not acknowledged at all. Food was ok but we were disappointed overall. Not what I expected. When I received the survey, I expressed my opinion and was contacted by the manager, who assured me that this was not the norm and that he wanted fo make it right. So, he invited my daughter back for dinner and sent $125 gift card to cover the cost. She showed up yesterday and there were 30 cars waiting for the valet because there were two weddings and no regular spaces. She had to wait 1/2 hr past her reservation time.

Seated to two glasses of my favorite wine, crab cake appetizers, and for entrees, we got the 9oz Filet Mignon with Yukon Mashed Potatoes, and the Lobster Tail with grilled Shrimp.

However i had an engagement party to attend so i had no choice but to return. We were in the upstairs room to the left, and my goodness the views were breath taking! Especially at the night time, the city really lights up.We walked in and on the left hand side of the room was a Mediterranean buffet table. This wasn't our main meal, but just a few pick at items. This was the best part of the meal. They had falafels, greek salad, calamari salad, babaganoush, chicken and spanikpoita. There were other items but these were my stand outs. You would of  thought you were eating at an authentic Mediterranean restaurant, it was that good. There was a bar located inside of the party room and the bartender was quick to serve, but didn't have much of a personality as i remembered. Ok now this is where it goes down hill......The set menu was 3 courses. First course, arugula and spinach salad with cherry tomatoes and oranges. Nope, that was wrong. The salad that was given was arugula with mandarin oranges DRENCHED in a balsamic. It was beyond wet and basically not edible.For the main. Chicken piccata or mahi mahi with mango salsa. They were both losers. The fish was dry, the chicken was boring. The mashed potatoes were heavy with the butter. There was no flavor with anything.Dessert was a chocolate lave cake. Everyone at the table said it was good, i just don't really eat desserts so i cant give my opinion.The service was the main reason im giving 3 stars. They were on point! Constantly taking away any dirty plates. Refilling drinks promptly. Doing so with always a smile. They were eager to please.Ok so the service and the view get all the stars of this review, but seriously avoid the food.

And to worsen everything, they brought out their signature dessert without any note for my mom's b'day (i had clearly requested them to do so).

Although the restaurant didn't look too full, it still took about 10 minutes to get seated. That left us time to order some drinks at the bar, which were done well. They squeezed us into a two person table between two other full tables, so that took away a bit from the intimate ambiance, since we could now hear both personal conversations going on on both sides of our table. I was surprised they squeezed people into these small tables that were practically on top of each other when so many other tables throughout the restaurant remained empty. That aside, we had a great view of the city skyline. Our server was extremely efficient, friendly and polite. Oysters were a nice starter. Both of our steaks were cooked a nice pink medium rare, although we both preferred my filet mignon to his NY strip. Mushroom side dish was cooked nicely.

I felt very safe and comfortable walking around the area-and parking was free!  The restaurant itself was very nice. You walk in and your eyes are immediately drawn to the cityscape. We had no reservations, but were told it would only be a 15 min wait (Thursday around 7). We decided to go to the bar; after getting a drink we just decided to eat there. The atmosphere was so much more enjoyable and the service EXCELLENT!  Pomegranate martini was wonderful! I could've drank them all night! Not too sweet and very smooth going down. Appetizer was fried asparagus- again, amazing! Definitely a must try (only of you enjoy asparagus). I had the short ribs and it was to die for. My husband had the prime rib and shrimp scampi combo which was also delish. We decided to have desert and ordered the chocolate molten cake. It was the perfect ending to our dinner.

When the waiter came to my table there was no presentation of the menu, no greeting, he didn't even offer his name. Ordered a drink, appetizer and entree right away since I was sitting there for so long. When he brought my water he reach over me, which really bothers me and you would think they know best coming from a ""high end"" restaurant, and in his case he had plenty of space on the other side for him not to have to do that. When my pomegranate martini came out the glass was all wet as if they were too lazy to dry it or were playing bumper cars with it. Once again sat for a while before my appetizer finally came. I had to do the look around dance to get someones attention but no one ever came to have my plate removed. As a matter of fact I had been their for an hour before I actually had my entree in front of me!

I am sorry to say that the Weehawken location has gone down hill. First off, the hostess told me she did not need my Landry's card?! Foolishly I trusted that and have subsequently not received the points for my visit. Our waiter Dennis was VERY friendly, very positive and always smiling...I do not necessarily blame him for our dining experience. Food was either late, wrong or not up to specification. First off, it took 20 minutes for one shrimp cocktail to arrive and our first sighting of bread was with that very same appetizer. Bread should (and always has at this location) come out much sooner. We were seated in what I call the ""couples tables"" near the window, which was nice. At one point, both our table and the table next to us, had meals brought out with one incorrect entree. Of course the food runner took the meals back and brought them out together, correctly, eventually. We had one fish (grilled grouper) at our table which was good, and also a filet mignon that was a ""choice cut"" at best and undercooked. I realize this is not a steakhouse, but when you charge $39 or more for a steak, it should be a ""prime cut"" and be cooked to specification.  The drinks were great as was the desert and of course, you can never get tired of that view...especially when you get there right before sunset and get to see the lights come up in the city. It pains me to write a review like this, but the people running the place, just don't seem to care.

The Crap House booked a wedding reception and did NOT inform those who had reservations. They were overwhelmed by the wedding and took too many reservations and were unable to accommodate people arriving for dinner. (Note: we booked a month in advance and were never told about a wedding; spoke to Genevieve that afternoon to ask about dress code etc and were NEVER told about a wedding or running behind)Upon checking in we were told they were running 15 minutes min behind - which was a lie - people (with reservations!)  were waiting over 90 minutes for a regular table , longer for a window view. The hosting staff did not know how to handle the situation and managers were hiding until people started screaming and demanding them to do something; many regular patrons left vowing NEVER TO RETURN! After an hour wait and a confrontation with a manager because a relative tried to call the restaurant to pay for our meal as a surprise anniversary gift and some idiot named ""Brandon"" read the reservation book wrong and said we had left! Which ruined my sister in-law's present to us. We got a mediocre table in a busy walkway behind a servers station. The restaurant did comp the apps & dessert to try to make some restitution but the meal itself was awful!The evening gets worse! First, due to the chefs having to take care of the wedding there were NO SPECIALS on a Saturday night! They brought my wife the wrong fish (she ordered seared sea bass and was given Mahi Mahi ) The waiter & staff made no mention or acknowledgement of our 10 year anniversary EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE TOLD MULITIPLE TIMES ON THE PHONE AND WHEN WE ARRIVED IN PERSON. My wife is on a special diet (no gluten or dairy) and while we were assured the staff could accommodate her it seemed beyond their abilities. The food took forever, was luke warm and small portions. So other than the apps & dessert they got her order completely wrong! Not what we would expect from this level of restaurant or so we were told. My wife left the dinner disgusted and in tears!It wasn't that their incompetence ruined a Saturday night BUT THE ONLY 10th ANNIVERSARY WE WILL EVER HAVE!!! (Note - our 5 year anniversary was AMAZING AT 90 Acres - we should have went back!)The mismanagement and incompetence shows only greed by the ownership and a complete lack of respect for their patrons. The management team is severely incompetent and the staff POORLY TRAINED!!! A side note since when did ""neat casual"" at an upscale restaurant include: ripped jeans,""hoodies"" old sneakers, and wool ski caps indoors - can't believe that is acceptable here, many patrons looked liked criminals or homeless, and what is with all the visible tattoos on the brain dead hostesses, it does NOT make them look hip & trendy - it makes them appear cheap, trashy, and UNPROFESSIONAL -  how is that acceptable for fine dinning.WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK AND WILL NEVER  RECCOMEND TO ANYONE TO GO THERE OR ANY RESTAURANT THAT IS IN THE LANDRY'S CHAIN!!!THANKS AGAIN FOR RUINING THE ONLY 10th ANNIVERSARY WE WILL EVER HAVE!!!****  there was one saving grace, the GM Hans  reached out immediately to me once he read my yelp review and the  Landry's  rate your experience on their website .  He apologized for the evening, took the blame upon himself since he's the general manager, and set out with a variety of options to make  restitutions  for the evening.  It is rare for a general manager to be so personally engaged in a business and  working to reassure  that guess have an enjoyable experience .  It is only due to his efforts that my wife may consider returning in the future to the chart house.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I did read some reviews saying go earlier for a window seat obviously I listened went 30 minutes earlier when we walked in the hostess was about to seat us and I asked ""is this a table by the window?"" Shes like no its a 45 minute wait time!! Whattt!!??! I told them i double check and the girl on the phone said nothing and the HOSTESS Had the nastiest attitude! Talking to me as if I have no value.

Although the entrees weren't so good (thank god i ordered a side of grilled asparagus) i had some type of salmon I didn't like at all but i was already full from the calamari and bread! They did take off the salmon from the bill because I barely touched it.

It's right on the water so you can have a nice brunch and have a view of Manhattan. The food is amazing. You start off with  a nice array or breads, cheeses, italian meats,salads and olives. Then they have your typical breakfast items except they are of very high quality. Bacon,sausage,scrambled eggs, pancakes and potatoes. Then you have your crab cakes, salmon, chicken , pasta dishes and vegetables. Then you have a full omelet bar and carving stations with red meat and a pork.They also have a sushi station which was not very appetizing. It almost doesn't fit in. Full table with shrimp, some Asian items and lox. The last table is desserts. They have tons of little pastries, cakes and fresh fruit to pick from. Very nice selection. The brunch is $50 per person and comes with unlimited soft drinks and coffee. You also get one mimosas. The brunch will not let you down. I really enjoy the Chart House and will be going back for dinner soon. The staff is a little slow and not the friendliest but it is brunch.

I've run or driven past the Weehawken Chart House multiple times and I've walked past the Atlantic City Chart House. What brought us finally to the Chart House was the restaurant Michael Anthony's in Jersey City without-warning being closed. It was Hudson Restaurant Week so we decided to go try out Michael Anthony's, but low-and-behold they were closed for a private event even though their website and the Hudson Restaurant Week website said they'd be open. I guess it was a good thing because it got us to go try out The Chart House, instead.The Chart House is very easy to get to. They have a large, free, surface lot. Unless you want to spend $5 for valet parking. The restaurant is also next to a NY Waterway Ferry stop for NYCers, a NJTransit Bus stop and a Hudson-Bergen Light Rail station. The restaurant is situated on a pier that extends pretty far out into the Hudson River and offers some of the best views of Midtown Manhattan. Think Chelsea Piers but with a MUCH better view. The food was very good, yet pricey. It being Restaurant Week, however, we were able to order from the $35 three-course Prix-Fixe menu. Our obviously experienced waiter Nathan offered some very amazing service. He struck the perfect balance of attention to our table. We'll definitely be back.

And still, you have to wait around 30 min for ANY table, even with reservation.Food quality is getting worse and worse, I had about 5 calamary pieces in my appetizer and a ton of fried potatoes... it was pathetic. When i pointed to the waiter.. he just did not care stating it is what it is that is how is made now. I had this dish before... and last  couple of times was constantly bad, it was fried potatoes with couple of calamari,  saggy and sweet, with no dipping sauce.Fish smelled fishy, like an old one... and is not the first time, peanut crusted mahi actually had breadcrumbs and was boiled under... i had to leave it there... for 36 $. Hubby had flounder stuffed with crab, which was not lump crab , watery and smelling bad.Martini glasses are 3/4 full.. and glasses smaller, taste not the same.Only thing left is the view and spacious booths..I am wandering what happened with this place which used to have great food. Past two years is been a worse experience each time, getting little by little worse.Bill for 2 people was 280$... and most of food was left untouched.Let apart my husband is not at all a picky eater..Most probably will not return for dinner, rather for a drink on the deck.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I can say chart house wins in the crab cake arenaI split a wedge salad as the chunks of iceberg are so large.  It's so so good but certainly enough to share!For entrée  I ordered a special of crab stuffed flounder with asparagus and Yukon gold mashed potatoes.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

So much so, that after we finished eating, we just sat and chatted while enjoying the awesome view and didn't want to leave. And no one bothered us, rushing us out, and let us enjoy ourselves til we FINALLY got up to leave. My GF was in awe of the beauty of this restaurant and the views it offers. She even loved the thick, cloth-like hand towels in the ladies room! We both enjoyed the buffet food as well. I enjoyed everthing I put on my plate. There were breads and croissants, cheeses, roasted veggies and peppers, mini crab cakes, pot stickers and endame, pancakes, french toast, home fries, scrambled eggs, made to order omelet station, carving station with a wonderful prime rib and pork loin. There was more, but you get the gist. We loved the mimosas! Usually the champagne used in these drinks are too dry for my taste, but these were made with fresh squeezed OJ and were so good! I think we had 4 rounds! First one was included with the meal and refills were .99 each. Great deal! There were 2 cruise ships at the pier which had me wishing I were going to take a ride over the bridge to board one.The service from Cayenne was attentive but not intrusive. We didn't use the valet parking and enjoyed the walk from the parking space to the restaurant as it was an absolutely perfect day weather-wise.

We had a nice time at the bar while we waited, the bartender Ron made me a very nice Fleur de Lis, his version. It was very tasty. The ambience is classy, the view is great. You pay dearly for the view and the ambiance.They give you a little buzzer that goes off when your table is ready, it lights up with little red lights that go round and round, I was so happy when it went off, you'd think I won the lottery. Hey my family was hungry and we hadnt eaten all day so we could really enjoy dinner, had no idea 4:15 didn't really mean 4:15, but it was Easter, maybe they over-booked, seamed like it was unusually packed. Anyway, our table was nice, right by the window, view was great. Our waiter was Nathan, he was very entertaining, good sense of humor. We ordered coconut shrimp, crab cake, and calamari for appetizers. The crab cake was meh, disappointing, don't bother if you're a fan of crab cakes. The coconut shrinp was very tasty, little overdone but tasty and presentation lovely. The calamari were nice too, fried, a huge platter, surprised it was an appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Callahan prime rib, which came cold, had to send it back to be heated. Two NY strip steak which were okay and Macadamia nut-crusted Mahi. I liked the Mahi but it was way overcooked. Fish should be tender and moist not hard and dry. It would have been great if they hadn't overdone it. And we were all disappointed and annoyed that the we couldn't eat at the same time, because it took twenty minutes for the Callahan to be heated and come back out. How could they serve us a cold prime rib? $40.50 for that steak, you can't heat it through before serving?For dessert we ordered the lava cake, meh, what's all the fuss about, really? It's a really rich cocoa cake, with vanilla ice cream, and a little cocoa lava in the middle. And we also had the creme brulee which I thought was too eggy but okay.Overall, would not go back, we were there for three hours, way too long, got tired and bored between dishes.

(Chart House Condos anyone?)The food is very good, VERY well prepared, and will be very consistent on all of your returns, and believe me - you WILL be back. Make sure you go there ready for the ""Lava Cake"", because they will ask you about it early on during your visit.  Don't brush it off, spend the extra bucks and go for it, ESPECIALLY if you're on a date.  Drinks are also well prepared.  They have a sexy bar that you can hit up if you don't want to dine, but want something super classy, and super sexy to grab a drink at.  They have a full bar, some great bartenders, and the atmosphere at the bar (especially at night) is also super sexy. This place is timeless and unforgettable like our beloved NYC.  Just remember that you're not coming over here because it's the new ""it"" restaurant of the month, or the new ""cool"" lounge/party to be at, of the week.  You come here because you want to put on your classiest fabrics, your priciest jewels and watches, and you feel like experiencing elegance for the night.  Now don't get me wrong, you can come here for lunch, or brunch, and come dressed pretty casually, but for me at least, the essence of what makes Chart House ""glorious"", is coming here to dine on the clearest and starriest NYC nights.

His birthday was on a Wednesday and I called the evening of to make a reservation for 8:00 PM and it was no issue. I asked for a table by the windows to really take in the view and the reservationist recommended we come a bit earlier than the reservation because window seats are first come first serve but that she thought it wouldn't be an issue. We arrived and my boyfriend who I had just been directing via GPS was shocked! He was a little stumped when I told him to go into the Lincoln tunnel but as we drove up into the parking lot, he was taken back. We arrive and the hostess was very nice and when I told her our name for the reservation she told my boyfriend happy birthday! Very nice. So we were walked to our table and noticed the menus even said happy birthday! Very nice touch. The waiter was perfect, he was never on top of us but never too far away. I believe his name was Laurence. We ordered a Cesar salad and the calamari and friends appetizers. The calamari and friends had a few slices of sweet potato and some fried jalapeños which were a nice touch! And both were very decent size appetizers. For entrees my boyfriend had the NY Strip and loved it, and I had the stuffed shrimp which were amazing. We also ordered the creamed spinach which was more than enough...probably enough for four people! For our desert, we pre ordered the signature chocolate lava cake and it was amazing! It takes about 30 minutes to make so you need to order it when you place your dinner orders.Overall the experience was very lovely and the view really is breathtaking. It was very calming.

I went there for a birthday brunch with 12 girls. The service was impeccable. The brunch buffet looked wonderful. There was definitely some good points to it but at the same time it was a little overrated. I went there expecting to have wonderful seafood but that was not the case. I'm not a big fan of shrimp cocktail and that was one of the main points of it there were also mussels and sushi that I saw. The sushi did not look very appealing but I wanted to give it a try regardless. I did not like the sushi it just tasted unfresh. I don't even like muscles so I didn't try those. The mini crab cakes look very  appealing I had a couple of them but I realize after eating more than a few they started to taste very fishy. Their Shumai was great and so were the vegetable dumplings. I also tried the salmon I was not a fan. I did however like they're anti-paste with an assortment of Italian meats and  some cheese and olives. I also like their omelets which were made to order and their prime rib was superb. Some of the side dishes were lack luster such as the breakfast potatoes and their ""limp"" bacon"". The dessert looked great, I was stuffed by then so I only had the carrot cake which was delicious!  Also included with the brunch was one free mimosa and they were only $0.99 after that. Being that we were at a birthday party with 12 girls we all took a great advantage of the mimosas being $0.99 each, lol. In retrospect for $35 + tax +tip, a person If I were to go to a Sunday brunch again, I would much prefer the Mount Fuji to the Chart House. I do however enjoy going there for dinner and having some of their meals. I will be back for dinner but I'm not so sure about going back for brunch. Oh and I don't usually get stomach pains from eating anything but for the better part of the day after brunch I was curled up in a ball with bad stomach pains.

I asked for an Oban single malt and he confidently says ""we DEFINITELY don't have that, I'll get you a drinks menu"" and what do i see on the drinks menu? Oban 14 year........... okay... honest mistake i guess? time to order food. we got three appetizers to start off, only got two of them. why don't they just write things down? you're not impressing anyone by not writing things down and FORGETTING our order. but okay, time to order entree, steak looks good. ""let me get my steak medium rare"", I say, steak comes out almost well done... does this restaurant use a different standard for cooking their steaks? I could've stayed home and ruined my own steak.. We mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized and added ""that's really out of my control"" huhh strike three my friend. BUT there's more...

AND im sure all 8 of my dining companions would agree with me. the chopped salad was clearly minced, my 3 year old will be having that next time we come just so i dont have to cut anything up for her! oh and it was delicioso. colorful to say the least. NOW when it came to dinner, they didnt have prime rib at the temperature that we requested it for, So that set off a few maniacs that came with me (im the only non chalant guest here). everybody got over it and enjoyed their prime rib in the end and slowly but surely we all ate ourselves into multiple food comas. my left overs are getting cold here so im going to speed this up a bit. My shrimp linguini was fancy as fuck, fresh and fearless  the creamed spinach was m-a-g-n-i-f-i-c-o.

My boyfriend and I brought his mother and stepfather here to celebrate both of their birthdays. We called in advance and asked for the printed menus and a window seat if at all possible. The woman on the phone explained the window seat situation (that you have to ask upon arriving) and that was totally understandable. She then said they would print special menus. This was the morning of, before the dinner. We arrived and the hostesses were all horrendously rude. One of them rolled their eyes at us. We asked one of them about our reservation after we had been waiting over 20 minutes and she said in a super rude, angry tone, ""I DIDN'T check you in,"" like we shouldn't be asking her when it's her job? And when she did, indeed, check us in? Finally, one of them sat us down at a three person table and dragged over a chair (not a window seat, which is fine, but this was unacceptable) and gave us our menus, which were, of course, normal menus, not our printed that we requested. She didn't say absolutely anything to us - no ""welcome"", no smile, just plopped down our menus and left.So my boyfriend asks to see the manager. He comes over and is very, very nice and understanding and goes to get our printed menus. He brings them over and explains that the hostess couldn't find them. She never said ANYTHING about not being able to find these menus - no apology, nothing. She just shrugged and sat us down. Super unprofessional. The good parts all came after - the manager offered us two free appetizers and a free dessert. The food was all amazing - all of it, and the waiter was very nice.

I made the reservation 6 weeks ahead of time, selected 2 or 3 tables that i preferred (because you can't request one table) and told them what I had planned and what they neede to do.  The hostess put my instructions in the computer, I followed it up the day before my proposal with a quick visit to make sure everything was set. They assured me my plans to have a desert with ""Will you marry me?"" on the lava cake.  When we arrived my fiancee when to use the ladies room and I once again confirmed witht he hostess and proceeded to the bar to wait for our table. The table took some time because I had a narrow group of table I wanted, but I was fine with this. I checked on our table while she was at tehe bar and confirmed my plans a 4th time. ""All Set sir the instructions willbe given to your server"" I give the server the nod like are we all set and he replies... Wouldn't you know it, the lava cake comes out empty, no proposal as I sit with a ring in my hand ready to propose. A collosal screw up. I play it cool and go ask the waiter what happened the manager gets involved and the send over a half assed fruit plate with my proposal.  She didn't know, but it ruined the night for me.  I had a feeling because the server wasn't the usualy caliber the chart house employs. He just seemed off and my fault for not catching it, but this is a nice place and i expected more. So after screwing up the biggest momentt in our lives they STILL charged me for the lava cake and no appology or comp of any kind. I'm not lloking for a free lunch, but come on.   I didn't make a stink then, because I didn't want the night to be about their screw up.  I love the place, but man am I extremely disappointed in the execution and lack of detail I received on this November night.  I at least got a story out of it, but learn something about customer service and making things right.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Everyone knows that the view is spectacular.  I made reservations using OpenTable the day before with ease. We were seated immediately once we arrived. We didn't valet, it was a nice enough day to walk from the parking lot despite a couple of fisherman taking up good spots close to the entrance of The Chart House. The brunch is located in the bar area, not the most space but it is still managable to navigate.  They have an assortment of breads,cheese and fruits which I bypassed.  I started with the breakfast foods. The omelet station had a nice selection with spinach, shrimp, bacon etc to be added into your omelet. Egg whites are available. They have several other breakfast options like bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes and french toast. All were good but not very hot. Overall it was good but I'm not sure if I'd go back. Highlights include the mussels (again not very hot) crab cakes, shumai, prime rib and shrimp cocktail. I did expect more from the seafood. The Mimosa's were great! Service was attentive despite the many tables our server Will had in his section. I think the brunch is reasinably priced.

My guy requested a table with a water view and I was impressed with the skyline of NYC. It was amazing what we were able to see from our table. So I ordered the rib eye 10oz and my guy ordered the flounder. We had the fritters for an appetizer and it was delish. Only thing about my steak was that I wish there were a little more grill marks but besides that still good. We ordered the lava cake also which you need to get at the beginning of the order since it's a long process of baking. Any who management was great. Service was awesome.

It's a nice place for special occasions because of the view and the feeling that, after spending so much money, it had to be great.

They may have proved to be extremely good at parties, but they still haven't proven to have the necessary competence to provide a flawless dinner service.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It was a great choice and completely surpassed my expectations!The view of Manhattan is truly unbelievable. The restaurant sits on the Hudson so you are essentially surrounded by water, with boat and helicopter traffic buzzing by and a view of the skyline that cannot be captured with a camera. There is valet service available, and we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time so we sat at the bar for a drink. We were called almost exactly on our reservation time. We were sat down by the most welcoming hostess, and she personally wished my girlfriend a happy birthday and presented us with our custom menus that also wished her a happy birthday, a very nice touch.Our waitress Alexis was amazing and so personable. She recommended dishes and always had a smile on her face. We started with the Shrimp, Crab, Avocado & Mango Stack for an appetizer. It was delicious and the shrimp/crab tasted fresh. For our main dishes I tried the NY Strip 14oz. on a recommendation from another friend and it was cooked to perfection. I asked for medium and it was spot on. My girfriend ordered the New Wave Surf and Turf with the fork tender short ribs cabernet demi-glace and citrus salmon, also well prepared. By this time, the skyline was lit up and again, pictures couldn't do it justice. The moon was rising behind the Empire State Building and set it off perfect. We couldn't ask for a better view from anywhere else.Finally, for dessert, we ordered the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake everyone was raving about. They spelled Happy Birthday! with the chocolate sauce on the plate in a presentable style and the actual dessert was amazing, definitely worth it. Which reminds me, I feel like the prices on most of the food items here are reasonable. They may seem steep but I would definitely give the food an above average rating.

Nice wine selection, but you'll pay big by the glass ($10-$14). Servers are very nice and helpful. Water glasses always full and napkins folded when you leave for a bathroom break.

My boyfriend ordered the panko chicken which was also good. I ordered grilled ahi tuna being that the chart house considers itself a seafood restaurant. They served me a soggy piece of ""sushi grade"" tuna soaked in lemon sauce. Who serves grilled ahi tuna like that?

The prime rib is amazing...so is the coconut shrimp and the oysters Rockefeller. You easily forget that the Chart House is actually a chain - because it definitely does not feel like it. And while they all tend to be in touristy spots with nice views...this location is by far their largest and nicest that I have visited. (The restaurant that was there before they came in the mid 90s - Shanghai Red's - was much beloved too but I think the Chart House is a better fit for here- and I must not be the only one since they have made it for over 20 years now despite being hidden behind the Lincoln Harbor complex and easy to miss if you don't know the area!)  Everybody knows that the best views of Manhattan are from Weehawken. So if you are visiting and want to have a true skyline experience...ask for a table with a view! (Even though really...the view is good from any table!)",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Now we have somewhere very local that will make him happy when he's got the urge for steak. Sweet!I had cedar planked salmon and it was fresh and cooked perfectly.

They were ok.  The shrimps did not have any fresh flavor to it and the kimchee calamari--- why do they call it that?!....you can't really taste or see the kimchee-- kinda gimmicky if you ask me--- they got me cuz I ordered it! It wasn't bad just not what I expected.  Now onto the main course--- I ordered the barramundi Hemingway-- it was basically battered fish with some crabmeat or something on top with flavorless rice.  I was quite disappointed with my dish because it was so meh! ... I took a bite and could not finish it... What a waste! My friend ordered the scallops--- I tried s piece-- again-- flavorless and none of the seafood had that ""fresh"" taste.... I seriously feel like I could have done better at red lobsters!  for dessert, we had the molten lava cake--- which had to be pre-ordered because it takes half an hour to prepare... I was expecting a lot--- again--- it was not bad but definitely not amazing-- I thought at least the dessert would be good---Nope.  I have to say that the amazing views alone call for checking this place out but don't expect much from the food-- I was so not impressed with the food-- five stars for the view-- two stars for the food-- 3 stars overall.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It's really pretty breath-taking.We dined at Chart House Weehawken in a group of about 10, and everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals, including myself. So, why the 2 stars and lack of description? There were 2 issues I had, so let's dive in...First, the fish. Yes, it's very fresh and cooked near-perfectly here. However, when it comes to my seafood--and meat in general--I'm a big believer in eating sustainably. While I appreciate that at least a third of the Chart House's fish seemed to be ""locally"" caught, I was floored when using my Seafood Watch app to find that nearly all of the fish on their menu was flagged as ""Avoid"" due to the species being over-fished and/or not farmed using sustainable practices. With the Chart House being a pretty good-sized chain that can have an influence in sustainability, this was a huge disappointment to me.Secondly, and far more superficially, I couldn't believe that for a restaurant that sources their fish locally, they did not have a single bottle of white wine from the Finger Lakes on their wine list. Seriously?!?! Huge missed opportunity to support local wineries specializing in Rieslings and crisp whites at a seafood restaurant.Again, the food here was very good. If you're not into the whole sustainable seafood thing, then by all means go and enjoy--I'm sure you'll find the whole dining experience bordering on exceptional. For me, however, I just can't see myself returning due to the lack of care exhibiting in selecting their seafood, which I find to be a huge disappointment.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

We got seated a little after that & some folks that came in after us were seated before (which is why there are 4 stars instead of 5) but when we did get seated the view was awesome. The atmosphere was quaint and romantic. And for a nice touch we had personalized menus. On top it said happy Birthday to my wife. Of course we kept one. For apps I had the chopped spinach salad & she had the Lobster Bisque. Very Good. For Entrées she had the Baked Stuffed Shrimp. She enjoyed that very much. I had the Chicken Romano. Delicious.

The staff tries to create an upscale and romantic atmosphere. But it's much more casual that it appears at first. They'd make you wait for a long time - no matter what day of the week you pick to go. In my experience, having a reservation doesn't help much. The view is truly beautiful. But they will make you pay to enjoy it. Appetizers - $8-16.Fish & Seafood - $25-$40. Steaks - $28-$36.Sides - $4 to $8.The food preparation lacks imagination. And in my book plain food doesn't justify such high prices they charge. If you're willing to spend that much, you can always go to Manhattan and choose from a variety of fine dining establishments with amazing food and gorgeous views. The Hot Chocolate Lava Cake is incredible... as it should be for the $11 you'd pay for it. I'd only go there if I have out of town guests.

We scored deck seating with no wait, but unfortunately it was on a nippy August night. We weren't prepared for the windiness or the cool air. AND, it was all the way at the end of the deck, at the wobbliest table in the joint.My first letdown was the draught selection-- I can't remember exactly what they had on tap, but the pickings were slim (like 2-3 choices slim). I settled on Yuengling. Being all the way at the end of the deck, around the corner from where the waiters were gathered, there were long breaks between sightings of our server. I expected this to be a place where waiters would be falling all over you-- or at least have dedicated staff to help with the serving of the meals. The service was 'meh', but I've definitely experienced worse.My second letdown was the Spinach & Artichoke dip. It's usually a go-to for me, and the Chart House version had an interesting take on it that included crab, I believe. Sounded delicious on the menu, but it was so bland and tasteless that we didn't finish it.After a somewhat long wait for our main course, our food was placed in front of us and we were immediately asked if we wanted chocolate lava cake. It was sort of an awkwardly timed preposition, considering that we hadn't even touched our main course. I guess my face conveyed my confusion because the waiter then added that the dessert takes 30 minutes to make and that he had to ask at that point. Fine. I ordered short ribs, and they were absolutely delicious! They came with a side of mash which was just as tasty. I don't think I took a breath between bites. My mother had a salmon that was encrusted with something that blew all over the place with the wind gusts-- Messy but similarly delicious. The lava cake was good, though not 30-minute-prep-time good. Not at all different than any other (much cheaper) restaurant's selection. No mention was made of other dessert options, which I didn't realize until the waiter came out with a single cake for two of us. I thought that was odd, but it worked out fine. My overall opinion: I would go back on a special occasion or a date-- the view is unbeatable even from inside.

Manhattan's skyline literally illuminates their dining area. It's all so romantic and beautiful! I wish the review could stop here, but I gotta tell you about what went down with our food.My bf and I started with the over-rated and highly reviewed Crab, Avocado, and Mango Stack (~$15). It was a decent size sharing for us both to whet our appetites. Served with crackers, and we were brought the ubiquitous bread basket con butter.. Everything tasted fresh but I thought it could have done with some seasoning.For our entrees, BF opted for the Chicken Romano (~$19). It was basically a tenderized, HUGE, chicken ""filet"", fried with breadcrumbs and romano cheese..Pretty typical of a Cheesecake Factory-like dish but SO, SO delicious! And the mashed potatoes served with it were yum, too! Really creamy.I was served the Mixed Grill. I think it was around ~$30.. BUT I cannot find this dish listed on their website any longer! I guess it wasn't a hit and rightfully, so..It consists of Shrimp Scampi, a MASSIVE Crab Cake, Salmon, and I believe a choice of carbs and vegetables.. The second I was served my food, I noticed a loooooooong piece of hair.. ugh.I brought it to my server's attention and she immediately took it away and apologized to me. Minutes later, the manager came over and apologized for what had happened and offered us dessert on the house! I thought that was really gracious of him, considering how busy the place was (mid August, Friday night).Well, my *new* mixed grill appeared moments later.. and the waitress just left it in front of me without a word. After eating a few bites and noting that the temperature of the food was lukewarm, I wondered if this was the SAME plate that had been taken away and simply had the hair extracted.. Needless to say, I couldn't take another bite. I couldn't flag anyone down after that for another 20 minutes, so instead I dug into my bf's chicken :)The chocolate lava cake WAS delicious and went great with the ice cream.. I think next time I might come alone for that, or try the Shrimp Scampi.Overall, I was unimpressed with how our food turned out.. but I think I'd be willing to put that experience behind me and come enjoy the view with drinks and dessert :).((btw, if anyone's wondering how to dress for this place.. i did opt for summer dressy with a dress and nice wedges.. but did see many people lounging around in jeans and.. -ugh- flip flops.))",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It was a bit like eating bland soft meat/fat. I'd have liked it more if there was some .. pizazz going on, something special. My friend had the NY strip and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were amazing with those sweet potato strips on it. It was really nice. I never got to try his NY strip. The portions were pretty big though. It is steak after all. We didn't have any appetizers or dessert because it was so huge, my prime rib covered my whole dinner plate. However, their desserts looked pretty good, chocolate lava cake or something like that was what I would've had.Unfortunately, I didn't really care much about the view since I see it almost everyday, I was more focused on the food and that didn't deliver very well.

An exciting proposition indeed, which is why I decided to give Chart House a try on a Sunday evening. The place is massive and thumbs up to dining in big groups. The classy ambiance allows for romantic dinners as well. However, the food left me disappointed. Average at best, especially if you have crossed the river and tried Blue Water Grill or Aquagrill. I tried the soft shell crab from the special menu and it was definitely not worth paying $35+ for it. The lobster bisque was meh and I didn't end up trying the lava cake, that is so raved about in the reviews. Having said that, no denying that the view is fantastic and service pretty good. With limited dining options around the area, Chart House may be a hit.

It's definitely worth making the trip out for.  And the stars are mostly for that. But  after taking pics and catching up with friends, you slowly start to feel like the service is a bit slow & somewhat casual.And as the night progress you kinda start to feel a little more disappointed as the food comes. I mean honestly my group of four unanimously agree that the best part of dinner was the dessert-chocolate molten lava cake.So  I think chart House was just OK.  Will have to think twice before making such a long trip out again.  Unfortunately it didn't leave a very memorable impression for me or my friends.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

755,OLKLWtx2fYdtlT-sqzroJQ,Yuna D.,4.0 star rating,"Yes. It really was a night of ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" I came here for dinner with the guy I had a crush on for like the longest time ever, so I'm not sure if my experience here was amazing because of the ambiance, the food, or him. You guys can read and make the judgment for yourself. We started off with the calamari appetizer. ""lightly fried calamari & more, served with citrus chili sauce & marinara"" The ""more"" stands for vegetables; at least that's what I think I was munching on anyway. The citrus chili sauce was really good; the marinara seemed standard.We both got mango mojitos; the person who attended us was really great about making popular recommendations and he recommended this drink to us. It was super sweet, and didn't taste like alcohol, which I really personally like. It's really worth trying, especially if you like fruity drinks.The guy I went with had prime rib, and I had the herb crusted salmon. Portions are really, really, big. I think I only ate like half my salmon. It seemed a little weird, because by herb salmon I'm guessing they meant a lot of seasoned breadcrumbs on top. I mean, I like breadcrumbs, so heyyyyyyyyyy. The salmon is cooked perfectly; it's very moist. If you like salmon, which I do, you'll like it here. I didn't try the prime rib, so I can't really common on it, but it looked amazing.Thanks to the lovely recommendation, we also tried the lava cake. Okay, as I'm writing this I just knocked it back a star. Eh. The ice cream is really good, and crust of the cake is so sweet, delicious, and crunchy good. When you cut into it, the chocolate lava is supposed to spill out right? Well that didn't happen. Bummer. The inside was gooey, but I was hoping for more of that amazing chocolate drizzle that you could dip the cake into. We got one order and shared it between the two of us, and we still didn't finish it. While the guy excused himself, the person who attended us chatted me up to keep me company, which was really nice of him (It's kind of awkward just sitting there by yourself, twiddling on your phone). +1 for awesome service.The ambiance is breathtaking. I grew up in NYC so I don't think I've ever really appreciated living in such a grand city. The view of the skyline is amazing at night, and there's a path outside you can walk along right next to the water. Definitely happy with my experience.

756,W76zQHuDuigwQVgmErMTcg,Pauline F.,5.0 star rating,"My last trip to Chart House was for their Happy Hour. It's a good sized menu, perfect for getting several plates and sharing with friends - tapas style. It's also a great way to have some amazing food on a tighter budget. The bar/lounge area is very comfortable, and of course you still get the amazing city skyline views. The feel of this area is also a little more laid back from the dining room.Fried Artichokes - good, not too greasy, light breading. The sauce that comes with them, lemon basil aioli is amazing. I ended up using it with almost all of my food. Truffle Skinny Fries & Friends comes with thin fries, sweet potato chips, and plantain chips. The fries are great. The truffle really makes them something different. Both the sweet potato chips and the plantain chips tasted okay, but they weren't crispy - no crunch when I bit into them. It almost seemed like they were left over from the day before - not fresh. Mediterranean Chicken Pita tasted good, but it wasn't my favorite of all. Firecracker Shrimp - what I liked the most about this dish was that it actually tasted like shrimp. Sometimes fried shrimp losses the taste completely, either because the breading or the sauce overpowers it. This is not the case with the Firecracker Shrimp. Same light breading as the Fried Artichokes. There is definitely a kick to this. Fish Tacos - I loved everything that came in the taco, but just a little too spicy for me. Prime Rib Sliders - my FAVORITE. There is just the right amount of cheese, and the meat itself tastes delicious. The caramelized onions complement it well. I would make the trip to Chart House just for these.Drinks - I've tried several of their cocktails and no complaints there. One thing I have realized is that the drinks take a long time to get made, even when you are sitting in the lounge area. Dinner Menu - I have sampled some of the dishes from the Dinner menu in several occasions. I've never had anything that wasn't great.

My husbands company holiday party was held here tonight, the view was phenomenal but that was basically it. We had a set menu but I still feel like the food hours have been way above average. The hummus appetizer was dry and didn't have much flavor. For my dinner I got the flounder stuffed with crab meat. I'm not sure where to even start.... I remover flounder being a white flakey fish.... On the inside it was gray and had such a fishy smell therefore also had a fishy taste. There is no way that crabmeat didn't come out of a can, it was also very very fishy tasting. The mashed potatoes were dry and the asparagus were not properly trimmed before being cooked. I ate the good part of the asparagus and some of the potatoes, there was no way I was getting that fish down. I told the waiter that I didn't like it, he offered to get me something else but at that point I wasn't interested in anything else. The service was also mediocre, multiple times I had to track someone down to fill my water glass. Honestly I will never willingly go back here.

Nice big private booths facing the breathtaking view and smaller tables up against the window. The service is great. I usually go here for celebratory dinners. They made special birthday menus for our group and wrote in chocolate on our desserts!Start with the warm spinach salad with bacon dressing. Delicious! Pretty big portion so for a starter it would be great to split. I love to get the surf and turf with the short ribs and scallops. Well portioned and always delicious! Chicken romano is great as well but I wish it came with more veggies! $18 for breaded chicken is a bit much-but it's so good. I always thought the food could be a bit hotter but the flavor is always there and you will not leave hungry! Definitely get the lava cakes, if you could possibly fit any more into your stomach.

Their buffet is so-soThe entrance is gorgeous, valet parking, very high class.When it is light out, you can see all of the ships and the city, but at night is the best time to go, when those new york lights come on. You are literally sitting RIGHT on the water, go to the second floor balcony to take some AWESOME pictures!When I was here for 2 events, they plated food was delicious, salmon was spot on and the filet was perfectly moist and pink.If you are planning on coming for a buffet, here are a few downsides:The desserts they had all tasted sort of cheap. A few years ago the dessert seemed better quality, but now the 5 cakes they have out are the same cake with a slight variation. The cake is rather tasteless and the icing is so-so. They had some chocolate cake that ended up just being a glorified brownie. pretty meh for such a place, i just stuck to stealing all the fruit.The food itself is good, their ceasar dressing is DELICIOUS- I highly recommend it, best I have ever had. the prime rib is pink and delicious, but the turkey at the carving station is dry. The turkey on thanksgiving buffet is VERY dry, not like moms turkey :(Garlic mashed potatoes are top notch, and so is the fish they had to offer, tilapia.

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly and professional hostess staff that were aware of our reservation by name and that we would be celebrating. I eat out a lot due to my job, and I find a professional host to be the exception, not the rule now at days. Very well done, Chart House!We were seated by the window and the view is spectacular!! Right across the river is the Empire State Building, and the view is always ""alive"" due to boats moving on the Hudson River. Probably one of the very best restaurants in which to see the Manhattan skyline without small N.Y. tables and high prices. The restaurant is at the end of a pier, so it's river and city-views all around...even if you can't get a table up against the window. I would recommend to be here around sunset. The setting sun reflects off all the tall buildings in the city, makes the Hudson sparkle, and provides more contrast to the skyline view. Once the sun sets, it's like a whole new view outside. New York looks very different at night with it's millions of lights. Well worth seeing!!The atmosphere is classy without being stuck up. The menu is simple but has ample choices. They even have a kids menu and crayons. The wine list is excellent. Our server Tracey and her helper Dick did an excellent job with our table. She made quick and easy recommendations for both food and drinks, was attentive but not overbearing, and handled every detail like a well trained professional. Excellent!!The food was very good. Very nice presentation, portion size is good, lots of food runners to get it all out there. The calamari appetizer was very light and tasty, and I enjoyed the crab cake dinner very much. The lava cake for dessert is very good. The chef will customize it for your occasion by writing on the plate with chocolate.

This is how I ended back at Chart House for a 2nd time. He initially made the reservations a month in advance for the weekend before Valentine's Day. I however was sick as a dog so we couldn't make it. He was able to reschedule with no issues for the following weekend. They recommend business casual attire however I saw many people underdressed. I guess it's expected since we saw a few kids also - toddlers and teenagers. This brings up the noise level and dials down the romantic vibe of the place. We got lucky and were seated by the window. The NYC skyline looked beautiful that clear night. We started out with the Calamari & Friends appetizer ($14). The ""Friends"" were breaded and fried vegetables (Carrots, Peppers, etc). This came with Marinara and Citrus Chili sauce. The dish was big and we were starting to get full off that alone. Calamari was good. For our entrees, my bf had the Prime Rib - Chart House Cut 10 oz ($28). I forget what sides come with it but he asked for the Baked Potato ($6) and a side of Coconut Ginger Rice ($4). The Potato he got has got to be the largest I've seen in my life. It was probably the size of my face! I didn't taste his Rice but he said it was good. He finished his Prime Rib and said it was probably the best Prime Rib he's ever had. I had a piece of it and it was delicious. I ordered the Baked Stuffed Shrimp ($27). The Shrimp are stuffed with crab and the dish is served with Artichoke and Tomato Orzo. This was very good! The Shrimp and Crab were so fresh and seasoned very well. The combination of Artichoke and Tomato Orzo complimented the seafood great. We also had their signature Hot Chocolate Lava Cake ($11) which was glorious! They use Godiva liqueur for their molten center. They also serve it warm topped with chocolate sauce, Heath bar crunch, and Vanilla ice cream. There wasn't a bite left when we got done with that thing.We had a great night out celebrating our late Vday dinner at Chart House!",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The crabmeat stack appetizer was very good as well as the soup sampler. However the main course (Mahi fish) was very bland.

We ordered lobster bisque to start (which was one of the best I've ever had) and the soup came before the bread. Not a big deal, but when the people next to us are seated 10 minutes after us (and who have a different waiter) are served their bread first, then it raises questions. I guess that just says staff is inconsistent. Hope to get lucky and get a good one.The seafood is great, especially the crab stuffing. Awesome stuffed shrimp and herb crusted salmon. Like I said, lobster bisque is some of the best I've ever had.You cannot get a better view of the city from across the hudson. Everyone says it. Come for the view, enjoy the dinner, hope for a good waiter/waitress and definitely order the choco lava cake.If you have been to a Chart House in a different city, this is really no different.

Yes, it's been said before and I'll say it again.  The view is absolutely spectacular.  I want to go eat there again, more so for the view than anything else.We came here for a business dinner and I think I made the mistake of snacking on too many appetizers and too much bread that by the time our meal arrived, I barely had enough room to eat, much less enjoy the dinner.I have to say that this was probably one of the longest dinners I've ever experienced.  We ended up being there for 3 1/2 hours.  I think it was because our server wanted to give us enough time to socialize, but it was a bit over the top.  We didn't get back to our hotel until 11pm.I ended up ordering the surf and turf with short ribs and scallops... they were delicious!

I had booked a table weeks ago, and followed up yesterday confirming our reservation for a window table noting it was an anniversary. I was told on the phone we were guaranteed a window table but outside seating was first come first serve. Upon arrival the hostess declared there weren't any window tables and they are never guaranteed - opposite of what I was told on the phone. My husband and I then opted to wait for an outdoor table, which we did know in advance was not guaranteed. We didn't mind the wait on such a beautiful night, but once we were seated it was all downhill. We ordered a bottle of wine and an appetizer to start. The waiter then tried to sell us on a 'soup or salad' in addition to our appetizer. I agreed and we ordered a salad. To cut a long story short, our wine took about 20 minutes to get to the table, and the salad that we were pushed to order actually came out with our meal. When I saw our meals arriving i explained we just received our salad so they brought our meals back to the kitchen, only to have our meals return luke warm and hard (thanks to the salad that was pushed on us). There was also no bread or water to be had until we asked about 30 minutes into sitting. Unfortunately the chocolate molten cake that's advertised at taking 30 minutes to prepare is completely microwaved, and of course our anniversary was totally neglected by the restaurant topping off this disappointing evening. Why else would people come to this place if it isn't for a special occasion - yet they completely ignore it, and make the entire evening subpar at best. I realize it's a nationwide chain restaurant but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt due to the beautiful views, but when bread and water isn't a given and they are charging top prices it's worthy of a bad review. We could tell that the main courses probably would have been tasty if they weren't completely congealed by the time we ate it.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It was dry on top of grilled pineapple slices with small potatoes and an onion ring on top. Yes that is a strange combo, none of those ingredients made the steak any better. On the bright side, the cocktails were great, and our waitress was top notch.We were a party of 11, half the group ordered the lava cake, nobody finished it. A chef in the kitchen would make a nice addition, but like I started out, the food is not the reason to come here.  One last thing, skip the valet parking. We were the only people in our party to use the valet. it is $5 up front and a tip is expected when they bring you your car.

His attitude was more like ""So what do you want? If you don't want to eat, then don't eat. I'll take it away."" Very disappointing and upsetting. Service has to match the quality of the restaurant which here is supposed to be an ""up-scale"" restaurant. People expect certain standard of the service but from the hygiene of the food and kitchen, service from the manager is just poor. You need to provide better service of the food and educate your employees/managers to treat customers appropriately.

Both soups were delicious. We shared the shrimp crab avocado appetizer which was absent the shrimp. Definitely not a starter I would order again.   As we waited...and waited...and waited, we finally received our entree and sides after 45+ min. All dishes were colder than a dead man's hand. At this point I was concerned we would get dessert with the main course. Low and behold, 40 minutes later we received dessert which should have been microwaved lava cake (a tiny step above what Dominos Pizza delivers) which was not even warm to the touch.

817,ZhRBIEqmRNrh9TLMWzIS6A,Matty G.,5.0 star rating,"The third place to get a rare five star rating in my book, The Chart House earned every single star and then some. I took my mother and her boyfriend to this place after hearing that they were in the state and wanted to do dinner. I was looking for a place with a great view, good food and a helpful staff. The Chart House did just that and then went beyond my expectations in just about every category. I will start with the view which is anything but less than the best in NJ. The restaurant is located on the end of a pier which puts the place as the furthest point into the Hudson in the local area. Adding to that, they have their entire back wall made of glass to offer a sweeping view of Manhattan from anywhere in the restaurant. And if the weather is good you can sit outside and enjoy the same exact thing but in the fresh air. This was one of the things my guests enjoyed the most and kept bring up conversation topics throughout the night.The food there is amazing and will probably be some of the best you will ever have. The steaks melt in your mouth, the fish and other meats are cooked to perfection, and the lava cake will leave your chocolate craving satisfied for days. Make sure to order the lava cake while you are still having your main course because it does take a half an hour to prepare. But let me tell you it is well worth the wait. Just thinking about the food right now is making my mouth water. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful when placing your order or looking for a suggestion of what to order off the menu. I really wanted to get a table with a excellent view and the host was very helpful with showing me each of the tables available.  Our waiter Sean always made sure we were satisfied was prompt with taking our orders and serving our food. Overall I gave the Chart House the covenant five star rating because of the excellent view of Manhattan, the great service, the awesome food and the great ambiance of the place. I would suggest making reservations at least one day in advance if it is later in the week/weekend because this place does fill up. The most important part was that my guests loved it and could not wait to come back. I would have to agree with them and would suggest this place to anyone. It is expensive, but I think it was worth every penny because you are definitely getting what you pay for at the Chart House.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It took over fifteen minutes for our bottle of wine to arrive. The restaurant has a whack policy on asking for your ID AND then asking you straight up ""How old are you?"" The manager, Bill said that this was normal! I've been ID'd puh-lenty of times but never have I ever been asked to announce my age to a party of six. And don't hold your breath asking for something extra like more pita for your app because ours never arrived. Yeah, it's a nice view but the dining experience is so completely subpar ghetto NJ.

It is on the pricey side which is why we only come here on special occasions but in my opinion that's what makes going here so exciting. I've always requested a window seat upon arrival, it's worth the wait but the views are amazing from all over. The service is always good and they make you feel special, always asking if you are there for a special occasion or not. I've had the coconut shrimp app as well as the entree and it is just so good. I've had the lemon herb crusted salmon which was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend has had the steak which was amazing as well as the pasta dish with the steak which was very tasty and something different. ORDER THE LAVA CAKE.

We made reservations, were seated promptly and the menu even had a headline with wishing my mom Happy Birthday. It then went down hill from there. 1. The area we were sitting in was extremely warm. I was sweating while I was eating. Bad news. 2. The waiter was MIA most of the time. They brought out our apps without plates, my beer took a 1/2 hour to come out (and it was warm), removing the dirty plates took forever. Meal could have been 1-1 1/2 hours but it was nearly 2.5 because of the terrible service. 3. The food was so overpriced and bad, very bad. I ate 1/2 my steak, my gf finished her salmon but for the price you pay, she felt she could have made it better, the apps (breaded/fried asparagus -wasn't soft nor fresh- and calamari -extremely fishy taste and bland-). 4. Dessert which you need to order 30 minutes in advance because it is made on order tasted like it was just taken out of the microwave and they put hershey syrup on it...it was stale chocolate cake (moulton lava my butt) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (which seemed to be the best part of the meal which is so upsetting). 5. The view was nice. 6. Their prices our outrageous with what you get. Wine is marked up beyond belief, the food is nothing better than red lobster. The service is better at so many other places...to boot they included gratuity but it was only a party of 6...bullsh*t to say the least. No wonder he was no where to be found. 7. The only good news was the manager was friendly and more attentive than the waiter. 8. Expensive and surely not worth it. I recommend RuthChris down the road or even Houlihans up the st...It's places like this that make me so mad that they remain in business.

From the Papadums in Pakistan to the Pain in Paris, I've had it all but none of that comes nearly as close to the Prime Rib in Weehawken. Let me first begin by saying that I threw a mild hissy fit when the waiter (who was very knowledgeable) unfortunately informed me that  there was not a single cut of Medium Rare Prime Rib left on this side of the Hudson. I stayed calm, the succulent pieces of Kim-Chi Calamari helped me ease the pain. That dish as a starter is a homerun. I had to keep up with my dining companions as they kept shoveling the perfectly battered squid down their jugular. Other notable starters to try are the: Beef Carpaccio (I like it raw), Coconut Shrimp (which reminded me of my days as a castaway living on a small private island off the coast of Hawaii, and the Spring Rolls which were a excellent for sharing. Overall the food was decadent. After the apps, the 9 of us took a break to take in the breathtaking views. If for no other reason, people should dine here at this establishment because it offers such breathe taking views of the greatest concrete jungle in the world. It was extra difficult for me to catch my breathe because I was so full from the apps. Anyway onto the main course...I ordered the Prime Rib, I had to have it Medium Well, as that was all that was left. I ordered the Callahan Cut because it was recommended to me by a dear friend of mine. I'm glad I did, because this hunk of meat essentially salvaged my night. What a perfect combo of fat and juicy pieces of red meat. I struggled to finish the whole thing, but I wanted to be able to enjoy some of the sides we ordered: Orzo, Cream of Spinach will make you draw wood if you're a guy and the Risotto. All 3 sides were a perfect marriage for my prime rib. Last but certainly not least we had Chart House's famous Lava Cake. I don't  have much of a sweet tooth, but do yourself a favor and order this while you're here. Gentlemen, if you are looking to impress your date and set yourself up beautifully for the bedroom after dinner you'll want to order this. One bite in and you're swimming in chocolate heaven. I had to give this place 4 stars and not 5 because the kitchen was unable to prepare me a medium rare piece of prime rib and because even though they offer an extensive wine list, they did not have a Chateau Margaux which is a staple for Seafood and Steak restaurants such as this one. I will definitely give them my business again, and look forward to coming back in the warmer months so I can enjoy some cocktails on their patio area.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The service was impeccable, the seafood was cooked very well, and the chocolate lava cake that we ordered (which came with Happy Birthday drizzled in sauce on the plate without even asking ) was to die for. Although we see the skyline everyday, it was really nice to be able to sit back and really appreciate the view.  As expected, our bill was pretty pricey, but the service and quality of food that we received during our visit was worth it.

The wait staff is good and what you would expect at an upscale place.  Many diners come to this restaurant location to celebrate significant events, birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  Mine, was an anniversary dinner with my wife of 32 years on July 3rd.  We were treated to a spectacular sound and light show as an enormous line of thunderstorms rolled through the area and lit up the river and skyline. Pier D, on which the restaurant is located, is directly across the river from 34th St in midtown Manhattan so you're looking spot on at some great scenery and river traffic.The food is good, with a mostly American seafood theme.  You're not going to walk out saying that was the best meal you've ever had, but its ok, I would give it a rating of 4, and the view a rating of 6, so there's your 5 star.  The real deal is the location and the view.  Prices are in-line with the location.  You're significant other won't feel out of place if they want to get a little dressy.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

All four of us enjoyed our meals very much and the lava cake dessert was a great ending. I'm only giving three stars because there is no sense that anyone connected to the restaurant cares if you come back or have a good experience while there. Upon entering, none of the three hostesses behind the desk looked up from their computers. No one welcome us. when the one we were standing n front of finally spoke, she did so staring at her computer screen. The looked up briefly after saying ""How can I help you?"" and then went back to the screen. That's the last we saw of her face. She asked our name and stood in front of us for a moment and then moved away, saying nothing. A minute later another girl came over and asked if we were being helped and we had to say, ""We don't know..."" When we made our reservations we asked for a table but were shown to a booth. Not what we asked for, we said. Then we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Got to the table, and though the waiter kept stopping by to tell u he'd be back, it was 50 minutes before we got our drink and appetizer order taken. He was supposed to come back in a moment to get our entree order but he disappeared. Our appetizers showed up and we all still had all the menus on the table. This confused our food server as he didn't want to take our menus because we hadn't ordered entrees yet but he didn't have any place to put the food. We finally got the entrees ordered and also put in an order for the lava cake. That was good because our waiter disappeared for most of the rest of our meal. Thank goodness we didn't want more drinks. We did get to order coffee before our dessert arrived but waited for 15 minutes to get our refills. Three time during our meal, huge trays of dirty plates were dropped nearby, making people jump and leaving broken plates and food all over the rug. Everyone seems to be in a hurry but no one seems to be getting much done. Our waiter zoomed past us many times without a moment to stop but I don't recall seeing him do very much.

I have special ties to this place since I met a very incredible woman, who I now call my wife, at a bar nearby on her way to dinner at CH. But you didn't come here to read that story of course. So let's begin with the fact that you are obviously not paying for the food when you shell out the dough for the overpriced food and are going for the views (god help you if you can't pick a better place for a first date though...at least pit some effort in!!) Granted they have the signature crab stack and yummy oysters but they can't maintain a consistent quality, which simply bothers the crap out of me. At our last visit the crab stack was bland and the steak was horrid. I was served 50% fat and literally did not get to enjoy the rib eye. Also, I'm not sure if they ran out of nice dishes since the plating was without effort. Anyone can scoop some rice and throw a piece of meat on the plate...bit this was not a BBQ at my family's back yard and not for the price i am paying. Would I go back? Yes, but only since my wife likes the crab stack.

It was a great event. The service was really spot on- they allowed us to come 2 hours early to set up, helped us bring our supplies up, were attentive throughout the event and didn't rush us out. Food was really good - had passed apps including stuffed mushrooms which were good but burned my mouth as I greedily stuffed it in after chasing the server down. Shrimp cocktail good, nice big sweet shrimp. Mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and bacon wrapped scallops divine. Tiny spinach spanakopitas were delish. Sushi rolls fine. Chicken satay fine. Clam chowder first course yum- little salty but so many clams. Salad good. And then filet mignon medallions cooked perfectly med rare- juicy and delish! And mashed potatoes great. But of course the best was the lava cake with ice cream. Really haven't been to a catered event with such a good sit down dinner. Views are ridiculous. Parking valet and easy. The only reason not a 5 star review is if I had to pick one thing - the facilities and finishes were a bit worn. I think if they were to do a reno and get new chairs/tables/linens etc would knock it outta the park. Would def have another even there again.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

We used Open Table to book the reservation while driving down the road to Chart House, arrived 5 mins ahead of the time and waited for 10 minutes to be seated, no problem. Half way through the appetisers the manager introduces himself and tells us the appetisers and our dessert are free tonight because of the 'long wait' to be seated.... Having just waited 25 minutes at Son Cubano with no waiter and then leaving, I felt this was the most opposite and awesome experience we could have asked for!!! This is our 4th time at Chart House, our 'menu guide' for the night, Joey, was super knowledgable in all aspect of the menu and the extensive wine list, and explained the specials in such a way that you could already taste them in your imagination!!!! I couldn't call him a server or waiter, he was friendly, relaxed, super professional, described everything in the right level of detail, and efficient beyond the call of duty. We made sure his tip included the value of the comp'd items that were taken off our bill and made sure he was well rewarded, he entirely deserved it and was an amazing ambassador for the restaurant. We had the Kim Chi Calamari and Shrimp & Lobster Spring Rolls for appetiser and I thought I had died and gone to heaven!!! The dishes arrived quickly as did our drinks, and the tastes were out of this world. We went on to have the Salmon Nicoise and the Savory Shrimp Pasta for entree and while both we delicious, the homemade pasta and the garlic and wine sauce on the dish were a taste sensation. We finished with Key Lime Pie, which is so sour it is beautiful, it really cleans up the palette as it is supposed to, it is also sweet but not in a sickly way.

863,oUtPKe3d-PdJvU38DTIKVg,Charles B.,4.0 star rating,"First, I will say this. I'm not one to take pics of my food and post them so you won't see that here. What I will say is this was my first time here and it was a first class experience. My partner and I went there for lunch Sunday afternoon; running very late for a 3PM reservation. I called to say we were running late and we didn't get there until 3:30PM. The ladies at the reception station were so friendly and understanding.  We were seated (at a window. I might add) in less than 10 minutes and the restaurant was busy. Our waiter, Jose A, was such an amazing person; he really understood that what customers pay for most is service and he delivered in the most friendly, professional, courteous and engaging manner. Your food, scene, decor could be fantastic but if your service falls short, your establishment fails. Jose did not rush us; allowed us to order each appetizer one at a time and gave us time to digest it before asking if we wanted something else. He let us sit back, relax and enjoy the scene, our wine, our food and our afternoon. 5 STARS for Jose A; he rocks.Now the food!! We opted to do multiple appetizers instead of entrees so we had more to share/sample because we didn't want to be weighed down with a heavy lunch. We started with the shrimp and crab stack; Awesome!!! Next, we had the Kale and Butternut Squash salad; Awesome!! Finally, we had the East meets West Tuna; Very Good...I didn't care for the kimchee slaw; too soggy, no crunch.The view of NYC is great. You can't argue that in any way. The only thing I can say about this place is that they need to perhaps revamp the decor. It looks a little dated.

869,EreDviInDBQYaOvFfyYHlQ,V P.,2.0 star rating,"This USED to be my favorite restaurant in NJ. If you asked me 3 years ago I'd give it 5 stars. I was a regular. I have the Landry's card. The location on the pier is sheer genius. Hands down one of the most remarkable spots for a restaurant anywhere. The decor in this place is top notch, on the level of a 5 star hotel. Direct midtown views on the Hudson, windows all around! I live nearby on the water in the Port Imperial area and can't get enough of the view. This is THE place to impress a date or out of town guests. Make sure to come early and ask for a seat by the windows. I used to do my bdays here. They put your name on the menu :) Nice touch. They pay attention to details. Valet. The women at the front desk are great. The bar ordinarily mixes killer drinks. The service is usually over the top; friendly and fantastic. The food is presented well. Depending on what you order the food is great. I kinda got used to the menu and realized that while the food is good, it's not the most flavorful in the world. But the other aspects make up for it. They make you feel like a million dollars. It is a bit pricey but not as high as some of the spots in the city. Did I mention the view? Yea. It's that awesome. Why be in the city when you can LOOK at how beautiful it is on the water. If you get seasick on one of those boat cruises, this is the next best thing! Awesome venue for a wedding or banquet. Why did my rating go down? Purely because of their ""Happy hour"" offering. I used to frequently come in as the setting is so mature, peaceful, relaxing and you can have a quiet conversation overlooking the skyline. (I'm not always in the mood for the loud craziness after work) But NOT during happy hour. Day and night compared to a dinner experience. Yes I realize that the appetizers are MUCH cheaper than they regularly are. Maybe a waiter is going to make that much less on a tip. But watering down the whole experience is such a turn off. Especially when you know Chart House's potential. Sometimes they don't even bring out the menu unless you ASK. They give you the regular menu first. As if they are hiding it? Once you order they take the menu away. What kind of game is that? They know it's appetizers and drinks, people will go for rounds. The waiters are HARDLY enthusiastic, zombies, as if they don't even want to be there. They take forever to come by and take your order. Once it took 30mins! As if to let time slide by. They purposely disappear after they serve you so there is more space between your rounds. They don't let you order more than 1 drink at a time. So when it gets close to the cutoff you either have to chug it or too bad. And what's the use? The drinks are SO watered down, just tastes like juice. Only good thing is that the food is at least at the expected quality. No this is not like Chart House at all. Yes I have had numerous negative experiences at Happy Hour (4 times), this is not a ""one-off"". Yes I have complained 2-3 times about this. To their credit I have been contacted by their attentive and friendly managers and even spoken to their brass in person. It is clear that management TRIES and has good intentions. But I have stopped answering their calls on the last time this happened because it is clear while they want to change, it isn't happening. I'm done giving them chances, there are other spots next door in Hoboken for Happy Hour.So at Chart House, you gets what you pay for.

We were arrived about 10 mintues early we were seated by 9pm. This is my first Mothers Day so it was nice to go out and celebrate that. We were seated across from the window, not a bad view of NYC. When the rsvp was made my partner asked for the menu to say Happy First Mother's Day. But the young lady said the machine wasn't working, that was a bust. For a place that makes tons of cash daily. They couldn't get the machine fixed. Needles to say i didnt believe her. Because it was so busy they probably didn't want to print extra menus. Anyway, I ordered the baked stuffed shrimp with a loaded baked potatoe, NO bacon. I can't eat pork. Our food comes out and its bacon all over my potatoe. Mind you we are waiting for the food for at least 20 mintues or so. I tell the server they take it back. My food comes back out, 15 mintues later. Potatoe has no bacon....but i see bacon all over my plate, in the sauce on my shrimp. So now I'm thinking they just put another potatoe on the plate which is fine but didn't give me a new plate. I tell my waitress, Nancy, that again its bacon all over my food. This time i wait another 20 mintues. She then brings out a regular  baked potatoe, with all the condiments on the side, butter, sour cream etc. All on a new plate. I'm pregnant and after waiting almost an hour for my food. I'm even more  aggravated and hungry. We initially ordered dessert, our waitress didn't even offer to speak with her manager to give us the dessert or meal for free. She apologized, sure. But my food was sent back twice. I was full off water but still hungry. Needless, to say i am disappointed with my experience. The place is nice and romantic.

One she loves the NY skyline and two because the food sounded good.I called and made reservations. They asked what the occasion for us coming in was. This struck me as odd but I told her it was our anniversary. This proved to be a pivot point that took this restaurant from great to awesome. We arrived on time, and were seated at a window seat almost immediately (requested upon arrival). From the very beginning the staff made us feel like they were here for us. Every person I came into contact with, from front desk to walking past servers on my way to the bathroom, were awesome. I walked in and said I had a reservation. Front desk greeted me and wished us a happy anniversary. Upon being seated the hostess said the same. The menu's even specifically said happy anniversary (bonus points because my girlfriend noticed this not me). She ordered a mixed pineapple drink (which was delicious). We ordered Calamari as an appetizer. The menu was a little misleading as it said it was only rings but it came with both rings and tentacles. My girlfriend doesn't like tentacles, but fortunately I eat anything so this wasn't too big of an issue.I ordered the salmon and she ordered the Barramundi. We also ordered the Lava cake at this time since it takes 30 mins to make. The entrees came out in a reasonable amount of time. My Salmon was amazing. Fell right apart and tasted great. It had a little more crust/breading than I would normally like, but the flavor and texture were right, so not a big deal.I didn't care for her Barramundi (I thought it was really sweet), but I think I might have just been spoiled by my salmon since she liked it.My mashed potatoes side was good and her rice and veggies were good as well. Right after dinner the lava cake was delivered and it blew me away. It didn't blow me away because of its taste, it was good, but not necessarily the best I ever had, it was the presentation. Again, it came out saying Happy Anniversary. It was the finishing touch on an amazing evening.Food aside, the decor feels nice. The place screams luxury and comfort. The price was reasonable given the ambiance. It made the night very intimate and, dare I say, fancy.The view of New York is second to none in my opinion. From my seat I was directly in front of the Empire State building, and you could see lower Manhattan without issue.

When we first sat down my glass had gunk in the bottom of it. The server kindly said he would replace it but then forgot and only remembered when he filled everyone elses glasses. So I had to sit for a while without water when everyone else had some. Then when the appetizers came we realized there were only 3 small plates, rather than the required four. The waiter didnt bring us the other one until we were 3/4ths of the way done. We also had to flag him down to get drink refills, he did not check in very often. Service wasnt terrible, but certainly wasnt excellent. If I'm spending that much money at a nice place, I expect excellence. He also started to clear the table before two of us were finished eating, which is a pet peeve of mine.Overall: Very much worth it.

He came back and checked on us just enough, which is something that many waiters don't do correctly. It's either excessive or not enough.The coconut shrimp was an appetizer my husband and I shared- it was plenty. Remember it's an appetizer and you don't want to fill up on it! I think there were 4 big shrimps and we both had 2. Plus it wasn't fried to the point of greasiness, it was fried perfectly- no grease at all.The bread was excellent and I think the butter is a healthier option, it's not real butter and you can taste that. It's probably Smart Balance or something along those lines- really good since I prefer that instead of butter.We both had the spinach salad which was great. How can you go wrong with warm bacon dressing?!We both had the Romano chicken which was again.... Just an amazing dish, plus it wasn't heavy. I like feeling full but not that disgusting full feeling. The last meal was the lava cake- which my husband and I shared. Now this was amazing but something went wrong.....First of all, the lava cake has to be ordered at the beginning of the meal since it takes 30 mins to prepare. Now when my husband and I were sharing the cake I was literally on my last bite- I saw something hanging off my fork so untried to shake it off thinking it was just melted chocolate. I pulled it- and it was the longest hair I have ever seen!!!!! I was completely put off and I felt like that ruins the experience.Jose came by and I told him what happened, h profusely apologized. Moments later the mama get came by and again, profusely apologized. He offered us free drinks and another free dessert but I told him after that I didn't want anything- just to go home. He understood. Jose came back with the check and said that the cake and both spinach salads were taken off the bill. I was shocked since we ate the entire cake and there was nothing wrong with the salads. I was planning on coming back regardless of the hair mishap, but showing how much they care about their customers, the excellent service and of course the amazing  food will always have me coming back here.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

891,UtEmtJm0q-8tUQOMGnfi4g,Tom L.,4.0 star rating,"Came here for an anniversary dinner. We went to the bar first for some drinks, but since it was Memorial Day, there was no happy hour. After ordering our drinks, the bartender tells us the system automatically deducted to happy hour prices at that time. However, it was only for one drink and none of the food items came out to happy hour prices. Just thought the inconsistency was a bit weird. Then we went to dinner and throughout the night from hostess to waiter, service was very good. Since I mentioned it was our anniversary, they brought custom printed menus that we could bring home. We ordered drinks (try their mojitos...not too strong but pretty tasty and fresh), followed by the rest of our food. The calamari ""and friends"" appetizer was just calamari and fried bell peppers and what I think were japaleno slices. Okay, nothing great. The chopped salad was very mediocre and left unfinished as well. As for the entrees, I had the short ribs and also tried some of the mixed seafood grill. Again, both were just okay. You can definitely tell this is a chain restaurant, but you come here for the view and ambience. They also brought out a complimentary dessert that said happy anniversary which was nice as well. I'm not one to complain about free food, but it was essentially a small bowl of whipped cream with one strawberry and two small hard biscotti. We had a few bites and left it. This place is pricy too.Two drinks, an appetizer, salad, and two entrees came out to around 120 after.

He goes on and on about how this is place is soooo good. So I am talking with other colleagues who have been and they tell me don't go. Ok, these guys are all my friends and I figure why not give my colleague who originally suggested it a fighting chance. Fast forward, I'm on my way to Weehawken , this Lincoln tunnel toll better be worth it I am thinking.  We get there and it is crowded. I made a reservation so I am getting so excited about what is about to transpire. Its pretty brisk outside and guess what, its pretty brisk inside Chart house. I felt like I was literally eating on the pier with the bay windows open.  So we are seated near the windows where you can feel a constant reminder that its winter and the river is outside. You can feel a constant breeze of wind. People have jackets on while they are eating. I felt like I was camping. One thing is I'll admit is the wait staff is very nice and helpful, I will give them that. That's what the two stars are for, but unfortunately this is a eating establishment. So we get to the start of a unsatisfying dinner. I order the hummus appetizer to start. Let me tell you I can make hummus from scratch and there is no sugar involved. This was a hummus dessert, yummy eh not really! To normalize the situation I asked for lemon slices and grounded salt and pepper  to be brought to the table. I mean come on, hummus shouldn't be that hard to make. I should asked for the check after that experience. The bread was cold and rock hard. I had to ask for warm bread. Then came the meal in which the island Mahi-Mahi and Coconut crunchy shrimp was ordered. First the rice was Sahara desert dry for both dishes. The vegetables for both dishes were dehydrated NASA grade quality. Now I know what the astronauts will be eating on their trip to Mars. I tasted one of the coconut shrimps and it was tough, sigh.. My fish was ok. The sauce and flavoring for the fish was watered down. Both dishes were not finished. It was easier to remain hungry and disappointed. I am glad I didn't order dessert.To be honest this meal was not even up to par with Fridays and I am talking Time square Fridays my friend. During the meal I immediately shared my assessment with my colleague via mobile text and of course he was shocked and couldn't believe it. He resorted to bashing me for the Korean restaurants I have taken him too. Hey Kimchee is what it is. It never pretends to be something it isn't.

They looked great, too. We chose to have our wine with dinner, our dinner came and wine didn't. We had to find our waitress, who didn't bring our wine until we were more than halfway done with our dinner. Then, of course, we finished with the Lava Cake and that definitely didn't disappoint.

With the center party room, you actually have to walk out of the room to the hall to view the skyline of Manhattan but is still wonderful. The Chart House also has a nice little patio upstairs that is outside that is great for picture taking on a nice day. The restaurant and bar downstairs are also very nice. The service was excellent. We had mimosas and they kept them flowing. I really enjoyed the brunch. We had a buffet style lunch with an omelette station. The salad and eggs benedict were delicious.

The view, ambiance and physical restaurant is breath taking. The service was also wonderful. I am not a food/drink snob by any means but enjoy a good meal with a glass of wine. I was looking forward to both. The wine by the glass selection was embarrassing for a restaurant that size. Not varied at all and my white wine was WARM and bitter. The shrimp cocktail app came out like a science experiment with white ""smoke"". While some may find this fancy. I found it cheesy, unnecessary and was disturbed by the chemicals that were prob put in the dish to make is smoke and it continued to make a sizzling sound throughout the entire time I ate. The shrimp was ok, not the best I have eaten by far. I ordered sea bass and my friend ordered steak. Neither of us made it 1/2 way through our meal. Mine was very fishy and the risotto underneath it was ice cold. My friends steak was chewy and could probably ""moo"" after asking  to have it cooked well done.

Only one of our guests chose to do the restaurant prefix clam chowder, shrimp scampi and creme brulee. We also ordered a dozen oysters and the jumbo lump crab cake to start. Everything was fresh and tasty. For dinner someone ordered the spiced yellowfin ahi, another person got mahi mahi, I had ordered a seabass from the specials which sounded amazing with mango salsa and mash potatoes however when I got my dish it was something completely different. Some other fish with rice and vegetables. I didn't bother to reorder or complain because I was with guests and on a time crunch so I ate the meal that was given.  It was good but just not what I wanted so I was a bit disappointed. For dessert we ordered the lava cake to split which was delicious of course. We left full so that's always good. Chart House is pricey but then again most all seafood restaurants are. You don't really want to discount shop on your seafood but mostly here you're paying for the name and the view. It's definitely good eating for a chain seafood place.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It was very busy but seems like it's that way all the time. We went there for my birthday and had reservations. Unfortunately, (even with reservations) we had to wait 45 mins. Whether that is the ""norm"" or not, as consumers and patrons, I don't think we should have to accept that. As we got seated, we were presented with menus that had a special ""Happy Birthday Yauhann"" message at that top - very novel yet nice touch. The menu was robust with many great options. We did have the Hummus Trio, Chopped Salad and the Fried Asparagus. The Roasted Peppers Hummus was the best of the three but I am spoiled with a phenomenal Lebanese place close to home. The Fried Asparagus was fantastic as was the Chopped Salad - both are highly recommended. My entree was the Filet with Gorgonzola. I was hoping to see a Surf and Turf (steak and lobster) option but Shrimp was the option for Surf and Turf. The filet was very good, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It came with mashed potatoes which were good but had many chunks of uncooked potato. I don't know if that was the intent or not but would have preferred something else. Now the dessert....HOLY SH*T, that was amazing. We had their signature Chocolate Lava Cake....get it, get it, get it...that's all I can say about that. The service was very good and the biggest shock of the night was the price - no where nearly as expensive as we thought it would be.

For the entreé, I had the sweet & spicy grouper which was great (but the portion should've been a little bigger for $32). My boyfriend had the 16 oz. steak and he devoured as much as he could. And of course, we pre-ordered the molten lava cake and attacked it as soon as it was set on the table. Be forewarned although it is delicious, the chocolate is very, VERY rich.

It's still incredible to me that you can cross a river about a mile wide and all of a sudden you're in another universe, culturally-speaking. Gone are the frat boys and the upper-crusty faux sophisticates, the poseurs, the hipsters, the fashionistas, replaced by bad hairstyles, far too much cologne and makeup, and wanton overuse of curling irons. In a further irony, there is also what seems to be this fantasy by the patrons, that because they're within view of the big city, they're actually part of it, or just like it, or even actually in it, just more convenient to where they live. Why bother crossing a bridge or going through a tunnel? It's eight bucks!Our waiter was a lifer. Apparently he'd worked at several Chart House restaurants. He was super nice and relatively unobtrusive, if a bit rough around the waiting edges. Our appetizer, the ""Mango Stack"" (a disc-shaped ""stack"" consisting of crab meat, avocado and mango in layers) arrived with one side of the disc fallen, but he was apologetic and we didn't really care. It was tasty and fresh, but relatively bland.When asking for recommendations he always referred to what was best-selling, but seemed to have little knowledge of what everything tasted like, except maybe the mango stack. Apparently when the stacks break irreparably in the kitchen, the staff gets to take the spoils. He had little to no knowledge about the wines on the list, and when we asked for a recommendation for a Pinot Noir he again referred to what was best selling.  The food was good, but the restaurant definitely has a bit of a factory feel. My dining companion had a wasabi-crusted salmon, wrapped in prosciutto, with a miso glaze that she liked a lot. I opted for the 16-oz prime rib, which came a tad on the fatty side, but was probably more flavorful because of it. The horseradish cream and jus that came with were good complements, and the garlic mashed was fresh and tasty.We had the apple crisp with sundried cherries for desert, which was good, but I was so full when I left that I was really about to explode. Skip lunch if you're going here; the portions are large.The things I didn't really appreciate were, again, the factory feel, and the sales pitch at the end for a frequent visitor program that required a $25 entry fee (offset with a $25 coupon good at a bunch of sister restaurants I'd never go to). It sort of lowered the experience to something other than dining. It wasn't super hard-sell or anything, but there was a used car salesman kind of vibe to the whole thing. They should just cut that out altogether or make the program free like most other restaurants do. They should be happy to have your email address and dispense with the $25 barrier to the program, because I left that restaurant and they have no way to market to me at all now. If they'd asked me to sign up for their mailing list, it would have been a lot more likely that I'd have done it. Someone needs to take ""Marketing in the 21st Century 101"" over there. Having tons of email addresses is unquestionably worth more than that $25 coupon deal that I would imagine doesn't sell that much, and it's kind of nickel-and-dimey slap in the face after you just dropped $200 on dinner for two.The food was decent, the view fantastic, and the scenery was interesting in a culture-shock kind of way, so for all of the above it gets three stars. I wouldn't by any means call it fine dining, though, so if that's what you're expecting, you might want to look elsewhere. Also, I'd recommend they start monitoring their seafood for what's sustainable and what's not. Grouper is a big no-no on the sustainability list as are a few other of their choices.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I had the dynamite mahi for an entree-not really dyn-o-mite.  It was okay,  but not what I expected...I expected a piece of Mahi-either grilled or broiled- either crusted with crabmeat/crab stuffing, or a nice little heaping spoonful of crabmeat/crab stuffing,  over a bed of coconut ginger rice....What I got was what I think was grilled mahi, covered in a thick spicy thai coconut sauce, which totally drenched my crabmeat and mahi, and made everything taste like the sauce-there was no mahi flavor, no crab flavor, no coconut ginger rice flavor, just sauce.  My husband had a similar experience with his meal.  I have to say that if I got what I thought I was getting, I really wouldn't have minded the price-but over a hundred bucks for just what I thought was an okay meal, was a little high.  I would recommend maybe going for a few drinks and some appetizers, and hangin' at the bar with the awesome bar staff.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The hot lava chocolate cake which people supposedly rave about.. you know, the one where you have to give the waiter 30 minutes notice before wanting it so they can make it fresh?

980,G4fEVpBjKyzdywIpOvAnrQ,Dan E.,4.0 star rating,"My wife and I went to the Chart House for the first time this past Saturday night.  To be honest, I wasn't even aware that it is a chain but there are a total of 29 Chart House Restaurants across the US.  It's not too far off 495 and was relatively easy for us to get to.  I was very surprised that they offer free parking, but be warned, the lot fills up pretty quick.  They do also offer valet parking for $5 which is actually incredibly reasonable.  We arrived about an hour before our reservation as we wanted to have a couple of drinks at the bar prior to our meal and enjoy some of the view.  It's a circular bar that is not against the window but you can definitely snag some seats that have a great view of NYC and the skyline.  As an FYI, they have about 4 beers or so on tap.  That's not a phenomenal selection but they have a great wine selection.  This is definitely one of the better views you are going to get at an NJ restaurant (maybe even the best).  I'm going to break my views up into two parts: the ambiance and the food.Ambiance - it's an easy 5 stars.The ambiance is absolutely phenomenal because you have a wonderful view of NYC.  You definitely have to make reservations here especially on a Saturday night.  Window tables are done on a first come, first serve basis.  We did not get a window table but we were still close and had a phenomenal view of the skyline throughout our entire meal.  If you're looking for a great atmosphere for some sort of special occasion, I can definitely see how this place will fit the bill.  Food - 3 stars.I've always wanted to try this place because I've heard people rave about it over the years.  The food is not cheap - it's about $30-$40 per entree and our dinner for two was over $200 (we did have a bunch of drinks but the drinks are not obnoxiously overpriced, by any means).  We started out with an order of the ""Calamari and Friends"".  It's basically your standard fried calamari with some other fried items thrown in there like fried jalapenos, fried red peppers and I think there were some fried sweet potatoes, as well.  It came with a marinara dipping sauce and some sort of sweet and sour sauce.  The calamari was pretty good - I'd order again but I did think the fried jalapenos were easily the best part of the app.Before our meals, my wife and I also decided to split the chopped salad.  It's actually plenty big to split between 2 people especially if you have an app prior.  I actually didn't think the salad was anything phenomenal.  I kind of felt like it was missing something.  I did like the chopped pepperoncinis.  They were a nice touch and gave the salad a nice little kick.  For my meal, I had the Spiced Yellowfin Ahi - it's a Chart House specialty.  It came with some wasabi mashed potatoes and some different drizzled sauces.  It was pretty good - unfortunately, I had a slightly fatty piece of tuna but it was cooked to perfection and tasted great.  The wasabi mashed were also very good.  My wife had one of the specials.  It was a seared Mahi with lobster and crab.  It also came with a tomato risotto.  Her meal was much better than mine.  I did try one bite and it was absolutely excellent.  It came in a great light butter sauce and the lobster and crab were both succulent.  If this is on the menu the night you go, do yourself a favor and order it.  It was excellent.  We also ordered a side of the creamed spinach which we probably did not need.  It was just OK.  It was more on the dry side and came topped with bread crumbs which only made it drier.  I'd skip this the next time around although my wife really seemed to like it.We also split the Chart House's signature dessert - the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake.  You have to give them a 30 minute warning as it takes that long to prepare.  I'm not the biggest dessert guy but this was excellent.  It was a great piece of cake, the ""lava"" sauce which is a rich chocolate sauce and some great ice cream on top which was a great complement.  I'd highly recommend this dessert as it was a perfect ending to the meal.  Get it - you will not be disappointed.So, all in all, it was a very enjoyable meal.  The food is not perfect but it's very good and you're not going to get a better view of the NYC skyline anywhere.  It looks almost magical lit up at night.  It's not a cheap place, so be prepared for that and the service was pretty good throughout the meal.  It's not the type of place we'll be coming to every weekend but I'm sure we will be back.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

If you want to be paying for the view more so than the food, this is the place for you. There isn't anything particularly bad about the food but I think its over priced; it is a chain after all. It definitely feels like a chain, the way they present their food is kind of like a restaurant in a hotel. Trying to be much nicer than it is. It's a pretty big place, can be a little noisey. The wait staff is friendly and professional but it can feel a bit stuffy. I had the crab stuffed mushroom appetizer and they were good. I ordered the filet mignon for my meal alone with sauteed mushrooms. Mushrooms were okay, not great. Without a doubt came from a can and just had a little butter on them. The steak was good, tough to mess that up. Could have been bigger though. Didn't try the lava cake dessert, seems here it's pretty good. Overall, it's just an okay place. It seems kind of like the place to go if you're a tourist in the area and want to dine while viewing NYC while paying slightly less.

Saturday night, a 9:30 reservation. This was not the first time I ate here. It was a spontaneous reservation through Open Table on my iPhone. Rather excited to land a reservation we made it to the restaurant on a cold night at 9:25. Little did we know we were going to be seated at 9:55. This will always baffle me. What is the point of a reservation if you will not be seated at your reservation time? Thinking to myself, a Saturday night, I'm sure the dining area is packed with parties of 10 and 12. If this were the case I was totally ok with being seated at 9:55. Well, unfortunately this was not the case. The amount of empty tables did not correlate with the amount of people who had left the restaurant while we were waiting to be seated. Baffled, once again.In regards to our meal - the Samuel Adams on tap was flat and the house chianti was better than expected. Our entrees were prime rib and steak medallions. The prime rib was not excessively fatty and the medallions were spot on. Each entree included garlic mashed potatoes. Our waitress came to check on us approximately seven minutes after our food had arrived. Luckily there were no issues with our entrees. I found the time between service and check up was too long. Upon completion of our meals our waitress was nowhere to be found. We sat with our plates at our table for a good six minutes puzzled at where she disappeared to.  Upon returning, she made eye contact with us and proceeded to another table. After addressing the issue at the other table, she finally made her way to our table to clear our plates. I'm usually not picky with things like this but at the same time don't disappear on your patrons.The view was really nice but if you're not sitting up against the glass, it is not that enjoyable from afar.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

You can never go wrong with a restaurant with a New York city skyline view... Also, this place is great cause it has outdoor seating almost like a marina. It is fairly large with a circular bar and lots of tables everywhere. During daytime, you can see everything that is going on across the Hudson. Lot's of windows and high ceilings... Very airy. At night, you can see all the city lights and cars rushing up and down the West Side hwy. I always get some type of seafood dish or pasta... Halibut, Mahi Mahi, Salmon are some of my favs. Of course the raw platters are always my appetizer of choice. The steak is a big fat piece of perfectly cooked juiciness as well.

First the location is phenomenal. The resturant is situated at the end of a pier that juts out into the Hudson right about even with the Empire State Building. The views are stupendous. The dining room is tastefully decorated, and has a nice classy feel to it. Lights are a bit low at night however. Could use a to be turned up a click or two. The service was excellent as well. Fast, friendly, efficient. Can't ask for more then that. The food. Every bite of food that passed my lips was outstanding. Started with a nice warm bread basket, butter was served room temp aka soft enough to spread. For appetizers we had the Mussels and the Fried Calamari. Both were outstanding. The Mussels were prepared in a white wine garlic sauce and served with a couple of pieces of excellent crostini. The Calimari was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Very crispy, and not chewy at all. Dinner I had the Prime Rib(medium) and Shrimp. This was served with a side of mashed potatoes. Steak was a 10, Shrimp was a 10, potatoes were a 10. Steak was melt in your mouth tender, shrimp were large and flavorful, and the potatoes were amazing. Had the Signature Lava Cake for dessert. Superb.

Cheese, anyone?), or the dreaded Happy Waiter.  Think Applebee's, Bennigan's, TGI Friday's, Chili's...the list goes on.Fortunately, Chart House is more along the lines of chain luxury.  Think Ruth's Chris.  Yes, it's a chain.  But it's still a cohesive, professional experience for the diner.My party of four arrived early for our 8pm reservation, so we requested a window table (FYI - you can't request the view on Opentable), and the hostess handed us a flashing beeper-slash-coaster before we made our way to the spacious bar area.The restaurant itself is soothing and understated, with furniture and accessories in earth tones to showcase the enormous windows that line the entire east wall of the dining room.  The view, of course, is spectacular.  As my husband noticed, dark nights and twinkling lights make even grungy Hell's Kitchen look clean and inviting.A mere twenty minutes later, our table was ready.  Two of my dinner companions started with lobster bisque, and another with spinach salad.  I snuck a spoonful of the bisque; it tasted well-blended, creamy and tangy with lots of lobster meat -- yum!  I enjoyed my own Caesar salad with crisp Romaine, fresh parmesan and thick, salty dressing.For our main course, two of us tried the Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi, served with peanut mango sauce and coconut rice.  Tender, flaky fish fillet complemented the coconut rice and smooth citrus sauce; this is for people like me who like flavor without the spice.  If you like hot stuff, you'll love the other big winner at our table: the Spiced Yellowfin Ahi.  The cool, seared tuna has a creative wasabi kick, and the combination is unforgettable.We were too stuffed for dessert, but got a glimpse of sumptuous, triple-layer mud pie, and their signature hot chocolate lava cake makes me think this is one chain worth a second trip.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

At first we were going to Le Jardin on River Road but quickly decided against it after reading their reviews. But that's neither here nor there. Chart House is everything it is hyped up to be.  The location is absolutely perfect, it is the first stop after the Lincoln Tunnel from the Port Authority if you take the NJTransit (I take the 158) Bus.   No need to drive in. Just take the bus. They offer valet parking for those who decided to brave the expensive tolls and River Road traffic.  The only complaint about the evening was the screaming crying baby by the window and his/her(?) nonchalant or exhausted parents. Otherwise the service, the food, ambience, noise level, price, quality were all up in the stratosphere and I highly recommend it to any one who is looking for a great venue to celebrate a birthday, graduation, promotion, or wedding.  I've been wanting to check out Chart House ever since a friend of mine had his Prom there ten years ago.  Again, just the view and the location is fantastic, people. Their competitive advantage is the seafood, so don't be afraid to try their scallops, their herb crusted salmon, the macadamia crusted white fish, the shrimp scampi, and of course to end the evening the chocolate lava cake which you have to pre-order. The waitress was very courteous and attentive and we never lacked the attention and the service that one should expect at a high end restaurant like Chart House.  A bottle of champagne, a happy birthday song, and smiling faces around the table were the absolute cherry on top of this delightful dining experience. Again, I highly recommend it to those who have not dined here. Yes, they host big events for Big Wigs, but they're very accomodating to the Small Wigs as well :) Superb, Chart House!

Every employee we came in contact with was very polite and attentive. We had 5:30 reservations but arrived about 5 p.m so we enjoyed the happy hour cocktails and appetizers at the bar until we were seated for dinner. I had a drink called  Fleur di les  which was refreshing while my hubby had a cold brew. We were so in awe of the scenery we forgot to order our appetizers but i'm so happy we remembered because the Calamari and friends & the lettuce wraps were to die for!  I suggest anyone visiting this restaurant try those two items.  When it was time for us to be seated we were given a seat right next to the window which gave us a chance to take in the beautiful view of the city and the water. My only regret was not seeing the view when the city lights were shining. As for dinner it was great,we ordered the mussels in white wine sauce for another app and it was delicious. I noticed they didn't have rib eye steaks on the menu but Jim our waiter said their prime rib is very good and can be prepared in a way that was closer to the rib eye. He was right because it was very tender and melted in your mouth along with the garlic mash. My hubby ordered the lobster tail that was paired with asparagus and rice and he also enjoyed his meal. The portions were big enough for us to share with each other and I still was able to take some of my food home. Did I mention the add on shrimp scampi we ordered on the side...Delicious. We are normally not dessert people but since it was his birthday we ordered the chocolate lava cake and it was awesome. I can not wait to visit this restaurant again.

1030,Eauaiz2JNX8co5pHSDjlEg,Carol M.,2.0 star rating,"I have been to the Chart House so many, many times over the past 10 years. I used to think it was a great spot and that the service and food were consistently good. The place is pricey but because it was all around good it was worth it to me. Last time I went (this week), the place must be under new management or something because I was really disapointed. Specially because I know that they could do much better, I expected better but there was not one thing that was actually good. We order the shimp cocktail as usual and although the prices have gone up accross the menu, what you get is less. The cocktail sauce used to have baby shimps in it, that is no longer the case.The entre was greasy, my boyfriends dish was supposed to come with the garlic mash and the vegetables side and it didn't. the plate look empty and boring, they don't even case how the food is presented.the drinks...were the worst, we had two bloody marys to start and he didn't ask us what type of vodka. when the bill came it said Grey Goose, but I would never have such premium vodka on a bloody mary because it's a waste, with all the heat and intense flavors you can't taste the vodaka anyways. We also had a martini (which tasted like water, mixed with olive juice and a tiny bit of vodka) and a mojito which tasted like lemonade. The drinks were so disapointing because I know that was one of their assets.Lastly, the famous Godiva chocolate lava cake that used to be 8.99 is now 10.99 and the quality is way down. the cake was not warm and therefor the center was not melted. We paid (before tip) 149.92 for an absutely underwhelming experience. We also, had no napkings or utensils until after the dinner came (yes...the server didn't bring it not even when we had appetizers). He also didn't bring any bread. He was not what you would usually expect when you go to the Chart House.If I had never gone there before, or didn't know any better I could have thought it wasn't that bad (as some of you think), but I know better and I know that this latest experience was mediocre.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

1034,TNUhttclXXuSBWvJxB3_Sg,Liz E.,3.0 star rating,"I went here with my boyfriend and his friends for a dinner to ring in the New Year, 2010.  Driving up, I could tell immediately that this was a wedding and general occasion hot spot. The valet parking is one indication.Stepping inside, my assumptions were further confirmed by the cascading staircases, luxurious carpeting, and stunning view of the Hudson and midtown Manhattan. The six of us checked our coats and were escorted to our table, which essentially had the perfect view of the city across the water. I had the sneaking suspicion, however, that it was this factor alone that we were spending a bulk of the check on. Our server approached, and instantly she was a turnoff. She had an insatiable desire to promote everything on the menu, to a fault. And she wouldn't take no for an answer until at least the second time. Every second was taken to promote another drink, or three, despite our ""no, thank yous."" The reservation was for 6 PM, and we instantly discovered we were not going to make it until midnight, our original plan.  Why was this?  The food came out at a million miles an hour - so fast in fact, that some of it came before the drinks!Speaking of drinks, be warned that the entire table complained of receiving weak ones. I had a sickly sweet mango mojito which tasted barely of rum, and had almost no effect on my motor functions. A tequila sunrise an hour or two later at the bar proved to be no more potent. On to the food. Chart House is primarily a seafood restaurant.  It makes sense - it's literally on the water, though I doubt any of the fish come out of the Hudson. For appetizers, lobster spring rolls proved to be a huge disappointment. Large and heavy, they were dry, and derived all of their taste from an accompanying sauce. The calamari was much better: crisp, crunchy, and with a peppery kick that weak mouths might not be able to handle. The jumbo crab cake was tasty and surprisingly moist as well. Seared tuna tartare was fine, but nothing special. When one looks at the prices, even in a time of celebration, this dinner, or any other here, is hardly worth the expense. Almost immediately after our starters, the entrees arrived. One girl and I had the macadamia-encrusted mahi mahi, covered in peanut sauce, mango coulis, and served with a coconut ginger rice.  This, unfortunately, was the biggest disappointment of the night, and I would forgo it at all costs, despite its popularity as the ""mac daddy"" of the menu.  The mahi mahi was fine enough - moist, tender, but there were no distinguishing flavors. Macadamias and peanut sauce just blended together, I couldn't even detect the mango, and the coconut ginger rice tasted nothing of coconut or ginger. In fact, we both joked that it tasted like Uncle Ben's. What's worse, the whole dish was just dumped on the plate. No attention was paid to detail and presentation, which made it even less appetizing. This was the case for all of the entrees really: a big salad, two steaks, and a seafood linguine dish. I might as well have been eating at home. And don't you want at least something green, or orange, or red, to accompany your meat and potatoes??? You'd think this would be a natural accompaniment, but it takes an extra $10 on average to get a side of asparagus or creamed spinach. The lack of the complete meal is irritating. If this were a steakhouse, it'd be customary and understandable, but this is a seafood restaurant, and something more than a scoop of rice or a potato would be appreciated. To Chart House's credit, its steaks are quite nice - so choose these dishes over the seafood and you'll be much happier. To finish off the meal, dessert couldn't be avoided. I'm known for always getting a dessert, but I had no desire to order any of them. I usually grow skeptical when molten chocolate lava cake and New York Cheesecake appear on the menu but, nevertheless, I did take a few bites. Two chocolate cakes were ordered, and admittedly, after having a taste they weren't too bad. But neither are homemade brownies, and for a fraction of the cost I'd rather be at home spooning undercooked batter into my mouth with a spatula. A raspberry creme brulee derived its namesake flavor from a few raspberries scattered on top of it, but a champagne sorbet with fruits (you won't see it in 2010 - it was a special only for that night) seemed to be quite popular. And that was our meal. 9 PM and we'd already been digesting for what seemed like a millennium as we desperately tried to draw out the night. A stint at the bar only emptied our pockets and let down our desire to get a bit tipsy. Leaving was the only solution. I can't see myself ever returning to the Chart House, but I can't tell you readers to absolutely rule it out. If you're invited, give it a shot. Just make sure to get the crab cake, a steak, and the chocolate cake and you'll be fine, as long as you have a table with a view.

Unfortunately, neither expectation was met at the Chart House in Weehawken, NJ. We had a reservation on 08/31 at 7 P.M. We requested a table for four at the window. We waited more than 15 minutes and were at last shown to a table with a fabulous view of the NYC skyline. The first problem was that it was uncomfortably cold. We requested and received a table change. At the new table, we waited almost ten minutes before our water glasses were filled, at our request, and bread was brought to the table. Our order was taken and served in a reasonably short period of time. However, some of the main courses were not very hot and we requested them to be reheated. When empty, the breadbaskets were removed and not refilled. We were celebrating a birthday. At the end of the meal, the prearranged single desert with a birthday candle was served. We were never asked if anyone wanted any other desert. Nor were we asked if anyone wanted any coffee, etc. Because of this less than expected service and food quality, I simply cannot recommend The Chart House at this location.

We got a great seat against the window and the view of the skyline is amazing.  Someone brought us our menus and in a really nice touch the menus themselves had a congratulatory message about our anniversary.  Our server was Swee.  No joke she may have been the most knowledgeable, professional and personable server I have ever had.  My wife is a vegetarian and what I loved about Swee was she knew how every item on the menu was prepared.  I have been to many places before and they think just because a soup doesn't have pieces of chicken that it's vegetarian even when it's cooked in a chicken broth. So my wife was relieved to know her meal would be a truly vegetarian meal. I won't get into the specifics of what everyone had but I had the kale and butternut squash salad and short ribs with mashed potatoes.  Both were phenomenal.  Something about the flavor combination of the salad was out of this world.  The short ribs were so tender I found myself holding the knife but not actually using it.  Finally for dessert each couple had the molten lava cake.  Any dessert that needs to be ordered with your entrée has got to be good.  While I enjoy a nice glass of red wine, I'm not a sommelier either and have no problem drinking a house wine.  Chart House has a pretty nice variety of wines ranging in price from affordable to ""who would pay that."" The also have a nice list of martinis.  On a previous visit my wife and I had the spicy cucumber martini and we still talk about it.  If I wasn't in charge of driving the in laws I would have sucked down one or two of those.  Overall this was a great experience and while it is a little far from where I live to be a regular spot I will always keep this place on my list when a special occasion comes up.",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

We also ordered a wine, telling the waitress we like a sweeter wine, and she suggested one (I apologize I can't remember the name) - she said it was one of two sweet wines they had, the rest was dry. Well, we got the wine it was drier than dry which I was quite confused at. We ordered our meals, I got a steak & ordered it medium-rare to medium and it was completely raw inside. Had to send that back. My husband ordered a dish that he had to choose scallops or salmon - he ordered salmon, and got scallops (all of 2 of them). So, so far the wine & the meals got all messed up. I wasn't trying to let it ruin our night. We did bring all items for attention up to the waitress & she apologized profusely.

We had dinner reservations at 8:45 p.m., so we got there earlier at 8:30 p.m. We still had to wait though so we went to the bar and ordered some cocktails (i had the ""fleur lis"" and he got gin & tonic) while we waited for our table to be ready. They had a spacious circular bar area with some flat screen tv's to entertain guests. We didn't get seated until about 9:15 but we were pretty pleased since they had our table near the windows with a great view of the NYC skyline. First they served us warm bread and crackers.. to be honest, the reason I'm mentioning this part is because I'm a sucker for good bread haha..especially when an establishment serves it warm. Now for appetizers, we had the seared peppered ahi tuna & calamari. Now I usually don't eat raw food (i.e. sushi, sashimi, etc..because no offense to any sushi lovers out there, eating something raw is just not my thing), so I surprised myself when I actually tried the seared peppered ahi tuna and I thought it was delicious! The calamari was great too. They were crispy on the outside and soft & tender inside (it wasn't chewy and rubbery compared to what other places may offer), and the sauce had a bit of a spice, it was perfect (sidenote: the sauce seemed to be thai inspired to me). I had a glass of white zinfandel to go along with my dinner and my boyfriend had stella. For our main course, we tried their seafood since it's their specialty, they were definitely great and fresh. So I had the macadamia crusted mahi mahi. It was pretty good but I guess I expected too much. It was still delicious nonetheless. My boyfriend got the dynamite halibut..now that was amazing. It was so soft, light and it melted in your mouth. Then to end our meal, we had their famous desert, the hot chocolate lava cake..it's made up of chocolate cake with a warm molten center, topped with vanilla ice cream and chunks of heath bar crunch & warm chocolate sauce. It was great! We had an amazing dinner there. This restaurant is definitely perfect for a date. Good food and just the right portions. But the best part of it is the atmosphere and the view. With the huge glass window facing the river, any table would've had a great view of the New York City skyline but like I said we were lucky enough to be seated right by the window =). We also noticed that they had outdoor seating, which would probably be more suitable during the spring or summer months. Unfortunately for us, it was raining and it was a bit foggy when we came. It was still really nice though. Our food came in a timely manner but do expect to be there for at least 2-3 hours. Our waiter hardly came back to check on us but I can understand because it was a busy night and he gave us space. I also respected that because I don't like getting harassed too much or being rushed through my dinner. Also, expect to pay at least $30+ per person.

Because I am not a huge steak fan I never had the urge to go to dinner there, but decided to make reservations for my boyfriend's birthday. We wound up going on a beautiful, clear night and the view of NYC was spectacular as we drove up. We opted to park the car and walk rather than valet & I liked the fact that we had the option. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, who seated us at a table next to the window with the amazing view. Our waiter  was very professional and friendly, and gave us great food recommendations.  While everything was delicious, the crab tower was by far my favorite dish of the evening. The pomegranate martini was also by far the best I've ever had. For drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert I found the price to be very reasonable. I've also been told that their brunch and happy hour shouldn't be missed. Can't wait to come back when the weather warms up!!",Chart House,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Steakhouses,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
