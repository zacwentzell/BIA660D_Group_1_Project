I had the chicken with mushrooms which was juicy, quite substantial, and very tasty. It was not overpowered by the mushrooms at all and went perfect with the potatoes and green beans both of which were very tasty.

If you have a restaurant in NYC with an outdoor seating area, odds are dogs are going to walk past it. Humans can't control when and where dogs go to the bathroom - all they can do is walk them in public, dog-friendly spaces (e.g. NYC sidewalk) and pick up after them.

Wine pour was terrible.  A crappy white was poured and we were charged $12.  I ordered a cocktail and it was mediocre and tiny.  $13.  $13 is fine if you make a good drink but he didn't even measure out the portions!We only ordered apps as we wanted to leave ASAP.  We had the escargot and salmon tartare.  The salmon was fishy and tough to chew.  The escargot were good in a creamy tomato sauce.  Bread was terrible.  Surprised they would serve that quality.  All in all this 2 star is generous.,La Ripaille,4.0 star rating,$$$,French

Met a group of friends here for dinner because the guest of honor wanted French food. It's a small intimate place where no more than five of us fit at the bar. It was actually kind of nice. The ambiance is old, almost like someone's living room in a dark apartment and very intimate. The owner and the staff were ridiculously friendly and attentive, at least until we got to our table, primarily because we were the only ones there (it got busier as the night went on). As the owner told us about the specials, he got visibly perturbed that we were going to get a few different plates of appetizers since we weren't loving anything from the entree menu. The apps were great; escargot, ravioli, cheese, mushrooms, crepes. And the servers were so accommodating, giving us each small plates to enjoy. We ordered an entree, lemon chicken, to split with the table, it was awful. Tasted old and rubbery. I was never more thankful not to have ordered an entree. What really pissed me off about this place was the way the owner/manager spoke to his employees in front of the patrons. I watched him yell at three servers right next to our table and back at the bar. I was embarrassed for him and for them and it made me never want to go back. If you're annoyed with your staff, take them in the kitchen or a back room; don't chastise them in front of your customers.

The staff does everything quite well, but don't expect fast service. A meal here can easily last 2-3 three hours, so if you go you better bring people you want to talk to. The meal is normally four courses and Laurent personally guides you through his five daily specials, although I normally go for the streak frites or pounded chicken breast. The wine list is almost exclusively French and German and you shouldn't even bother buying by the glass. You'll be here for a while so go ahead and get the whole bottle. Your bill won't be cheap, but the food and wine are worth the price.The vibe of La Ripaille works very well for dates, intimate parties or a relaxing escape from the rush of the city.

Some friends and I had an unexpected change of plans due to weather and, being in the city, decided to find a place to grab a meal. La Ripaille had a reservation for 6 on short notice and seemed well reviewed, so we grabbed it.The restaurant itself is nice enough. It's not a large place, but it's cozy and well decorated with plenty of faux ""old"" french posters and various other little odds and ends. The lighting is dim but not uncomfortably so and would be a decent spot for a group of friends or a date.After we were seated, it took 15 minutes for someone to come to our table. I had to ask the bartender if we could get menus and if we even had a waiter. My inquiry to the bartender was after about 8 or 9 minutes of sitting at our table and it STILL took the guy another 5-7 minutes to show up. When he did show up he was pretty cold and generally douchy. It was as though we should have been honored to be waited on by this guy. Though, by this point, we were all famished and parched, so just seeing someone willing to take an order was a good thing I guess.The food here is OK but I wouldn't even say it's better than average. If you want great and affordable French fare, La Sirene blows this place out of the water. I had some of the escargot appetizer which was decent and the duck entree which was a let down. The duck breast is trimmed of all fat which I found odd (part of the draw of duck is that succulent layer of fat that sits on top of the breast) and while it was cooked to my liking it lacked much of the flavor that I normally find in well prepared duck. Honestly, the green beans served with the duck were the best part of the entree by a good margin.Overall, I think there are a lot better places to spend money for food that is at least as good (likely better) and service that is far, far superior. Having waited many tables in my life, I'm generally pretty forgiving in the service category but I just couldn't get over the absolute lack of decent service here. That the food was nothing to write home about only serves to insure that La Ripaille will be relegated to my ""do not visit again"" list.",La Ripaille,4.0 star rating,$$$,French

Village brunch places (100 Acres, Extra Virgin, etc) but without the hustle and bustle (and without those 45-minute waits for Sunday brunch). I highly recommend their 'french toast'. It's really more of an interpretation, using slices of their french bread, dusting them with cinnamon and topping the plate with berries (syrup on the side). I rarely eat french toast and this quickly became one of my favorites. The eggs benedict are also great - fresh, tasty and come with your choice of salad or fries (go for the fries, they are always hot, crunchy and salty - the best cure for a hangover!!) Added plus:  They also have cheap mimosas and great french-pressed coffee. The only mystery to me is why this place isn't more crowded on brunch time on weekends.  Solid location, indoor and outdoor dining, reasonably priced food that tastes great - I'd expect this little French place to be packed, but its rarely crowded and we always have great service.

Lemon tart and chocolate mousse for desserts, still did not disappoint! Even though I had red wine, if you are a port lover, you would love their 10 year port.

Reminds me of a Parisian bistro.  The service is atypically French since it was super polite and accommodating but then again, we are in America.  Or maybe, this place just is atypical than most French joints.  The duck pate was fantastic; so was the pasta and the chocolate dessert.  There are more ""French"" items but I know without having tried them, that they won't disappoint!The authentic music also helps to create the right ambiance if you are looking to impress that special someone.

If you need any suggestions for food or wine, he'll gladly help you. You can tell he enjoys his job. And when my group was leaving, the owner asked whose birthday it was and gave me a hug!One thing to keep in mind with this restaurant is that the portions are French-sized, not super-sized like in America. I ordered the duck mousse for an appetizer, lamb for an entree, and dark chocolate with Grand Marnier for dessert. The lamb was good, though it was a bit salty, and the dark chocolate dessert was basically a large ball of chocolate heaven. I couldn't eat all of it, though, because it was a large portion for a single person, so split this with your special someone if you love chocolate! My sister ordered the warm brie for an appetizer, which was amazing. All in all, great wine and great food with great company made for a wonderful birthday dinner :)  Besides, you know it's good when the people a table over are speaking french!

Tragically, the chef is a gross incompetent who prepares horrible food. Last night I ordered duck magret, which is supposed to be made from the breast of an actual dead duck. What was on my plate was a pre-sliced, pre-pounded flat, seriously overcooked something that had no flavor of any kind. Accompanying this nightmare were string beans and carrots. Excuse me? The whole experience is a shame, because if the chef were fired and an actual French chef brought on, this place would be wonderful. Oh, I must mention that the bill came to about $64 for two. My friend and I gave the waiter two credit cards. We were both charged over $80. Yes, he charged both of us over $80. The owner fixed it by voiding the charges and correcting a new charge, but he was far too nice to the waiter who screwed it up and frankly should have bought us a dessert drink or something similar.

It is classically french bistro, from the kir to the pommes frites to the magret; really, some of the best bistro food in the city.Alain (the host/owner) is quite a fun character as well, and if the place isn't busy, eating here is a treat. If they are busy, it can be a little hit-or-miss, particularly if you are seated next to the busy walkway where the runners and waiters must travel. And because Alain is the one who really takes care of you, when he is busy, you can end up waiting longer than you might like. On the other hand, it's a little bit of Paris; leaving the New-York-minute attitude at the door is a good thing.For the prices, the portions are a bit small. Well, the portions are actually exactly the correct size: unlike too many NYC restaurants, you can eat three courses here without being stuffed or bloated.

119,sO86Fot_cIJ5NS_zkM2Lfw,J P.,2.0 star rating,"We were disappointed by our dining experience at La Ripaille. When I am served frozen butter with stale, cheap bread I am immediately on high alert. This is a time honored way to show your customer that you don't care, because it's not difficult to serve fresh bread and thawed butter.  The menu itself leaves much to be desired. While there is plenty of pasta and quite a few salads, there is very little in terms of real french cuisine. But my bad, I should have checked online first.So we had the mussels as appetizers, which were ok, except one of them was bad and none of them were cleaned. It is easy to detect a mussel which does not open after cooking and the tomato based broth was way too salty. The entrees were the shell steak with fries and pepper sauce and the duck maigret. All again very salty, but at least expertly prepared. The duck breast however was extremely small and had few accompanying items. Maybe the portions are supposed to make the dish more french, but I expect a little more for $25 and was still hungry afterwards. Waiters were nice enough but a bit pushy and the meal came out at over $80, for 2 main courses, one appetizer and 2 beers - after a $25 coupon discount. What peeved me again in the end was the fact that we had a 20% tip already included in the bill, without being told so.I am not sure what the other reviewers found here, I just saw a pseudo-french restaurant with few customers and complacent staff.",La Ripaille,4.0 star rating,$$$,French
