I would leave Jersey City, my home, and venture out to Williamsburg for this Japanese/German spot called Blank that was part bar, part coffee shop. Barcade is also a good spot to work and drink a stout or two, but not if you need to read paperwork as it's dark. I don't use paper, so that didn't bother me.Brewshot is like Blank, but without the German/Japanese vibe (I adore) or the 45 minute commute.I've never eaten here, just partaken in their amazing Happy Hours. They offer to turn the lights on in my area when I come with my MacBook (I always go with my MacBook. I've only ever been here for business).I like this place for my particular intentions and hope they keep it up.

I'm sure it won't bode well for business, however I like the idea of a place where I can watch football and it not packed to the brim for a giants game. After a lackluster selection of beers, terrible wings,( I may be in the minority here but when you say the chef's special for wings is a blend of seasoning and don't explain its curry and turmeric, wtf) and poor seating arrangement for TV viewing I still wasn't turned off enough to not come back.

Management had switched mid contract which made me nervous at first but it turned out to be better than fine. Brewshot and their staff over delivered! They not only got security and a dj on their own dime due to management switch, they made us 300 jello shots and desserts on top of the alcohol and food already included. It doesn't stop there.. they even donated a percentage of our bill back to us to add to our donation to Father John's Animal House. We ended up raising $1,210 with Brewshot's help! This is definitely our go-to venue from here on out. Thank you ALL.",Brewshot,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Cocktail, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

11,QX5Gwust46FtsIuT_nAm9Q,Karri S.,1.0 star rating,And yet another disappointingly awful experience at Brewshot. Went down there just now to order breakfast to go. We asked for the breakfast sandwich menu. The uninterested server pointed to the coffee/bagel menu hanging and said just order from that. There was literally no sandwich list on that menu. No one offered to help. One server was doing her homework at the bar and the other was more interested in having her own omelet. Needless to say we ended up without any food. We were so excited for this place to open in our building and it continues to be a constant and epic disappointment.,Brewshot,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Cocktail, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

19,SN3feZN6H4BkeOqf6wWiJA,Judy S.,3.0 star rating,"I live in Cast Iron Lofts..the building that Brewshot is located in. I have been here 3 times already. Honestly, it's ok..not bad, but certainly not great. My first time was when they were giving out complimentary baked goods and coffee for their soft opening. 2 girls in their early 20s were manning the counter and they were incredibly friendly and kind. I came back for brunch about 3 weeks ago with 2 friends. It was a unusual experience. There were numerous errors with our orders, which is not a big deal. It happens. But the manager sat down at our table, twice, to explain to us some computer error that caused all the issues. He did this for 5 minutes both times. It was awkward. It felt like a bit much.I just went to Brewshot just now to get the bagel lox sandwich to go. I unwrapped it in my apt. and it had barely any cream cheese on it. I do think a lot of places in Manhattan overdo it with the inch of cream cheese of a bagel, but this was just way off....too much lox and not enough cream cheese. I was annoyed and considered going back downstairs to get more cream cheese but the guy that took my order wasn't friendly at all and I didn't feel like interacting with him again.This place is ok. The only reason I go is for convenience. I'm not sure if I'll go back. Also, something to note Yelpers....nearly all of the reviews for Brewshot are from people who have only written one review...a 5-star review for Brewshot. That seems weird. They also all mention the manager Eli. That seems super weird, because I'm not aware of anyone named Eli, nor have I been introduced to anyone named Eli in my 3 visits. Which is fine. But the reviews all sound strangely similar.Brewshot, if you're reading...how about a coupon for some percentage off an item for Cast Iron residents?
