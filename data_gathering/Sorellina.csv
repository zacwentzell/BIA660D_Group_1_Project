The service, food, and ambience were all fantastic. I was nervous about how crowded it might be but they stuck to the reservations and sat us right away. I was unfamiliar with the wines and asked for the one most similar to Sauvignon Blanc. I can't remember the exact name, but the waiter's suggestion was on point (as I ended up having three glasses)! We received bread with a chickpea spread compliments of the chef, which was yummy. We started with the pretzels (yummy!!). I had the squid ink pasta which I loved and my fiancée won the clean plate award with the bucatini plate. Also, somewhat random, but I absolutely loved the music selection! It was the perfect mix of 90's with current. It made for the perfect Valentines Day.I also came for happy hour with my best friend which is a great deal. We had the lamb fingers and the flatbread, which we both loved. Definitely a great date night spot or a good place to grab a few glasses of wine and a little pre-dinner treat at their Aperitivo.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Their decor is bomb AF. I love the teal pillows, long bar, the contrasting in different elements in the restaurant and of course - their dishes. Although they're more on the European side in terms of serving - I absolutely love every plate I order here. Note-able dishes would be the:Cavatelli & Ragu with Pacchieri Pasta.They also make Struffoli fresh in house with a healthy drizzle of honey!*Drooling* They always have specials brewing & they have a grand selection of Italian wines & Negronis. On the pricier side, this isn't an everyday spot, but a great place for date night or just to try something with a different atmosphere in town.

We enjoyed the 3 bottles we had.The food was also delicious. I liked the meatballs particularly because of the blend of meat they had. The flavor really popped and the sauce also complimented it well.The meat and cheese selections are also delicious even though I hadnt heard of many of them. Just ask the server and they will help you find what you want!The carrot appetizer was also unique and had a great flavor. The different carrots made the dish particularly awesome. Finally the broccoli pretzels were the highlight of the meal. We have never had anything like this. It was a great appetizers and I would recommend. The cheese, broccoli, with the pretzel.. accompanied with the mustard all worked suprisingly!!Great job sorellina!",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

7,FEfCBx0MuKB0hSSB62wE1g,Singergirl 1.,2.0 star rating,"I've been here five times, and I really want to like it...but I think it's gone down hill.  The pros: very cute space, excellent happy hour drink specials before 7pm, a nice change from the glut of sports bars in Hoboken, some pleasant dishes.  Cons: the service is usually bad.  One time our waiter was so clueless and laidback that we actually thought he might be stoned.  Two other times, the dour, inattentive bartender spent more time chatting with her colleagues than tending to the customers.  Food has been hit or miss.  The happy hour lamb fingers came out hard and cold, the ""broccoli pretzel bites"" had no broccoli to be found. Their fried green tomatoes were delicious, and I did have an excellent meatball sandwich there from their happy hour menu, but it appears to be gone.  In short, the managers have a good concept-- Hoboken needs more attention to seasonal cuisine and good wine-- but the execution is sorely lacking.

10,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,2.0 star rating,"Since my boyfriend is new to Hoboken, we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. We passed by Sorellina, which looked like a cute date spot. Since we had some time to kill, we decided to grab a drink.I had the Forza Negroni (Bulleit Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Campari) and he had the Classico Negroni (Dorothy Parker Gin, Carpano Antica Vermouth, Campari). Both tasted pretty similar and had a little too much Campari for my taste. You're probably better off sticking to a glass of vino from their wine list, which is pretty extensive and reasonably priced.Some of the appetizers stood out to us so we also ordered a bite to eat. We had the Grilled Cherrystone Clam Spiedini {with housemade chorizo, caracara orange marmalade & sourdough croutons} and Nonna's Meatballs (pomodoro braised veal & ricotta). Neither of these appetizers were good. They certainly looked appetizing but that was about it. The clams were ridiculously chewy. I even tried cutting them up into super tiny pieces but even then, it was extremely difficult to eat. The meatballs had an okay flavor but the texture was just not the way meatballs should be. I don't know what it was - maybe they ground up their meat too much but the consistency was that of a hot dog. My boyfriend compared it to a Vienna sausage.I was really hoping to like this place but if the appetizers we ordered weren't very good, I'm not sure if I would want to be back to try the mains.

They gave us enough time to look over the menu, which took a while. We never felt rushed. They were at tentative and friendly.The squid ink pasta dish was great. The flavor was excellent. It had this spicy kick to it after each bite, which I really enjoyed.They have a huge wine list. We had to google the bottles to figure out which one to get. We got the tami I believe. It was good.The restaurant is big enough so that you get enough space between the tables so you don't feel like you're on top of each other. Bathrooms are small though.All that being said, the branzino dish wasn't edible. It was the saltiest dish I've ever had in my life. I've never complained about salt before, but this was intense. I was going to just eat the potatoes, but they weren't cooked enough. They were too hard.I had someone else try my dish to make sure I wasn't tripping. They agreed with me though.I felt terrible. I didn't send it back. I just kinda scraped it around to look eaten. I'm hoping the chef just screwed up with my dish.

However, on the upper side of Hoboken, you are paying for the atmosphere as well.  I ordered the CACIO E PEPE CONCHIGLIE (milk braised pork with black pepper pasta).  The pasta was perfectly cooked and al dente and the flavors were all there. However, I found it to be way too oily and heavy after my third bite.  I ordered a negroni cocktail to help cut through the fattiness of the pasta.  Halfway through my pasta, I notice that my entire plate had about a quarter inch of olive oil that had oozed out of the pasta.  By the end of the meal, it took about 10 minutes to wave down the waiter for the check.

But please offer more than just one slice of heaven!       For entrees we had the pork and pepper pasta, Kale raviolis,   And the farfalle with mushrooms.     I enjoyed the pepper pasta, the sauce was smooth and different which was much appreciated.    Kale ravioli was inhaled but my wife was a little disappointed with the farfalle .      Over all scale 1-10 I would give it a 5.    Service needs to be tightened up.    The ambiance was a plus and food was good but the service took the overall rating down.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

I went there with my best friend for the first time last night (I live in the area and familiar with most of the wine bars). We went on a Friday night so decided to sit at the bar to avoid the wait for a table.The bartenders were great -- and we decided to share a couple of apps to begin. We decided on the meatballs, black truffle burrata, and octopus salad. To put it short and to the point -- extremely disappointing.The meatballs were bland and somewhat cold. They were hard in the middle and lacked ANY ""oomph"". The octopus salad maybe had a total of 1 small tentacle cut up and was served over cabbage. CABBAGE. We literally got a bowl of cabbage with a couple pieces of octopus sprinkled on top. The burrata -- WAS SERVED HOT OVER BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Lacked ANY FLAVOR and was melted on top like mozzarella instead of its usual form. After that, we decided to not order any more food because we were turned off at that point. We pride ourselves on being ""foodies"" and appreciating great dishes. However, we left extremely unsatisfied and still hungry. We told one of the bartenders who offered us a free round to make up for the food -- he was great.

I went there with my best friend for the first time last night (I live in the area and familiar with most of the wine bars). We went on a Friday night so decided to sit at the bar to avoid the wait for a table.The bartenders were great -- and we decided to share a couple of apps to begin. We decided on the meatballs, black truffle burrata, and octopus salad. To put it short and to the point -- extremely disappointing.The meatballs were bland and somewhat cold. They were hard in the middle and lacked ANY ""oomph"". The octopus salad maybe had a total of 1 small tentacle cut up and was served over cabbage. CABBAGE. We literally got a bowl of cabbage with a couple pieces of octopus sprinkled on top. The burrata -- WAS SERVED HOT OVER BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Lacked ANY FLAVOR and was melted on top like mozzarella instead of its usual form. After that, we decided to not order any more food because we were turned off at that point. We pride ourselves on being ""foodies"" and appreciating great dishes. However, we left extremely unsatisfied and still hungry.

We got right in and sat before our reservation. The drinks were expensive and overly priced. I wish there were more choices for wine. There was ONE Chianti Classico and I had to look up if it was DOCG. Now on to the food. It took nearly FOREVER to order, let alone get our appetizers and food. This made me feel like I was back in Italy. The chef brought out something delicious. Thank you for that. Our appetizer was pretty good. Loved the baratta. I think it would have been better served with a touch of prosciutto but not entirely disappointed. I ordered my FAVORITE dish cacio e pepe, which is exactly what it says it is: cheese and pepper. I was expecting something straight out of Italy, since this is an ""authentic restaurant."" The cacio e pepe was made with conchigli (shells)... which NEVER happens in Italy. It's always made with either a spaghetti or something similar. The chef also made this with pork. Cacio e pepe is never made with pork. EVER! Not to mention, because of health reasons, I can't have pork, so when I asked the waiter (who was extremely kind and helpful) if they could make the cacio e pepe with out the pork, the chef refused. If you're going to call yourself an authentic Italian chef, you should know the basics and do not insult our food by adding something that didn't belong.  Regardless, it's the chef's decision. I just thought it was an overkill. This was not my first experience here. I came once before and asked for take out because I didn't have time to sit down and eat a meal. The chef refused to prepare something for me to take out because it would change the quality of the food. This isn't Carbone, although it tries to be. Make the food and send me on my way. I don't think I'll be dining there again. It was a mediocre experience that is nothing like Italy.

The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat sauce was seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, we got homemade ice cream sandwiches. The snickerdoodle cookies were great and the ice cream was delicious.

They were both OK but it wasn't something we couldn't enjoy elsewhere for cheaper. The second time we were there, there were barely any customers inside, so we got a nice seat by the window. I find it weird that when you walk inside, the hostess table is all the way in the back? Anyhow, we were seated and we already knew what we wanted so we put in our orders. The pumpkin bread pudding is very yummy and that came out first. We ordered the duck egg and tuna sandwich.

We arrived, put in our names, and were told to wait in the bar area until a table was available, which was totally fine with us. We ordered a bottle of wine and partook in good conversation. The wait ended up being a very very long wait, over an hour and a half. We were checked on periodically, but there did seem to be a bit of disorganization amongst the waitstaff. The ""chef's compliment"" hummus sticks were a nice touch, though. We ordered some cheese and charcuterie while we waited, and while the meat plate was lovely, the cheese plate was really lacking for the price. The pieces of cheese were so small, and the cheese itself really wasn't good enough to justify ordering it again. After we were finally seated we ordered food. I found it interesting how drastically the portion sizes varied on the dishes- the steak was huge, and the veal was very very small comparatively. We ordered a number of dishes (I had the grilled branzino) and they were all pretty good, but nothing was so delicious it really stuck out to me. The roasted carrots appetizer was probably my favorite part of the meal.

The place was empty, my bf and I were the only two ppl there. We sat at the bar first then decided to sit at a table by the window, after all we had the entire place to ourselves. Also, the bartender seemed quite distant, polite but not particularly friendly which was kinda odd given that the place was empty and he had all the time to make nice. However, our server was a little more accommodating and he was quite knowledgeable about their wine selection. I wanted to start riding the rosé train a bit early but he was not quite committed to driving, however he did give me some directions as to how to get to my desired destination. Mind you, there were only three rosés on the list so I was bound to find my way. We ended up trying all three but really only liked one... I guess it's safe to say I won't be on that train again until, perhaps the summer.Overall, a large selection of wines, most of which received above average ratings, based on my wine app ( yup, I'm one of those).

The other 2 were completely unmemorable and if fact, the salami has a really unpleasant flavor.  For entrees, I had the mushroom pasta which was so salty as to be bordering on inedible and my husband had the bolognese which was ok, but nothing we couldn't have made better at home.  I did enjoy the fact that they had struffoli on the menu for dessert - I've never seen that at a restaurant before!  They were fresh and hot and delicious, but they didn't have enough honey so they weren't very sweet. Even so, they get a bonus point for this!So sadly, I would say that this is a pretty mediocre showing.  I'd go back to have a glass of wine at the bar, but not for dinner.  I have heard from friends that brunch is good though - so maybe I'll give that a try next time.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

But the flavor, OMG, bitter as hell.  The meatballs slightly sweet, but probably was the only good thing on that table tonight.  The lightly fried mussels, were so so.  The grilled octopus, eh :-/ And the ceasar salad w/anchovies, which was made up of some fresh and some browning leaves, anchovies, which tasted like they soaked in vinegar and super hard to get down.  Cocktails ordered - the Basilica and Mr. Amore. Bartendar, where was the alcohol at??? It was a damn Iced Tea and Lemonade for $12 each.  I initially ordered a glass of vino, wish I would have stuck with my first decision.  In total we spent $88 (minus the gratuity).  The service was ok, the only touch of fine dining was the manager stopping by the table to see if everything was okay.  But she had this aura about her that just seemed ingenuine and dead.

Overall, it was not a terrible experience, but I did a few times laugh at some of the comments that came from our waiter throughout the entire dinner. It should be noted, that he seemed like the only person working the restaurant, so I am sure when he has more help, things go much better in terms of service. He was as attentive as possible but as more folks arrived for dinner, he seemed more and more frustrated as the evening went on, which meant our service got slower and slower as the night went on. Some things that we experienced:Most Italian restaurants put bread on the table, this place does not. We had to ask multiple times for more bread. So if you are planning on doing any carb-loading, this is not a place for you. We were told that we had to put in our entire order at the beginning of our order, when we asked if we could have some time to look over the entrees, we were told, you can take a minute and our waiter was serious, he literally came back 1 minute later. He took our appetizer away which was not finished, when we asked him if we could please have the plate of brie back with some bread, he said okay, only to come back and say we would have to pay again for the brie. We told him that he took a full piece of brie from us, he just laughed and walked away. The pasta, well, I have had better. The dessert, well, I have had better.I doubt that this place will stand the test of time in Hoboken, the prices are very high and the food is just average. I believe that most places need to have a signature dish or something that makes a customer want to come back, this place does not in my opinion have that ""wow"" factor just yet.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Asked multiple other times about our entree after continuing to wait. We were told they were busy and it's coming (restaurant was not very busy) soon. Someone else came over and asked if we wanted bread which we never received when we first sat down, and was so generous to offer us a single piece each. Nobody ever asked if we needed more water. We had to ask for everything here. Entrees were never served after an hour and a half so we left and got a slice of pizza at Vito's instead.

I don't eat meat but he seemed to enjoy them. The Burrata was DELICIOUS. I all but licked the plate! The sauce and the bean salad it came with was fantastic. For my entree, I got the scallops. The nut & jam accompaniments truly made the dish; they were an unexpected contrast to the scallops. The scallops could have been seared a touch longer, but altogether were fantastic. Additionally, what I liked was that they had craft beers on tap that I had never heard of before. My husband and I split a light, grapefruit beer. Next time I think I might try one of their small vineyard, strictly Italian, wines. The service was good & the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a decent sized outdoor space.

You were closed for a year but the only changes that were noticeable was the blue wall couch and some light fixtures.  Oh and the counter tables that seem out of place. I have no problem paying for great food but I just didn't get it here. When you charge over 20 dollars for pasta, homemade or not please don't give me 18 gnocchi in an ok pesto. Sure it's uptown Hoboken however understand that Amanda's up the street and Madison down the street offer and 3 course prefix option for a few dollars more then your most expensive pasta.  We did not sample dessert as we were just ready to move on.  Service was fine,  it was early in their opening so they were a bit overly attentive and trying to up sell the menu but I can't knock the hustle. Overall this was a big miss. I just don't think sorrelina understands their market.

86,VCwsP4pvicA2Goht63T6-A,Dion B.,5.0 star rating,"IMPORTANT NOTE when reading these reviews: many people that weren't satisfied recommended going to ""Johnny Pepperoni"" instead. This is apples and oranges. Johnny Pepperoni is yet another ""red sauce"" restaurant in a sea of them in every town in NJ. They are the Italian version of a diner. At best the NJ red sauce resto serves as comfort food when you simply don't feel like cooking yourself -- at best. Sorellina on the other hand is for people with a more refined palate. I didn't find the food overpriced for what I got. The most important key to good Italian food is quality ingredients. They cost money. The next is skill in the kitchen. That costs a little more money as well. I'd rather pay more and love it than lead a mediocre life on a bed of fettuccine alfredo...I read a review that called the burrata ""bland"". Has this person ever had burrata before? There is an ocean of difference between ""subtle"" and ""bland"". If you base a life around sriracha and a salt shaker as a utensil that gets shaken at every bite, sure, you're going to find burrata bland. If you have the time and patience to treat the senses of taste and smell with the same respect you treat the senses of sight and touch then you will find this burrata dish elegant and refined. I loved it.Food-wise I also particularly loved the egg and white bean bruschetta as well as the arancini.Before we get to the wine, how about the beer?! They have EIGHT ITALIAN craft beers, 4 on tap and 4 on bottle. TRY THEM. They are nothing like domestic beers. These are food friendly beers that pair with food like -- if not better than -- wine. The staff was well versed in them so ask for recommendations.Wine-wise I was so excited to see an all Italian list. It hits regions all over the Boot, it offers some classics without compromising quality (yes, there is a Chianti Classico and a Pinot Grigio) as well as some natural/organic wines and some lesser known grape varieties at affordable prices to sample (try the Pecorino).

So simple, but who knew carrots could be that delicious?! For the main dishes we split a few pastas, branzino and cod cheeks. Again, all were very good, but there were two standouts for me. First, the gnocchi in a kale pesto sauce. We all sopped up the rest of the sauce with bread after! Second was the cod cheeks which was cooked perfectly, but my favorite thing on the plate was the ravioli. We asked the waitress about them and she informed us it's not even stuffed with cheese it's celery root! If these were on the menu as their own dish I would happily devour them every time! Contrary to some other reviews I didn't feel the portions were small. If you are used to eating at Olive Garden and the like, then yes, the portions are smaller.

We got a $56 bottle (mid range for there) and it was fantastic.  In total, bill was $120 without tip.  All in all - food is too expensive for what you get, should def knock off $2-4 or increase portions, since the food is not amazing enough for the price tag.  Only negative, albeit a big one.  That said, this is Hoboken, land of mediocrity for a premium.  Will be most likely to come back just for drinks/snacks.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Must have been busy, right? A grand total of zero other patrons dining. In fact there were zero other patrons from what I could tell period. 2 people sitting at the bar, 2 more came later. Way overpriced. Tiny portions. No bread or anything for the table. My pasta was unbearably spicy hot. I'm not a bar person so I don't see myself visiting this place again.

112,WKswKVRs6ApGVtDKmFZZBQ,Rafaello P.,5.0 star rating,"Celebrated my birthday here with my boyfriend and a group of my college friends. My family and I were longtime fans of Helmer's, the traditional German restaurant and bar that occupied the space where Sorellina is located from 1936 when Hoboken had a large German immigrant population right up through three years ago when Helmer's finally closed its doors on New Year's Eve 2014. I was hesitant to make reservations at Sorellina (I was feeling maybe a tad guilty that in doing so, I would be betraying the memory of Helmer's and my family's connections to ""old Hoboken"") however, I had driven past Sorellina several times since it opened and I thought the decor evoked the same warmth and coziness that made Helmer's so lovely. The food menu is full of vegetarian-friendly appetizers and pasta dishes which was perfect for one of our party who eats vegetarian and sometimes vegan. The drink menu had an exciting array of signature and seasonal cocktails as well as an impressive wine list. I called and made a reservation for seven people. Sorellina was extremely flexible about holding the table for us despite the fact that we were running half an hour late and the restaurant was crowded. Our server did a stellar job of making recommendations for both food and drink throughout the evening. From the small plates and snacks section of the food menu, we selected the roasted eggplant dip with corn flatbread for dipping along with two different types of bruschetta (the first being the beets with feta, honey, and pecans, and the second, the spaghetti squash, pignoli, and pumpkin seed). All three of these items were excellent and the spaghetti squash bruschetta was a particular favorite with the squash and pignoli creating a nice contrast of flavors. We also enjoyed the meatballs which were veal-based as well as a cheese and salumi board for which we selected three items - I believe the two cheeses that we chose were the pecorino and the Camembert but I can't remember for certain. For the meat, our server recommended the speck, which tasted like a leaner and less salty version of prosciutto but with similar tenderness. For entrées, all of us selected pasta dishes and we were quite pleased with our choices. Two of us ordered the cacio e pepe. In a departure from the usual long pastas used in this dish such as spaghetti, Sorellina's take on it featured conchiglie (shells). The shape of the pasta allowed the sauce to adhere nicely to it and also made it easier to eat the delicious braised pork which was perfectly cooked and pulled apart easily. Two others at the table also both ordered the mushroom farfalle which was full of complex flavors that blended together seamlessly to make a great fall pasta dish. Other items on the table included the ricotta gnudi (small, round dumpling-like pasta), the kale ravioli, the flavor of which was nicely balanced by the presence of fig in the dish, and the colorful squid ink gigli amatriciana that was reminiscent of a zuppa di peace. From the drink menu, two of us ordered the autumn spritzer, a clear cocktail that include vodka and club soda as well as a few other ingredients and was served with a cinnamon stick. Our friends also ordered wine by the glass, choosing from a broad selection of both reds and whites. Dessert included uniquely flavored gelati as well as different cakes and baked goods accompanied by a long list of apéritifs, dessert cocktails, and espresso-based drinks. Our server was happy to oblige my friends' request to add a candle to my dessert so that we could sing happy birthday. The service was characterized by attentiveness and consistency from the beginning of the meal to the end. I was extremely impressed with the quality and creativity that went into our food and would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone. The menu offers great takes on some Italian favorite while finding a nice middle ground between experimentation and tradition. We will most definitely be back!

The Bronzino does get a little overwhelmed by the cabbage, but overall decent food.  Over halfway through the meal, we made a startling discovery.  There was a piece of broken metal rod in the food almost one inch long.  We looked at each other in horror.  Did we just ingest any metal shards?  How could this happen?  A hair is one thing?  A piece of metal in the food is quite another.  I called the waiter, and he immediately took the plate and said he would talk to the chef and immediately departed never to return.  We waited for a few minutes still flabbergasted.  Finally, I signaled to a waitress to have the chef come out to talk to us.  She hesitated.  I said right now.  She said he is not here tonight.  I said whoever is responsible for the kitchen this evening, please have them come out.  She just walked away.  Eventually, I got the attention of a woman named Agnes who seemed to have some management authority.  She was very apologetic about the situation.  In retrospect, how did she know about the incident and not have approached us sooner.  Why did I have to call to her to get her to talk to us?  I was becoming angry at this point as Agnes continued to repeat herself by sorry a thousand times.  I said Agnes, just stop talking and do the right thing.  She did not know what that was.  I explained to her that this is a safety issue and to pull the dishes from customers who were already being served the same food.  Now, this is the best part.  She explained to me that because the pasta is cooked individually and separately, that there is no chance they could be serving metal to other patrons.  I couldn't take anymore of her stupidity, so I just repeated several times, just bring me the bill, as we want to leave.  The only thing that was prompt this evening was the bill.  I threw some cash down to cover it and walked out.  So, the best part?  Since we shared both plates, we think the metal was actually from the fish dish hidden in all the cabbage.  She just assumed it came from the pasta.  In Agnes' defense, she was a very nice young woman.  Unfortunately, this job is completely over her head.  So, a serious mistake was made, but how they handled it or choose not to handle it, that's what really speaks volumes.  And the kitchen, just wow.  Epic failure.  You have been warned!",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

We managed to order the majority of the menu, and were delighted by the consistent quality and thoughtfulness of the food. Even at 2pm, the restaurant was bustling with a mix of young brunch-ers like my friends and families; all mixed with relative ease. The open space and beautiful spring sunlight pouring through the windows opening on the main street left us with no option other than an immediate round of bloody marys. The large bar proved equal to the task of fortifying our parched lips with a well-balanced brunch classic. Service is prompt and friendly; they are rightly proud of the restaurant and the food. The menu at brunch leans towards the Italian, but with witty touches of classic southern thrown in -- biscuits with apple butter are simple but a must-order to begin your meal. We opened with the aforementioned biscuits and classic Sicilian arancini (also tasty). Brunch progressed via classic egg dishes (Frittata with pasta, which I haven't found outside of Italy, shirred eggs in a house marinara -- both delicious), and split a number of the pastas. From what I tasted, there is no wrong order on the menu. It was the type of meal that leaves one sorry to see it end; in fact, we ordered a bottle of bubbly after desert because we didn't want to leave the food, the ambiance, and the memories of an excellent brunch behind.

121,s6V1X-M5MapSOvoxGlTsnQ,Joseph T.,1.0 star rating,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Hoboken (Besides the waiter, he was great and adorably genuine). We arrived at 5pm on Sunday for our reservation and saw a mostly empty inside seating area. I brought my family including a few that were visiting from out of state, since the aesthetic looked nice and we wanted to try something new. We got our drinks and 25min into sitting, we had received no bread. We only realized that we were supposed to get it once we saw a family next to us get it within minutes of arriving. I asked someone else (not our waiter) for bread and they brought one 6-inch piece of bread in a basket for a group of 10 people. We asked for another basket and received another small piece of bread.. Just enough so we all could have a single chew. We placed our orders with our waiter and then proceeded to wait 30min for appetizers to start rolling out (things like salad, etc..). An 1hr into service, 3 entrees still hadn't been served even though everyone else has finished their food. Echoing the sentiment of other reviewers, these portions are comically small and unnecessarily expensive. Half of our meals were bland, some too spicy -all around, lackluster. After having a quick talk with the owner, she let me know that they were working on the missing entrees. After voicing the other issues, she told me they don't normally get complaints about the food. It's important to remember it took all of these other things going wrong in order for me to feel like it was worth telling her any of the issues. Had it been just the food, I wouldn't have said anything.. But that doesn't mean the food was good/great or anything in between. They removed the 7 drinks from our bill as an apology (not enough to make me want to give them a second chance..). Then we noticed two appetizers on our check that we didn't order, which they had to remove.. The cherry on top!The owner didn't seem genuinely apologetic and proceeded to talk to multiple staffers while staring/pointing at me in reference.

Not to mention I got super sick a few hours later through the entire night.  We didn't have any alcohol and the dinner was $77. Overpriced joke.

Our party arrived at 7:40pm and right inside the front door for 20 minutes to be seated, again with a reservation. There is no where to stand and wait for a table because the space is so tight. The ambiance isn't that charming for a wine bar. If it was a grill it would be more appropriate. I know they did a renovation to the space, but it felt like they gave up half way. Once we sat down, we ordered wine. My friend asked the waiter what the difference was between two white wines she was deciding between. The waiter's response was ""um I have no idea"". Great answer for a place that is marketing themselves as a WINE bar. Moving on to the food: my husband and I shared the meatballs to start - only 3 the size of ping pong balls. They tasted more bland than frozen meatballs. When you order Italian meatballs you expect to get hearty, flavorful, juicy meatballs covered in an excess of delicious red sauce. If that is what you expect then don't order meatballs at Sorellina. Next, my husband and I shared the Carbonara ($25) as our main entree. Again, when you attend a traditional Italian restaurant you expect for the pasta dishes to be overflowing with pasta. Typically one pasta dish can feed two people. When we got the Carbonara we were surprised to find only enough pasta to feed one person, strictly one person. The flavor was actually really good and we enjoyed the 4 bites each that we got. Our friends ordered the Carbonara and the Grilled Branzino($28)  and were happy enough with their meals. They did agree that the portion for the Carbonara left you wanting as they also expected to have left overs. Our overall experience at Sorellina was lacking and we don't plan on going back.

I really want it to hope at my first visit, to finally have a restaurant in Hoboken, place of many stops for my business commute; where I could find a home. well, Oh, it is not. If you are waiting on the stand up bar, for a table, drink lots of water between drinks; it will be a while before you are seated. the SAD story of hoboken ignorance is related to the citizens ( soccer mom and young - I made a million dollar listing professionals - of not supporting weekly businesses ). it seem that everyone has exactly the same auto timer mind: ""got to go for dinner, only on the weekend"" - ""got to be rude when you get there"". I have reason to believe, the owner, a young lady full of energy but short-restaurateur experienced; as one of the waiters described to me the second time I visited: ""she like to control everything"". I think its no one business isn't it?  I personally would let this person go to make these kind of comments. but wait, lets get back to the menu: a simple, easy to read semi-classic italian american fair intermixed with a few main courses. expensive though, yes it is. when you round up your bill at $300 tab, by sampling a few dishes, and a so called - just OK but pricey bottle of wine, nothing excite you other then a few flavors. the gnocchi are too hard rock over dry served with this kale pesto experience packed with salty flavor. I got to give them credit for the Bolognese. the meat in the sauce is good. but the past not so well cooked. Sad. The Chicken, served with this plump risotto like Farro, mushed in a dense sauce, just another chicken dish. The Branzino, fresh, but overcooked, spices are well chosen for the dish, just don't dry it out. Ill limit myself from continuing writing...its probably better. In Summary: * there is a various amount of ingredients on the menu used for many dishes. I can tell they are trying to keep food cost in the mid low grade.* Need improvement for bartender service, right now, its just another bar in town* Wine - No comment - nothing attractive * service, there is room for improvement and attitude* Should review food cost and pasta dishes prices.

136,HsVSepQhRJ-bZ_iJ25hGTg,R M.,3.0 star rating,"I have been here maybe 6 times. Here is an honest review based on what I've tried and the service I have experienced so far. The meat and cheese platter size was offensively sparse for the price that was charged. I have ordered it on 3 separate occasions and each time the quantity given was not consistent and generally smaller each time.The bolognase is a solid dish. Very good. No complaints there. I had the Italian cookies for desert. The priciest desert on the menu I think. And my honest feedback is that it tasted like hard store bought cookies from a supermarket. I had two bites and left the rest on the plate. They should consider removing that desert item. It is not good. Service was fine. No complaints.And lastly, I thinks it's absurd that they don't turn on the televisions. This is not fine dining. They are loosing out on business for people who want to enjoy decent meal at a bar and catch a game after work. BIN 14 has much better food and even they have two small TVs.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

There were 3 bartenders there all very attentive and friendly and let us taste the wines we ordered. My friend ordered the octopus and salad, and I ordered the goat cavateli all were delicious and came out right away. I got my last glass of champagne on the house bc apparently no one ever ordered it so Lucas, one of the bartenders, opened a new bottle. I loved it after drinking the first glass.

140,LnNx_Yfn8NEh2MPmyywQig,Wil J.,4.0 star rating,Overall a great first time experience at Sorellina. The food and service were both excellent. I highly recommend the meatballs as an app or first course. The fried rice balls were also very good. I had the Farfelle pasta with mushrooms which was excellent. My wife had the halibut which was very good. The portions were decent size. The wine options were very good .The reason for the 4 stars was the lame portions we got on the homemade gelato. For 4 bucks you should get more than a few tablespoons.  Despite that the experience was great.,Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
141,iCC9VAzh7YAQBA488_xAPg,Clyde G.,5.0 star rating,"What a great addition to the Hoboken dining scene! A lovely renovation/update/ upgrade of the old Helmers space. A very attentive staff led by the owner (Gabi Lombardi)and the GM (Victor Biancamano) Our server (also Victor) was attentive and knowledgeable and very friendly.   We arrived early on a Friday night hoping to grab a quick drink at the bar, but they were already packed. No problem.. There communal tables by the bar, so we stood for a drink which was fine. Before we finished our drink the very alert hostess offered us the option of sitting down early at our table. Nice!  The menu offers a number of options as to how you eat. Interesting apps, tasty small plates/ antipasti, a variety of homemade pastas and an array of entrees. Our party took different paths.    On the antipasti side, we tried the meatballs and the polenta , plus the grilled octopus, roasted carrots, and the pecan pesto burrata. All well composed and delicious. One could make a great meal out just the antipasti... But you'd miss a lot.   In the entree category, the Branzino and the Bisteca were great presentations and extremely favorable. All the food came immediately out of the kitchen once plated. Everything that should have been was quite hot. Just no misses here and these folks have been open just 2-3 weeks. Gabi is a certified sommelier and it shows in her excellent selection of Italian wines; quite a selection across a spectrum of price options. So a lovely experience put on by real pros.

144,QhxZKlQPgbPEq6fqyFfcNw,Monica K.,3.0 star rating,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, we were a table of four. I've been super excited to try out this place since we really need more date night spots and less bar food in Hoboken. Started off with a prosecco (obviously) and a cheese and meat plate. A little disappointed with the cheese selection to be honest. I love my cheese so I wish I saw a few more options up my alley but you win some you lose some. No complaints on the meat plate. Next we ordered two octopus apps. Both came out so ridiculously burnt you couldn't even see what you were eating. Coming the restaurant business myself I wouldn't have even brought that out. The server took it back and brought us back a new order which still was so crispy it didn't taste like octopus. Next we ordered the carrots and squash both just ok. We then shared the burrata and the scallops. Burrata was excellent and the scallops were just good. The service was ok, a little on the slower side. Overall it was decent but there is definitely room for improvement. Will try it out again once they work out all the kinks considering they just opened.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

147,c24MAdryYT0NC0NzHYscyw,Kelly F.,3.0 star rating,"This was a much anticipated new addition to the neighborhood that happens to fall short - the price is very high for the food/experience and the service needs a major overhaul. I live on the same block as Sorellina and since I commute to Manhattan via the 11th St bus I pass by this restaurant daily...Hence I was SO EXCITED to have a new option in uptown Hoboken and I followed the progress for what was close to a year. They published the menu ahead of time and the food looked like a major winner!! Gourmet Italian small plates is what this place is about and the decor/vibe definitely mirrors this. Unfortunately the food and service do not match up. My husband and I went the day after they had their grand opening and had an ""ok"" time - we got the meatballs (an Italian place has to have good meatballs?!),arancini, and a couple of pastas. The food was not its best, it took a long time to get drinks, and we were served the wrong pasta dish. However I have to say whatever pasta we got was good!I chalked it up to a new restaurant working out its kinks and we vowed to give it another go for Valentine's Day (Sunday night). Again slow service (took 30 mins for a glass of wine) and mediocre food (between this visit and the last I believe we tried most of the menu,the gnocchi was the only standout). I watched food going to the wrong tables, waiters in complete disarray- I also watched a waitress deliver three glasses of wine to a table, two with a normal pour and one which looked there was 1oz of wine in  the glass - I was shocked the customer didn't send it back!! Our waiter told us to come back when it was less busy so he can take better care of us. The wait staff here needs some major improvement, however I will say that the manager on duty was very attentive and did her best to cover what was obviously a small disaster happening around her. I really wanted this restaurant to work, I really did. Unfortunately I don't think we will be coming back for a long time, the price range ($100+ dollars for a meal) is just not doable for everyday and we don't have it in our budget to keep ""experimenting"". Hoping in the future this establishment can put the pieces together because it has the makings of being a great place!",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
148,WomU9n6ZGuUXr5_7P5JfUQ,Laura M.,5.0 star rating,"Finally a real italian restaurant in Hoboken! I moved here from Italy 10 years ago and Sorellina is the first Hoboken restaurant truly inspired by authentic italian food. Obviously they have their own take on it and I think it's great. Even greater it is the extensive but easy to navigate all italian wine list. You can pick from staples, but I recommend to get adventurous and taste many of the indigenous grape varieties offered even by the glass! This place doesn't cut corners regarding their thoughts with the beverage program. Their selection of Italian craft beers is impressive, my favorite was the Scarliga European Double IPA from Birrificio Rurale, but I only sampled a couple. They also have a Negroni bar and I think it's a super fun way to celebrate the most famous italian cocktail. Also this place is nicely designed and welcoming, the staff is very knowledgable. For the people that complained about waiting too long on weekends....I don't quite understand the complaint, if there is no room there is no room, correct? After living in NYC for years I (unfortunately) learned that eating out was best and easiest on weekdays.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

150,Io1ovnRk1JJgAcLtxHDlgg,Lauren A.,2.0 star rating,"I'll start off my saying I'm a pretty tough critic. I work in a high end restaurant in the city under a Michelin Star chef. Upon being sat inside (the restaurant is pretty) we were greeted by the server and started on some drinks. Both of which were very good- the Basilica (vodka cocktail) and another cocktail of Gin Mare. Drinks were strong with great flavor. I'd go back here strictly for cocktails. We ordered olives and arancini to start. The olives were $6 and literally the worst, most tasteless olives I've ever had. How you can screw up olives, I'm not sure. There were maybe 9-10 giant olives on the plate of different colors and all were awful. There was none of the normal olive saltiness to them. There were maybe four small olives which tastes okay. It was bizarre. The arancini had fava beans mixed into the rice/cheese mixture- odd again. Then a duck pate was served complimentary. Neither of us ate it since of dietary preferences were never asked in the beginning and I don't eat duck. We decided not to order mains from here and just finish our cocktails. Great potential, but missing the mark. Cute decor!",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
151,YUUYcUQOoz69SVDxwIEckw,Michael G.,1.0 star rating,"Went in last night for dinner. Had a nice bottle of wine and the server informed us that they were out of the pappardelle bolognese and the puttanesca. We ordered the grilled lamb tortellini and the carbonara. The carbonara was over seasoned with pepper and had hardly any flavor with a broken sauce. The tortellini were 5 to an order and also bland. For over $20 per pasta was very unimpressed. Asked for more bread and never received any. The table next to us got the pappardelle and I told the manager our server told us they were out of that item and the manager said the chef ""found"" more and did nothing for us to rectify the situation. Completely unacceptable.  We will never come back and I do not recommend paying that much for less than mediocre pasta. Stay at home and make it yourself. You'll save 100 bucks. Or go to Olive Garden. We were still hungry when we got home and I literally made a pastina with pancetta and garlic with some parmigiana and a whole egg and it was far better.",Sorellina,3.5 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

We were told 40 mins wait, totally understandable. Well, we weren't sat until after 8:30, you do the Math. The service for drinks while waiting was soooooo slow. And it didn't get any better. I don't know if they are going for a ""European"" feel, but this isn't Europe. I mean, I don't want to be rushed out, but I'd like some more water, please? Definitely another drink, please. We'd like to see the dessert menu, please. Can we have our check now,.... PLEASE. It was just, ugh. And! There was SO much staff. I'm so confused. The food- we started with all three of the bruschetta options, all good. But again the service was so slow we just moved right to dinner. The pasta portions were tiny especially for the price. I had the bolognese, it was really good and actually decently portioned. Others had the veal agnolotti and it was tasty but HOLY was it a small portion.. Like, tiny. Both ladies were still hungry... For $28.00, that's disappointing. Another had the pasta in kale & pesto, she really enjoyed it but said it was unexpectedly spicy. For dessert- the Apple crumb with ice cream was yummy and the assorted cookie plate was pretty good just wished someone had walked us through what everything on the plate was. Overall, the decor and feel is nice, warm. But the staff is not attentive, a bit frazzled even. The food is mediocre for the prices. And the wine selection is, meh.
