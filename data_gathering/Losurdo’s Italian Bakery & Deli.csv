8,ZZELut-m0rSyivf8saCMKA,Mark S.,4.0 star rating,"A healthy Italian Deli in Hoboken? Who knew?  I have been a fan of their mozzarella since I went to the Hoboken Mutzfest in January. I finally had a chance to go back today after my initial visit about three weeks ago was thwarted by their being closed on Mondays. They have whole wheat and gluten free options which I like and don't normally see in Italian Delis. I ordered two sandwiches. My standard prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar. The other sandwich was roasted turkey and Swiss cheese with lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar. Even though I was looking forward to my sandwich I let it marinate for a couple of hours so the bread got nice and spongy.   The place smells awesome when you walk in, with baked bread and pastries. I also had to bring home some of their delicious fresh mozzarella. The prices are pretty standard, about 8 dollars a sandwich. I have had larger, but, THIS IS THE BEST MUTZ I HAVE HAD.

Luckily, the Losurdo brothers continue Tony's Italian Bakery's tradition of baking fresh bread daily. Plain or sourdough, all kinds of shapes and sizes. Walking in the bakery you'll almost always hear Italian being spoken by one of the guys or old-time customers. Losurdo sandwiches are always packed with lots deli meats. Not as much as Carnegie Deli 1-pounders, but still more than enough. They stock both imported and domestic meats, my favorite being a hot Calabrese salami which I'd order by the 1/2 pound sliced, and then sliced again down the middle or it'd be too big for crackers. It is simply the hottest, spiciest salami I've found in the Six Boroughs (haha). They also have a good assortment of pickled items, imported Italian pasta, cookies and goods, cheeses and fresh mozzarella.

Living and working only a block away from this gem is great for when I'm looking for a meaty deli sandwich during lunch hours or buying cold cuts and fresh baked bread on Sunday morning for breakfast. The deli sandwiches are definitely the highlight of this place. Whether it be their cold sandwiches like fresh mozzarella and turkey sandwich with roasted peppers or a hot sandwich like their chicken cutlet, you're guaranteed to leave full. They do not skimp on the meat. They offer a great selection of domestic and imported deli meats and their bread is freshly baked on site. They also sell pizza on Thursday and Friday that is a must try and is only $2 per slice or $4 for small personal pie which is very rare in Hoboken to find pizza this good for that price. They also have a great selection of Italian pastas, seasonings, and pastries. They offer catering services for special events and have great daily specials. The staff is always accommodating and attentive. Prices are more than fair with sandwiches ranging from $7 to $9. Price of deli meat and bread depends on what kind you get and how much of it.
