0,o4pa6evMXKHw8J-_YZ9fHQ,Jackie G.,5.0 star rating,"Great new spot, my Aussie husband was in heaven. We tried 3 different pies, sausage roll & coffee. All where excellent & we were even able to get frozen pies to make at home. Plenty of parking out front. FYI-the tip on this page that says they are not open on Sunday is incorrect.",Gold Roast Cafe,5.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Australian"
1,a7Zis6KZ1w0F7agD48dAYQ,Jay H.,5.0 star rating,"Update: I love this coffee shop. I'm always greeted like a friend as soon as I walk in the door. The atmosphere is super chill like a day on the Australian coast. You'll find the staff has a laid back attitude but they're no slouch when it comes to taking your order seriously. If you're having a stressful day this is certainly a great place to unwind. The coffee beans they use are fantastic! Locally sourced from another Australian native who now lives in Brooklyn.I've worked my way down most of the menu and I can tell you that your stomach will thank you for trying any of it. The pastries are all expertly made and extremely delicious. Today I had a meat pie and don't let the name put you off it was the right start to my day. Don't forget the chipotle mayo on the side! I've also had the brekky sandwich and this is a must try.If you come in during lunch they've got you covered with sandwiches galore.Today I tried the turmeric latte with cinnamon and it was sooo delicate in flavor. Not the big punch in the face like I was expecting. Henry who owns the place definitely knows what he's doing.Don't forget when you're checking out to sign up for their rewards program, I got $5 my purchase today!",Gold Roast Cafe,5.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Australian"
2,DVg-JR7THCrNtZJU522Pqw,Courtney S.,5.0 star rating,"Finally a great cappuccino in Hoboken! We both had some cappuccinos with chocolate on top, truly Aussie style. We haven't tasted coffee this good since we were in Australia. It felt like were back in a Melbourne cafe. The food was authentic as well. We had a brekkie sandwich (egg and avocado served on a croissant from a local Hoboken bakery with chipotle mayo - delish!) and a brekkie pie (bacon, egg, and cheese). The service was friendly and top notch! We look forward to returning again soon for some great coffee and authentic Aussie bites to eat.",Gold Roast Cafe,5.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Australian"
