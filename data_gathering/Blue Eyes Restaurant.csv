Arrived for an early dinner at 5:30, immediate seating at a table overlooking the river and Manhattan.Waiter was really nice and friendly. I had a glass of wine. We ordered calamari/shrimp appetizer. Though breaded and fried, it was delicious and very tender.I had the gnocchi with a special request of vodka sauce.

I was skeptical because of the reviews but we really wanted a nice view and to be close to the water.They don't take reservations. We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday. There was only two parties ahead of us. We were seated in a about 20minutes. The restaurant has an inside which seems pretty small and an outdoors that is covered with a canopy. We sat outside. Started with the Calamari , shrimp and zucchini app. It was MY fav! Just wish there were a few more shrimp. For dinner we were both in basic moods and got chicken parm. I usually order mine with sauce of the side of the spaghetti. They misunderstood and they gave me mine sauceless (that's ok!). The sauce turned out being soooooo delicious.

Our waiter was an older man, very nice, very Italian. We felt as if were back in Venice. As our waiter gave us time to think about our order, another gentleman came around and was giving a champagne tasting. Of course, my bf and I tried it and loved it, so we got a bottle. As our app, we ordered the Burrata Pugliese. As our entrees, I got the Linguine Nere with shrimp and my boyfriend got the steak dish. My bf was raving about his delicious meal and my pasta was perfect. I wish I had some more now! All the food was amazing! Food was a 5 for us and so was the service.

Food was good but not necessarily mind blowing - it was the overall experience I enjoyed. ""Blue Eyes"" was Frank Sinatra's nickname. Hoboken is also the birthplace of Sinatra, so the combo is fitting. Fall time in NYC / Hoboken is a magical time. You piece that all together, and a meal along the Hudson River in fall with Frank Sinatra playing in the background as you watch the sun set against the Manhattan Skyline is quite the experience.Food: Mezzalune di Spinaci e Ricotta Pasta was not bad, but again not worth the trip just for the food. We also all tried a piece of the Diavola pizza which was doughy and well made.I pass this spot on my runs all the time and always seems to have a steady flow of customers.

That's what stood out to me the most about this spot when we were looking for a restaurant on the water this past Saturday night. It stands out as the closest to the water in Hoboken, and I assumed that would mean it would be PACKED on a beautiful Saturday night at dinnertime - but we had no wait. I even called ahead and was nervous when they said they don't take reservations for less than 3 people, but we had no issue siting right along the open windows outside, closest to the views. On one side you see the Empire State Building (partially blocked by a baseball field net) and on the other side a perfect view of World Trade and the financial district. For a casual night out, this place is definitely on the pricier side - probably the reason it wasn't as packed as it could have been. $17 for an app of fried calamari with a few pieces of fried shrimp and fried zucchini thrown it. My bf got a ceasar salad ($13)- small portion for a dinner salad. I went with a pasta entree because I love pesto - Garganelli con Patate e Gamberetti al Pesto (Egg penne shaped pasta with potatoes and shrimp in a pesto sauce) for $20. Pretty good pasta, only a few pieces of shrimp and I didn't think the potatoes were necessary in the dish, would have been better if there was just more shrimp for the price. Not terrible entree prices and glass of wine is only $7, but can definitely find cheaper elsewhere for the quality and portions. Total cost still came out to $70 + tip.

The person who sat us was very nice and gave us a great seat in perfect view of the Hudson River and the fireworks coming from NYC.The bread they gave us after we ordered was bland and nothing special. One of my stars is because of the great value of the wine. A craffe of wine ( almost two glasses) is fifteen dollars. Great value! I ordered the Margarita Pizza and the vegetable pizza that had tomatoes, broccoli rabe, sauce and cheese. Both of these pies were TERRIBLE. No flavor. No taste. Pizza dough was doughy and not crispy.

We skipped dessert and ordered two espressos and one Nutella cappuccino.  I got to sample the cappuccino and you can really taste the Nutella!  If you like Nutella, the cappuccino is the way to go.  Wonderful service + delicious food = A great restaurant.",Blue Eyes Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Cafes,, Italian"

Hoboken's hottest bars on the water are within walking distance. Location aside, this place has the most genuine staff and the freshest ingredients. If you've been to Italy then you will notice the similarity.

We were quickly seated when we arrived and ordered within 10 minutes. After (approx) 1 hour and 35 minutes+ later our main course arrives. The waiter and waitress were very apologetic about the wait time -- the offered us wine and gelato while we waited, which was kind. When the food finally arrived it was underwhelming from the calamari rubbery texture to the brick oven (soggy) pizza. The spaghetti and meatball was decent but I get the same quality at my local pizzeria for the fraction of the price. I kind of expected better at a restaurant. Overall it was a ""meh"" experience.

53,EzbuXWq9S5J1iF1u6tABBA,Kevin K.,2.0 star rating,Not sure how other reviewers can even rate above a 3. The biggest draw just seems the location with the NYC skyline view. And even that wasn't even impressive.Service was friendly and DYI. Which means the  server kindly hands you your glass or plate of food rather than placing it on the table. I don't mind lending a hand in tight spots but this was not the case.Pizza was blah. Nothing special. For dessert we tried the cannoli pie. Had no idea that this was just some filling on top of the same horrible pizza dough. Awful. Other desserts were all pre-made from a national supplier. No luck there either.If you're looking for a great meal in town look elsewhere.

Pulling out the chairs for both my wife and I, addressing us as Signore and Signora. For our order, we came up with two types of Napolitano pies which are about the size of a dinner plate.  Still coming in 8 slices, enough to satisfy us plus leave leftovers. The first pie was the Prosciutto Pie, Prosciutto di Parma, shaved parmigiano cheese and arugula.  Our next pie was the Carrettiera, broccoli rabe, sausage and buffalo mozzarella.   Now I will admit I am a bit of a pizza snob so to me the pies were ok.  But, of the two I enjoyed the Prosciutto better.  I thought the Carretiera was a little under cooked for my taste.   As you picked it up and folded it wasn't firm.  Perhaps another couple of minutes in the oven would have made the difference.

We sat outside on a beautiful, warm day.  I love living in NJ and being close to NYC.  As a life long New-Yorker... The skyline never fails to impress and excite me.  The staff was also very pleasant and accommodating. For example, we returned our Sangria because we were not aware of the lack of alcohol in the mix/restaurant.  The Bad:  There is no hard liquor.  Beer and wine?  Yes.  Liquor? Sadly, no. The Sangria was a sorry mix of wine and club soda.  The Ugly: The food was really bad.  The American Pizza tasted like a Sausage McMuffin with Egg from McDonald's, except not as good.  The Grilled Octopus was tasteless and soggy.  The best part of my meal was the bottled beer.  Were I ever to return, it would be to drink a $6 Peroni and soak in a Million Dollar view!Update to review in response to the response from the restaurant.  Hello Nicole R. Of Blue Eyes.  Thanks for your reply and explanation of the liquor license.  I should have been more clear in my critique.  I wish that we had been informed about your lack of liquor before ordering AND returning the Sangria.  Had we not returned the Sangria, we would have most definitely returned the octopus (which we only took one bite of).  It's been my experience that restaurants would ask one of two things when an uneaten entree is being cleared from a table.  1. Would you like that boxed up to go; or, 2. Was there something wrong with the dish. Neither was asked so I made the assumption that we weren't the first to not eat more than one bite and that even your wait staff knows that no one would want to take that tasteless crap home.",Blue Eyes Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Cafes,, Italian"

This place is located at a great place for a beautiful view of the city and also for the contest grounds. Now onto the food!Let's start with the bread, kind of super hard and not too flavorful but I did like that it came with a chimichurri sauce. For starters we had the grilled octopus and eggplant parm. The grilled octopus had a great char while retaining a nice juicy texture plus nice flavor. The eggplant parm was amazing! Served in a hot casserole with melted parm and roasted eggplant wonderful flavor.Lowlights are the slow service because our waiter forgot our order but he sort of made amends by hooking us up with a free pizza. The pizza was a classic margherita and had good cheesiness.

I asked him if there were any drink or food specials he said it's in the menus and walked away. And then watched us from behind like a hawk until we ordered. Mind you there only 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. Another table sat next us thy brought out some bread and butter for them and told them about there specials for the night like wtf??? The tables next to me were all white Iam Indian hmmmm I wonder if that had anything to do with that. And my check was a decent check for 2 adults and 1 month old baby 85.75Maybe they should not judge a book by its cover not all Indian are cheep and some do spend more money then others. For the 1st time in my life I tipped a tip that was fully deserved.Nicole respond to your comment. You could try to assure me this had nothing to do with race, but when the waiter gives the table next to u bread, specials, and friendly service, and gives your family (who's dining with a baby on her 1st birthday) terrible service and neglect, please be assured I will not return there to allow Alessandro the opportunity to spit in my food.

Flavorless bolognese, tough chicken parm, and the $20 pie w mushrooms, prosciutto and truffle oil was gross, and I effing love pizza. No oil, mostly sauce, barely any cheese or mushrooms, and slabs of prosciutto that was so tough the whole piece flies off the slice when you try to bite into it. Service: needs a lot of work.

Who goes out to eat and wanted to listen to speeches for a dinner they aren't attending, not me. There was no divider.

78,3MsvlOQJp7pWxOkBzjUe7A,Thea Z.,3.0 star rating,"Nice place but it still has a lot of work to do with regard to service and quality of food. This was a tough one to rate since different aspects of my visit varied in ratings from 2-5, so I settled on a 3 because overall, it was just ok. Highlights are the view and pleasant people that work there, lowlights are the food and the organization of service, both which can be fixed in time. Food: My biggest source of disappointment. It started off well with some flat bread and dipping oil, but then it was all downhill. My colleague's salmon was good and salad was very average, mostly lettuce, 1 piece of cucumber, and 1 cherry tomato. My artichoke soup was overly creamy for a summer soup though had a nice flavor but the worst of it all was the eggplant parmesan. Woof! It looked like they served me a TV dinner from the 60's and boy george it tasted even worse than it looked. The eggplant was not cooked and the sauce is horrendous. Sinatra would not like that something so gross was served at a place with his namesake. I think what made it worse was when I expressed my dislike at the end, they gave me a whole new order to take home - who does that! It wasn't good the first time, why would I want more! I gave it to my colleague to eat for dinner and he came in the next day saying how it was the grossest thing he has ever eaten! Blue Eyes - please nix this or change it up. Ambiance: I have to say, its a little odd the way they have chosen to decorate the place. I love the style, but doesn't seem to fit with the ""Sinatraesque/Italian"" vibe that they are going for. You picking up what I am putting down? When I looked at the inside I pictured swanky waterfront wine bar. Maybe they have set it up as a backup plan in case the Italian thing doesn't work out, it'll be easier to re-open. The view though, that is spectacular. Service: Our waiter was the sweetest guy. Very pleasant which added to the experience. Except, not the sharpest tool. Perhaps this was his first gig as a waiter. We ordered the lunch special which was supposed to start with soup or salad. My soup came at the same time as my entree and my colleague got nothing. For about 5 minutes. Then came his entree, but no salad. Asked for that 3 times before it came. Each time he was nice about it, but a bit odd when there are few people at the restaurant (4 tables of people). At the end when he asked how our food was and I had expressed my disappointment he was all apologetic and offered to get me more. I declined and he apologized numerous times. Then he sent out the manager and he also offered me more food. Again I declined, really just wanted to give them feedback. They were very sweet and brought out some ice cream for my colleague and I, in a shared dish with 2 spoons. Good thing I know my colleague well lol.I can feel ok recommending this place because really you know you are going for the view and perhaps some average food.

He's always around greeting guests and making sure theyre getting the best service. Casual dining but their food is high quality. Some of my favorites are classics done right-- Fried Calamari Diavola and Pasta al Forno. For pizza, I'd highly, highly recommend the Tartufata. Topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto, mushrooms and truffle oil. This pie is so addicting you'll go back for seconds, thirds, forths.

The pizza was great for eat-in, got a bit soggy after sitting for awhile so take out maybe tricky. Salad was good. Panini was ok because bread was too crispy and I don't eat meat so they added mutz. Flavor was good but it was a bit lacking in the center. Suggestions: There should be at least one veggie option for panini. Also, option of grilled salmon to add to salad would be good for pescetarians. Biggest thing is that it's a bit pricy for lunch so maybe consider adding lunch specials to the menu.

You can share it as an appetizer just like in a neighborhood trattoria back in the old country, 'cause this is our neighborhood and FINALLY some authentic and good Southern Italian fare has landed here. Thank God.The exceptional lasagna is designed to send you home with lunch for tomorrow and the green salad is like grandma's with the little bitty extras like marinated mushrooms, roasted redpeppers, olives and the teeniest slivers of red onion. The added bonus is NOT being killedwith TOO MUCH GARLIC so the taste of real food can show its teeth. Most of the wait staff speak Italian and are super welcoming. And yes, when it gets busy, you might wait an extra minute or two for a refill on your water, but just pretend you're in Italy on vacation insteadof at a stressful midtown Manhattan lunch on a Monday.

There was seating for us inside, but did not allow us to sit inside, the inside had his Italian, what looked like, connect people if you know what I mean, which I assume pushed us outside.  Our almost 30 guys that came from over an hour car ride away were freezing outside.  They charged us the $200 deposit and for the liquor we had drank, but we could not even stay for dinner since they took so long to server us.  The picture shows all white with black chairs, but it was crappy outside seat chair that they put us on.  This was one of the worst experiences at a restaurants I have had in a long time.  Warning - do not go there.  Oh one other time I went with my sister, and she ordered pizza, but it turned out to be salad on a pizza, which what just as horrible.  Outside of the view - stay away!",Blue Eyes Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Cafes,, Italian"

First of all, it seems that there were about 7 people working the floor but each seemed to have their own responsibility and only one of the 7 waited on tables. It took forever to have our order taken, and even before it was, they were trying to give us someone else's food. They tried to give my salad to the table next to us. It just seemed to be hectic (even though the place was not crowded).I ordered a lunch special which comes with soup or salad. When I asked what soups they had, the waiter shook his head and said ""Oh, not today"". So salad it was. My coworker ordered lasagna. It was on the menu for $18. She knew it was pricey for lunch but hadn't had lasagna in a while and was craving it. When it came, it was a regular size dinner plate filled with marinara with a tiny rectangle of lasagna. She questioned the fact that it was so small and was told that, yes, that was what she ordered. When she complained again about the fact that it was $18, the waiter ""investigated"" in the kitchen and she was finally told that it was because it's a lunch portion and not a dinner. Needless to say, we asked to be charged a lunch price for the lunch portion. Luckily, we were. The pasta was way too al dente. She did not enjoy it at all. Silly complaint and I know that there are some (not many) places that do this but I'm mentioning it anyway. I am a soda drinker. No free refills at Blue Eyes. I could easily run up a double digit tab in sodas, which I feel is crazy when it's out of the tap.With bad service and bad food that is way overpriced, we will sadly not be visiting Blue Eyes again.

I haven't had Italian in awhile.. Such a let down. The server didn't really know how to answer my food questions, that's a bad sign.  I've been in the restaurant business for years, servers should know the menu inside and out. The menu is short, no excuses. When I sat they sent out bread and a flavored oil to dip. The bread was hot. I enjoyed it. The dipping oil however was just basically oil. The stuff at the bottom wasn't really easy to get to as it was at the bottom of a small ramekin. I feel like the oil and stuff was just mixed together because the oil didn't really hold the taste of what was in there. That should be re worked abit. Love the idea though!The salad was good.. I found Afew pieces of brown lettuce but it happens.. That wasn't that bad. Although I was basically the only person there so maybe they could have checked it abit better.. I enjoyed the dressing. Was a basic balsamic, seasoned well. Maybe they could add abit more of the cucumber and tomato and not cut it so small. Hard to grab with the fork. My calamari had 3 pieces of cartilage in it. THREE. Probably more but I stopped eating it after that.. Disgusting. The sauce for the calamari was ok, bland. Could use some spice it more salt. My spaghetti was raw. I was told its ""al dente"" no. It was raw, I'm a professional chef, so I know.. However you don't have to be a professional to know when you chew your pasta and it literally crunches in your mouth, it's raw. Al dente is abit of a bite, not a literal crunch. It needed atleast another two Minutes in the boiling water. The meatballs were cold and super small.. Again, I'm the only one there besides one other table.. Ridiculous. I couldn't order dessert because frankly I didn't eat much so I feel as though I didn't deserve dessert. Plus I was scared of how that would be. No one came for about 15 minutes so I walked into the ""house"" to pay. Got upto the front by the register and a man who I believe is the owner or one of the owners ""greeted"" me with ""yea?""  So I replied ""hello, do I pay here?"" And his response was ""pay for what?"" So I replied ""for my meal that I didn't eat because it was horrible""He walked away. My server ran over, she was nice. Didn't change me for the calamari that I almost choked on so that was good.. As I walked out I saw a table that had pizza, maybe I'll try that before I write this place off for good but still unsure if I'll return. Too bad. I hope it's just because they're new and getting the hang of things.

I ate the clams and the Eggplant Rollatini. Surprisingly, I've concluded that the Rollatini is what got me sick. My boyfriend shared the clams with me and he was fine. Our waitress told us that they had lost their Chef this week and the Owner had to cook all the food himself. She also told us that he has no kitchen experience. He clearly had no business cooking last night and they should have closed for the night, rather than serving poisonous food. I was sick for hours and am still not fully recovered. This afternoon I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager and he insisted that I was wrong and that the owner is the chef and he is ""very on top of his food."" I told him that I highly doubt that, because the waitress explained that the owner had no kitchen experience. I am extremely offended by the fact that they could not own up to their mistake and acted like I was making this up. After all I had been through, calling me wrong was extremely unprofessional on their part.

So no meal but free pastry how long will that take. *Update after another wait they comped the cold entree. I wanted to like the place.

Ordered the calamari, shrimp and zucchini- the zucchini was the best part and very tasty but you definitely need a side of marinara sauce to bring flavors to the others. Also had the Parma pizza (Parmesan, arugula, prosciutto)- it was ok but also need more flavor. Wine is average and limited options.

The table next to us, a party of 8, came in after we had already placed our order, all ordered pizza, and received their pizza significantly before us (a party of 2). We had the same waiter. We ordered calamari and a margherita pizza. The calamari was soggy and overpriced. Our pizza was also soggy, and watery.

Once the manager noticed we'd been waiting a while he brought the waiter over immediately & apologized for the delay. After that both the manager and our waiter were very attentive. I ordered the eggplant rollitini which came with spaghetti and my friends both got the grilled salmon with a side Caesar. My eggplant was good their salmon though was pretty bland. Their complaint was that there was no real seasoning to the fish. They were a bit disappointed. The manager came over and offered to buy us dessert. We got the the Nutella pizza which was phenomenal.

The detractions are par for the course; it's a small space and exterior seating feels somewhat ""bolt-on"" in the winter months.

We waited far too long, and half the table receive their dinner as the other half had already finished theirs. For the price, this is just unacceptable. The waitress did mention that they had a new head chef and a new menu, but it appears that they still may need to keep looking. Be aware that some of the older pictures on yelp, maybe of dishes that are no longer offered (such as chicken parm). For a restaurant named after Sinatra I also wish it had a more Sinatra vibe- more intimate, actual Sinatra music and maybe more pics of him or music theme items.

My boyfriend and I arrived at a busier hour on a Saturday night and were quickly seated. However, our waitress did not have her hair tied and in the food industry that is a HUGE no no. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, Chicken Parm and a pizza. The glasses were not polished and when receiving wine service it is basic courtesy to present a clean glass. On the upside the food arrived promptly, yes. We were starving and had to get food in our systems before heading to NYC. The pizza was appealing on the eyes BUT I did not understand why the toppings were only placed on ONLY half of the pizza???? Regardless due to our hunger we did not complain and just ate continued to eat.. The toppings on the pizza were fresh but the dough was raw and floppy, it was a poor excuse of a pizza. The Chicken Parm lacked UMPH.. and there was no spoon for the spaghetti or a steak knife for the chicken.

I wanted to like it so badly because the location and ambiance are so charming. Unfortunately, the food is generally tasteless and the service, though friendly, was so awful that I couldn't help but laugh at one point. We were greeted by a very nice man, who I believe is the owner, who sat us quickly - it was downhill from there. No one gave us menus, three different servers came over with food/drinks we didn't even order...STILL no one gave us menus...and then the server cleaning the table next to us sprayed cleaning solution all over us (he was super apologetic, but this should have been an instant warning sign). Finally, we were given menus and placed our orders. When the food arrived, it was cold and basically had no flavor at all. Throughout the meal, confused-looking servers continued to come outside and try to give us food and beverages that were not ours. Meanwhile, I continued to ask for our server so I could send back the terrible food. I finally flagged someone down, who was very apologetic when I explained that the food was awful. Because we'd been waiting for so long at that point, I wasn't even hungry anymore and just asked for the check. After TWENTY MINUTES and reminding FIVE separate servers, we STILL didn't have our check and a server decided to bring out a piece of chocolate cake ""compliments of the house"". While this was a nice gesture, we explained that we'd been trying to leave for almost half an hour at this point and really didn't want any cake - we just wanted to get the heck out of there! FINALLY, our check was brought to the table and the owner/manager came out to say he was ""sorry for being nice""....not a great touch when you've royally screwed up a local's experience at your place of business, my friend.All in all...this was one of the most ridiculous and horrendous dining experiences I've ever had, and I would warn (and have warned!) anyone I know not to even bother with it.

It was Lambada dessert in my mouth! My family might not have finished their entrees but they sure licked, clean, the dessert plates. I also have to mention their Nutella Cappucino, and man, I was strucked how good it was! I wish they could've served it in a mug and not a tea cup.

The entire staff seemed to be Italian - for example, our server was born in Sicily.Also the service was great. You can tell they are really cooking with their hearts and just want the customers to be happy. We had several staff helping us throughout our meal, all ensuring we were satisfied. My husband got the lasagna and it was absolutely amazing. I got a panini- also really good. I want to also reiterate this was their first day of service. I usually expect a restaurant to take a few weeks to get set up, and always anticipate a little chaos in the beginning. I was blown away by the quality of both food and service .

The serving sizes weren't huge either one of those pizza's with toppings is $19 and it looks like a personal pie when you get it. Plain pizza is $16 I believe.  BUT I do have to say it was delicious. It all depends on how much money you're looking to spend. Location also ups the price a bit. My date and I ordered their appetizer sampler ( I forget the name), Penne Vodka, and Prosciutto Pizza. The vodka sauce was nice and light. The appetizer was pretty good too. The only thing that actually really annoyed me was that they said they couldn't put vodka sauce on the prosciutto pizza instead of tomato sauce. Now I'm not sure if the pizza was premade or if the pizza guy just didn't know how to do it but I didn't ask. Hopefully he wasn't just being lazy because there was only one other couple in the place but honestly it didn't matter because the pizza really was delicious. Just expensive.

The owner came to me and my date for that day with such a warm and welcoming vibe. You know this place is amazing when the staff treats you like family. Will I come back here? Absolutely, I plan to take all my dates here. Yes. All of them. Am I womanizer? Maybe, but that's not the point.

We told the waiter and he reacted as though we couldn't have done great damage if one of us were to swallow it. When we told him that he took away the two slices left from our margarita pie(which was so delicious), we wanted to bring those slices home with us and he took them without even asking if we were done or wanted them wrapped. He came back out after a couple of minutes and let us know that he took the pasta off of our bill because of the thumb tack.The thumb tack pasta was ok tasting(yes we ate a good amount before realizing). And the pizza was really great. Because of the location(on the water) and the pizza I might actually be back even after the thumb tack incident.",Blue Eyes Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Cafes,, Italian"

174,qgEV8CGH1qHal9mwJQ8oMA,Lauren C.,2.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I always look for new restaurants and we love eating in Hoboken in the summertime. I've seen good reviews for Blue Eyes so we decided to give it a try. Upon walking in there were plenty of tables open outside which is where I wanted to sit. I was approached by the ""manager"" (?) and he said it would just be a few minutes until we were seated. We ended up waiting 10 minutes to sit when there were tables available & already clean. Once seated, we looked over the menu. Prior to dining here my boyfriend & I looked at the menu online as we always do and the pictures on Yelp & on Instagram. It was totally different than the menu that was in front of us. We were very disappointed because he had his heart set on the Pasta al Forno. The waitress came to take our appetizer & drink order. We ended up going with the fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini appetizer. It was decent but only came with one piece of shrimp, what were we going to do with that. Not to mention, I thought all fried calamari came with a side of sauce, this one did not. We asked the waitress for the sauce but by the time we got it we were already almost done with the appetizer. I went on and ordered the Margarita Pizza and my boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle al ragu bolognese. His food ended up coming out ten minutes before mine did. How long does it take to cook a pizza in a pizza oven??? Aren't wood burning pizza ovens supposed to cook pizza in 90 seconds? Or at least I thought so. Once I received my pizza 10 minutes later, I realized there was a puddle of oil at the top. Literally a puddle. Once I picked up my first slice all I saw was oil dripping out of it. I didn't think you could go wrong with Margarita pizza but clearly you can.On to the next dish. My boyfriend did not enjoy his pasta at all. It looked like something I could make at home, mine would probably be better actually. I had to try it, it was very bland. He only ate a couple bites and ended up eating my pizza because it was there.I was very unhappy with the service and food at this restaurant. How hard is it to remember I wanted a straw? I will definitely not be going back. It's a shame because it would be a nice restaurant right on the water. Not only did our bill come out to $60, not including tip, we had to pay $15 to park for 1.5 hours. I wouldn't mind paying for parking if we got a good meal out of it.",Blue Eyes Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Cafes,, Italian"

176,GimZBQcwm0X0ppFn8si0-w,Josh V.,3.0 star rating,"This place is quite new, open only about two weeks at the time I was there. And that newness shows, in not-great ways.The location IS great, in Sinatra park, on the water with a great view of the Hudson River and Manhattan. You can see kids playing soccer, boats on the river, joggers going by. It's pretty sweet. Parking around there isn't great (there's a public garage at 333 River, street parking while cheaper will require lots of luck).There is more seating outdoors, on three sides of the restaurant, than inside. With windows on three sides, the views inside should still be good.The food was actually quite good.Where things fell apart, and showed the newness, was in the service and execution:=I tried to determine if the lasagna was meat or vegetarian (the menu didn't say) so I asked the waiter about it, and he started to describe what lasagna WAS. To be fair, I don't believe English was his first langue=I also asked about the pasta al forno, to determine if there was meat (I like meat) and he described it, mentioning meat (or ""beef"", I forget exactly). I confirmed ""So there's meat?"" and ordered it. When it came, there was no meat. (It was still good, just not what I was wanting..also the pasta was cooked a fair bit beyond al dente.)=We had to ask for utensils and napkins when our salads arrived (after a fair amount of time)=While we ordered the same salad, one had finely chopped carrots on it, the other had no carrots=Our pasta dishes were brought out roughly two minutes after our salads...we asked them to bring them back once we had a chance to eat our salads=After paying with a credit card, the card and slips to sign were brought back without a penAny one or two of those small things would be overlooked, but all added up rather dampened the experience.

I then waited for over 10 minutes until i finally managed to make eye contact with the waiter to tell him I was ready(mind you it wasn't a busy night, maybe a total of 4,5 tables were occupied). Another 5-10 minutes went by again after the eye contact and no one came to take our order. We got up and left, as we were the parking area, the waiter came out and yelled ""sorry I was busy"". We saw at least 2 people behind the bar and what seemed to be a manager. He picked up phone calls and used the computer monitors. We were there for minimum of 25 sitting right by the bar and no one cares to bring us a menu until we asked nor take our orders.

The view is great, but the restaurant is so noisy, it is hard to appreciate it.   The food was almost inedible. I don't know how an Italian restaurant cannot even make a decent marinara sauce. During the hour-plus we waited for our food, the waitress came over three separate times to tell us they were out of something we had ordered. By the time she told us that something we had ordered a full hour earlier (and clearly should have been served a long time ago) was sold out, we were annoyed and finally complained and the management was incredibly rude. One member of our party sent his food back because it was ice cold and they still charged him for it. This place is huge rip off.   You can get great food in Hoboken.

I ate here last Friday along with my husband and another couple. we were 10 min late to our reservation time, but they say us right away. This restaurant was busy but not overwhelmingly full. We had a lovely table outside in their wrap around little seating area, overlooking the water. The location to this restaurant is definitely  prime location. Right on the water next to the water promenade. You can see the lights, the NYC buildings and everything else. The food is also excellent. We had the Calamari, which were honestly my least favorite, we also had the eggplant parm which was a HUGE portion, deff shareable. And also a pizza which the serves was nice enough to let us split it with separate toppings. Loved that:! Pizza was for two people. Really good crust and fresh topics. wine was excellent too. Their Proseco is very good and reasonably priced.  A whole bottle for 30$. I would deff come back here, especially since the service is amazing.

Pizza tasted good but was soupy. If you lifted it up all slid off. Calzone was good but in a puddle. We were doing ok and trying to salvage the meal but then it took 25 min after all was eaten for the sweetness to come out. We ordered it with our entrees. Server was handsome but not helpful or responsive. The sweetness was such a flop. Pizza crust with Nutella. There were 8 chunks of banana. 2 strawberry slivers. Just so stupid to wait for that!!! This is like a regular size pizza and like two slices had toppings??!! We won't go again. We sat down at 6:30 and begged for our check at 8 pm. At least the penne came out first and somewhat quickly.
