The cooking practices differ by a mile.I just had my first cheesesteak from Piccolos In about 10 years and they taste exactly as I remembered when I first had them. The steak was very tender, the onions were cooked to perfection, the cheese was oozing and that old world italian bread combine to make this a great sandwich. This is the makings (in my opinion) of a great Hoboken cheesesteak! I will visit Piccolos again soon. I love that in a small town like Hoboken, Hidden gems like Piccolos are available.

They make it right in front of you on the grill. It's a nice treat. Looks like a bunch of mobsters run the place. Really cool vibe. Nice lunch spot.",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks
50,hUSqqkDF6A6LiHxfGt-Euw,Jonathan S.,5.0 star rating,"I live in Philly. That said, there is absolutely no comparison between a ""Philly"" cheesesteak and Piccolo's cheesesteak.In Philadelphia, the cook takes a ""Steak-umm""-shaped very thin slice of meat and chops it into little pieces while it's defrosting on the grill. At Piccolo's, as I'm sure you've read again & again, a nice, whole ribeye is used. Steaks from either locale can satisfy, but for my money, Hoboken has it hands down over Philly!I also like the fact that, after 7 years of visiting Piccolo's at least once a month, I have never gotten even a second look from passing police at my double-parked car!My favorite cheesesteak!",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks
51,A16B6Db-70uGU6pXcb50cQ,Matt L.,1.0 star rating,"Such a huge disappointment...First lets talk about how this place is NEVER OPEN. I have heard about this place a lot after living in Hoboken for about 2 years now and how it is the ""best cheesesteak in town"". Of course, I was set on going after hearing that... But this place operates like The DMV, Open 9-5 and most likely they are closing up shop at 4:30. Now lets tall about the smell... I can only Describe the smell as rotting fish that punches you in the face as soon as you walk in the door. This is strange as they are known for cheesesteaks...The cheesesteak itself is small and just average at best. No options for condiments, lettuce or tomato. Meat was over cooked, thick and flavorless.Finally, I'll say the crowd That was in there reminds me of the crowd you would find on a Tuesday morning inside flash dancers. Weird and creepy, for those of you people who haven't been to a strip club, and it made me feel uncomfortable the entire duration of my stay.  If the Management from piccolos ever reads this, please do yourself a favor and call Gordon Ramsay ASAP.  You need the help!",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks
52,3o7n0COrrBJZIGPMnZ7hww,Tom O.,4.0 star rating,This place is as old school as it gets.  The cheesesteak is a great fried rib eye on delicious chewy Italian bread.  Pickled peppers on the table add some real heat.   Daily soup I had was good too.  Only bad thing is how long it took me to try them.,Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks
53,98-I2A0zYNR67fxyTvEu0w,Mehul P.,5.0 star rating,I work right around the corner. I tried this place for the first time a few years back. Food is amazing. The cheese-steak is not a regular cheese-steak. Its an actual piece of steak which is very good. The hot peppers on the side give it a great kick. The fries are simple but taste really good. I have tried a few of their soups and they are all pretty decent. My favorite is their pasta fagioli soup. I recently starting getting other sandwiches and they are delicious. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The owner is also a very nice guy and takes care of his customers. This is one place I will definitely continue going to.,Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks

Let it be known that the cheesesteak is as good as they say it is. Simple and straightforward: one terrific, perfectly cooked piece of steak resting nicely on a grilled roll with a slice of cheese. I added onions and took my sister's tip to add hot pepper and ketchup. Fold it up and enjoy; the  flavors meld together gloriously and bonus points go to it being not at all messy. I couldn't stop raving about it during and after eating it. It's not huge but I found the portion size appropriately satisfying.",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks

You will be left with a sandwich that puts to shame most cheesesteaks, or steak sandwiches, or whatever category you think this falls in.  Two things make this simple sandwich incredible: fresh bread, grilled with a slight char...and fresh cut, rib eye steak.  Hands down the best I have had....love the old school atmosphere too.  Who doesn't love Sinatra?!",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks

If you like Rutt's Hut type deep-fried dogs, that's how they do them here too.  Bring cash and get here before 4pm, they close early.  Only reason not 5 stars is that they are getting fairly pricey, lunch for two will be 30 bucks if you're not careful.",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks

S&P.  Throw in the onions and cheese and you've got a winner.  After taking one bite, I ordered two more to go.  Table space is limited but you can belly up to the counter.  This is worth the wait.",Piccolo’s,4.0 star rating,$,Cheesesteaks
