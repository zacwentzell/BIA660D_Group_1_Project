0,FLsECwL1OxZuwxPS7yQsgg,Sean I.,5.0 star rating,"Lived in Hoboken and ate at every Chinese food shop in town - this is hands down the best. Used to order from Precious and always disappointed. Their Won Ton is very good (wish it had pork bits and some more green veggies in the broth), but the wonton are firm and delicious. Big fan of beef and broccoli, the broccoli are cooked through and not too crisp (this is the way I like it). Also pork fried rice is excellent too - pro tip, combine pork fried rice with beef and broccoli. Also crazy fast delivery for Hoboken.  Literally took 20 minutes with my last order (I didn't use Yelp - I just called). The place looks like a hole in the wall, but their food is literally the best Chinese in Hoboken.",Number 1 Chinese Kitchen,3.0 star rating,$,Chinese

I only allow myself to indulge in the lunch special once a week least my belt tighten too much, but you get excellent portion sizes, prepared to order, and the staff is exceptionally friendly and kind.
