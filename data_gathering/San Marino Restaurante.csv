Yes, you are probably thinking this review is overdue since I visited there in October and you are correct-lol. However, it is important for me to mention this nice eatery especially since this is an Italian Restaurant and you know how much I love Italian Food-lol. San Marino Restaurant is conveniently located next door to a Sheraton Hotel.There was nice outdoor and Indoor decor. My first observations were the Halloween themed carved pumpkins as well as garland and lights surrounding the entryway into the place. Lovely front patio furniture where one can enjoy eating outside. Gorgeous ambiance inside added to my great dining experience as they have leather furniture, tables arrangements, flowers, artwork, chandeliers, lighting arrangements etc. I sat by their flat screen tv and felt so comfortable.I started my meal with Cranberry/Orange Juice which was mixed well. Deciding to check in on Yelp led me to receive their free Fried Zucchini appetizer.  The Fochaka Bread had olives and parmesan cheese in it and tasted heavenly! Spaghetti Bolognese was the entree I chose which was incredible...Staff Mario and Enzo are delightful! Both of them tended to patrons, brought whatever was needed to the table, answered questions and were professional yet extremely friendly. Mario kept me laughing...his kindness and fabulous customer service are more than enough reason to visit  San Marino Restaurant!Oh and another reason is definitely to try the good Fochaka Bread and Entrees!",San Marino Restaurante,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Desserts,, Salad"

Located right next to the Sheraton hotel near West Houston Street, this Italian spot is a favorite among the locals.They have a nice selection of classic pasta dishes along with meats and seafood entrees. They also have a TV up above, tonight it was tuned onto CNN and I once again watched the living nightmare that is Donald Trump's Presidency. Anyway, lets not ruin my review and return to the great food!I was offered the complimentary bread basket which was fresh and hot right out of the oven. I didn't eat that right away though, I waited until my pasta came out so I could dip it in the wonderful sauce. For my pasta I went with something simple and classic, Spaghetti Carbonara. It was soo rich and decadent, the cream sauce sooo good with fresh egg yolk and cream all emulsifying together. It was also too filling that I couldn't finish it all, so I asked to have it wrapped up so I could take it home.I also had the Baked Clams as an appetizer. Very aromatic and the bread crumbs added a nice crunch.Normally, I would order something classic like Tiramisu or Panna Cotta, but since I was too full from the Carbonara, I knew I couldn't have anything like that tonight. I instead opted for the Vanilla gelato since I knew that would go down easy and wouldn't overtax my intestines LOL.I once again also had a warm, frothy cup of Cappuccino as I always do when I dine somewhere Italian.",San Marino Restaurante,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Desserts,, Salad"

To top that off, Sammy, the owner, and Mario, came by to wish the birthday boy happy birthday with a scrumptious piece of chocolate cake which was oozing with strawberry syrup, dressed with a single lit candle.

San Marino came to me from Yelp heaven and I couldn't have been more happy with reserving a bridal shower here. With no minimum required and no extra charge for bringing a dessert, this place was truly perfect for our budget.This restaurant is connected with the Four Points Sheraton hotel.  We were able to reserve a space in its main dining area with a sun window on top and doors all around to allow for a private event. The space was perfect, plenty of space to set up a presents section and even set up a projector for a slide show. The service and management were spectacular. They were so accommodating for all my requests of time, requesting for a projector screen and allowing for an extra person when someone came last minute. We were allowed to decorate the space, giving us 45 minutes before the reservation to set up and the table was already set up communal style  by the staff when we arrived which saved us a lot of time. Service of the food was very timely, we never felt rushed to leave.As for the food, it was spectacular for what we paid for. At $30 a head, we received multiple plates of appetizers served family style as well a main entrée served individually. A prix fix menu was prepped on all our plates upon arrival as well which was greatly appreciated. For appetizers, they offered multiple big plates of antipasti including olives and eggplant chips, delicious crunchy calamari, capresse salad, Caesar salad, and bread. For main entrée, they offered a choice of salmon, chicken and mushroom ravioli. It also came with sides of broccoli and French fries. Everything was large in portion and we were all so thoroughly full by the end of the bridal shower. It really was spectacular service.

12,jiMwksIaLr3DvEhbdG69Bg,Joseph T.,4.0 star rating,"This was a great little stop for a Lobby restaurant. It has its separate entrance outside as well walking through a small open courtyard right next to the Four Points Lobby in SoHo on Charlton. You walk into a bar area that is very very tiny with about six seats at the bar. It is a very bright room with little if any character. I walked in & the bartender was not very friendly or attentive. She was a younger girl with three customers at her bar and seemed quite overwhelmed and completely not interested that a customer walked in the door. I walked past her and towards the back of the restaurant which is where the other two rooms are located. You walk into the next one which again is quite bright but darker appointments were in the room and where the service station is. I was greeted immediately by several male servers who were very very attentive and friendly. I decided to sit in the back room which is where all the character is. The tables in that room are linen-covered and candle-lit. the lighting was subdued and quite nice. The mudic playing was very indicative of the Sinatra era. The room was darker in styling and very italianate. It has a glass ceiling with a large Center chandelier so that was pretty interesting. When it came time to order, the food was VERY good. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. They definitely lean towards a little more fine dining but nothing over the top and I would describe the atmosphere as upscale casual. I had some tortellini in brodo and it was very well prepared and extremely tasty. Followed by a fish oriented dinner of red snapper & jumbo shrimp sauteed wonderfully in a lemon wine sauce with a small side of spaghetti. It was very flavorful and well presented. A variety of breads came out during the meal as well as separate complimentary dishes of assorted olives and sauteed zicchini to enjoy. There is a bar and open wine list which is also quite inexpensive and you can definitely find what you're looking for. Pricing was very reasonable and the atmosphere was okay so I'd say this is a great spot to just pop in if you're wandering around Soho and looking for something Italian.

49,42vrkIXMb2wtr7Ug08mcWA,Tiffany D.,1.0 star rating,"Went to this place out of last minute desperation. I called the Four Points by Sheraton first and was transferred to the restaurant when I asked for help with a private room. I guess the reservations for meeting space go through the restaurant... weird but okay I was in need. Nice enough to start and price was reasonable. They asked me to fill out a CC form to charge a $100 deposit and then to use when we were done. My CEO is leaving the meeting room at the end of the day thinking his EA took care of it and the Manager rudely demands he pay and give him a credit card. My CEO responds with ""I thought this was taken care of?"" He says something like, ""Nothing was taken care of, I set up the perfect room for you and you didn't even pay"" as if we were trying to steal something from him and by the way, the room sucked. I call the guy while my CEO is standing in front of him and he screams at me about how I never followed through with his bookkeeper to send the form (news flash, I sent the CC form directly to him and got an email response confirming back but I guess he is too old to remember yesterday). He then says ""If you sent me something, I didn't get it and I didn't charge you so give me the credit card NOW!"" Great, so I can just send my credit card information out and it just goes to nowhere land... My CEO then says, ""you know, here is my card, just charge it and call it a day."" Unfortunately, the guy continues to having a shouting match with my CEO. Luckily, I have an awesome CEO that has a very kind and has a positive attitude and he just let it roll off his back but I am not so forgiving. I would give you zero stars if I could. I can't believe Sheraton would send anyone to this guy.

It was early on Saturday (5:30 or so) so they were able to accommodate our group of 8.  We were served complimentary plates of olives and delightful zucchini chips. Baskets of bread came out and I could have made a meal out of the olive bread.  I had the farfalle with salmon, my husband had the chicken parmigiana and my friend to the other side of me had the ravioli. Lots of trying foods from other plates and not one of us was the least bit unhappy with anything. I'm always impressed with perfectly al dente pasta. The service was outstanding and Mario was more like a friend and part of our group by the end of the meal. The complimentary snifter of ""grappa"" (maybe mixed with sambuca or frangelico?) was the perfect ending.

51,hXAD-TPANMvjWi7F0cd9QA,Michelle T.,4.0 star rating,"We had a reservation here for 7:30 for a party of 12 on Christmas Eve and they gave us the nice little private room in the back. It was extremely comfortable and we all felt like we had our own little area to chat, drink and catch up. Our waiters were extremely attentive but they did push the wine list a bit too hard. We ended up opening a bottle of wine for the table to share though. We ordered 6 appetizers for the table to share and it was barely just enough. The appetizer sizes are a bit small so 3 dishes for 5-6 people on each side of the long table wasn't really enough. Tip: Order at least 4-5 appetizers if you don't plan on loading up on the bread. The entree sizes though are just about right. We were all very full after our entrees, but part of it was because we polished off two bread baskets! I had one of the specials of the day, which was the Lobster Ravioli. There were huge chunks of lobsters inside the ravioli! The pink sauce it came with was so delicious that I had to ask for more bread to dip the sauce in. So so so good! The Boyfriend's squid ink pasta was also very good - the pasta was bouncy and the salmon chunks that came with it was cooked perfectly. We opted for a dessert to share and we had the creme brulee. I don't think it was quite creamy enough. It wasn't the worst creme brulee that I've ever had but it wasn't the best either.

I had to remove stars for the ""service charge"" that seems to just prey on innocent diners and tourists. Layout/Ambience: There are two parts to the San Marino; the bar/outdoor lounge area and the dining room in the back. The dining area has private booths, but mostly ables with white tablecloths, napkins, etc. While the dress code is listed as ""casual"", it is NYC so mostly suits/blouses/dresses. Not expensive evening wear, but not a jeans and tee kind of place. Most dishes range from $13-20 on the menu, but specials can be more in the $20-$40 range. Food/Service: Service was good, my glass never fell below the halfway mark, spilled crumbs (oops!) were dealt with crisply, and staff seemed to know when to pop in. There were so many daily specials it took at least 3 full minutes I'm sure. I had the special broiled Mediterranean sea bass with garlic, rosemary, lemon, and a side of broccoli. Wow, I must say they really know how to use garlic correctly! The fish was so perfectly cooked, crispy outside and juicy inside. I will definitely remember that fish for years. My company ordered the lobster ravioli (excellent) and grilled pork sausage with beans (much too salty for my taste). For dessert we had the house-made tiramisu, which was excellent, more like traditional tiramisu. CAUTION: On our bill there was an 18% ""service charge"". I asked around and apparently they do that for tourists and such. We paid a 15% tip on top of the service charge. So our total was about $60 more than our subtotal.

95,UtHV5ixDhtLTBygNtnEfKw,David H.,1.0 star rating,"Whatever we do for money, we cannot hope to make it in New York if we are merely average.  Even subway car dancers cannot expect me to open my wallet merely by disturbing my commute, yelling ""It's Showtime"" and then proceeding to nearly kick me in the face landing a backflip or contorting their bodies around a subway pole during a rachet version of a Cirque du Soleil acrobatic routine without at LEAST being as good as their other boombox wielding competitors. Which is why in a city with an overabundance of Italian restaurants, I have no idea how San Marino is in business.  I ate here last week for an alumni dinner and the food was horrible.  Among the passed hors d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour were narrowly sliced slices of regular pizza and chicken wings which are unwieldy in a setting in which one is standing around with a drink in one hand and regularly shaking hands with the other.  These offerings should be bite sized and should not require two hands to consume, which both the pizza and wings did.The service was also unbelievably slow.  After a soggy Caesar salad, my entree did not come out for nearly an hour.  I ordered the salmon which was not only tiny but also overcooked when it should have been prepared medium as indicated on the menu.  I also tried the snapper that someone at my table ordered and although one does not order that fish medium, it too was overcooked.  The cherry tomatoes that accompanied the snapper tasted old.    I guess since this restaurant is part of a hotel and exists largely for the convenience of its guests, it does not have the same pressure that stand alone restaurants in the City have to attract enough customers to make rent.  Good for them.  Bad for the rest of us.",San Marino Restaurante,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Desserts,, Salad"

When we arrived, we were seated quickly by the owner himself. He was as sincere and attentive as I thought he might be. The environment is very pleasant; ambient light, unobtrusive music, nice buzz but you can have a conversation. Service was excellent. Food was superb. Delicious arugula salad was tasty and lightly dressed (not drowned in a cup of dressing off the Sysco truck). We both ate fish, and both were beautifully prepared and nice sized portions. They have a nice little wine list and we finished the meal with a tasty little limoncello which was brought to us on the house. Delightful.Lastly, to eat salads, fresh fish and wine in NYC and get a bill for 88 bucks is downright amazing.

It's a white-napkin restaurant buried in a medium-grade hotel, and we were the only table in there. The grim, somber waitstaff seemed surprised that they had customers. They acted stubborn about serving still water vs. sparkling water - for some reason they tried to steer us away from sparkling. We entertained ourselves with a story about how this was an Olive Garden that we had stumbled upon off an interstate exit during the 25 minute wait for our food. When it came out we quickly realized that the minestrone was basic Campbell's canned, and my pasta bolognese was Spagettio's with ham scraps. One of my clients raved about his nostalgia upon biting into the Kraft Single on his turkey club. When another group entered the restaurant toward the end of the meal we were in disbelief.

These were generous portions of very juicy white meat strips, lightly breaded and with excellent, flavorful sauces, cooked to order and served piping hot. The julienne veggies were perfectly half-crisp and delicious. The pan-roasted rosemary potatoes were among the best I've had, with fresh rosemary crisped just right in olive oil.

He went to speak to the owner, and the owner himself returned to say he would honor the ad and we could order any appetizer and main course we wished for a discounted price - even the special, which was lobster ravioli (excellent).It was a lovely place -  warm , relaxed and atmospheric, belying its location that gave the impression it was part of a hotel. (they apparently lease the space from the hotel but it operates as an independent restaurant) The service was exceptional, we were happy with our food (loved my sauteed artichoke heart and mushroom appetizer and the Caesar salad was excellent too) and the charming Italian owner came over to make sure we were enjoying our meal.We had ordered iced teas and midway through the dinner the waiter swept away our old glasses and gave us fresh ice teas in lieu of refilling our glasses, which they didn't even charge for.We received our bill and noticed that they neglected to charge us for the tiramisu we ordered for dessert (it was fabulous, by the way), so we called over the owner and mentioned it  and he graciously said it was on the house.I think it is this kind of service, ""special dinner' notwithstanding that will bring us back here.  We noticed that the owner approached many tables to speak to them and make sure they were enjoying themselves.

113,Lv2rhzFq2iRyTFwDPssP4Q,Sara M.,1.0 star rating,"Saw their advertised Valentine's Pre Fixe menu for $40 a person and decided to book a table for 2. I was a little upset to arrive and see it was inside a Sheraton hotel. I would never stay in a Sheraton hotel, so dining inside one isn't high on my priority list. Strike 1! My date and I were 40 mins late for our reservation and they still accepted us. We were led immediately back to a table next to a refrigerator stocked with sodas. I thought ok, I guess we deserve a crappy table for being late, so no biggie. Then it went down hill fast. We sit for about 5 mins and are served less than quarter of a champagne glass with yummy bubbly and 2 strawberries. This was the highlight of my experience at San Marino, so a full glass would have been better. Strike 2!  My date and I chit chat for a good while then notice we have nothing to talk about, which is rare. I notice that we had been sitting there for 30 minutes and no one had taken our order. I mention to a passing waiter that we are ready. He comes back in 10 minutes to take our order. 40 mins to take my order?!? For real? I should've gotten up and left at this point, but I was still hopeful. Strike 3!While the minutes pass and no food comes we are momentarily distracted by the rude table behind us that turned on a wall tv to some sports channel. Instantly the mood transformed to sports bar, which was nauseating. Apparently, this table was complaining about not receiving their entrees and I guess they were trying to pass the time, but it just wasn't appropriate. Not one employee came over to say anything or turn off the tv. Thankfully, a neighboring diner (or person waiting to be served in this case) asked for them to turn off the tv. Strike 4! Too many at this point, but it get's worse.About 30 more minutes go by and still no food. No salads or anything. I think they brought more bread, but salads don't take over an hour to make. These are easily premade. I'm so confused! Something is definitely wrong here. The table next to us is so annoyed, they say they can't wait anymore. In the meantime the annoying table behind us get's a bill for their 1st course and also prepares to leave. The table next to us leaves a $5 tip and walks out. We wait another 5 mins and finally choose to leave as well when we notice an hour and a half had gone by and all we had to eat was bread and butter. We don't leave a tip or anything, but this was my VDay and San Marino ruined it. They could've at least been apologetic or communicate any complications they were having, but they didn't. On the way out my date was kind of rude and was telling the 6 people waiting to be seated to not waste their time and leave now. That may have been out of line, but I wish someone had warned us on the way in to save us that hour and a half of our lives.Fortunately I called last minute and found another soho Italian spot to have dinner. 10 mins later we sat down at Mezzagiorno and were asked immediately what we wanted to eat. Within 10 mins our 1st course was out....Ahhhhh service at last! We were fed and out of there in an hour. Sadly, we get accustomed to great service here in NYC and don't give credit where credit is due, but boy does bad service stick out like a sore thumb and leave a bad taste in your mouth.
