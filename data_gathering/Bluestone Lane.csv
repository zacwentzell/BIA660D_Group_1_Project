2,wU62o5mwLK14jtk0eRRvqg,Tom B.,5.0 star rating,"My favourite Bluestone location, and a weekend staple of mine! There really isn't anything that compares to a good Aussie coffee. The magic is always strong, a perfect way to kick off the weekend's activities. I've worked my way through the menu, having tried around three quarters of what they have to offer. Depending on your level of hunger, and inclination to eat healthy, there's plenty to choose from. My go to options are the avocado toast with a poached egg, the granola with unreal lemon curd and berries, and the breakfast bowl which is bursting full of fresh goodness. If your first brunch course leaves you wanting a little more, the almond butter and raspberry jam toast is the perfect little dessert to finish off with. On another note, my girlfriend basically lives for the salmon, cream cheese toast with a side of the heirloom tomatoes. For any fish-lovers, this is definitely a great option. If you're heading down on the weekend (especially when the weather is good), make sure you stop by in the late morning, rather than the afternoon since it gets extremely busy!",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

17,riCUEy3tljyX0vnEG4BxPg,Maria C.,1.0 star rating,"Do not come here. I am not a hard patron to please and very rarely award a place such a low rating but even I can say that this place needs a lot of help. My friend and I walked in and there's a small sign that says to wait to be seated but there's no hostess stand of any sort so everyone just crowds in the doorway. The one woman working that day was working as host and server. She walked right past us and at least 5 other people also waiting maybe four times before even acknowledging that we were there. Now, the place was full and she was the only person working the front of the house but still - at least say hey I will be with you in a minute rather than walking right past us and saying nothing. We were sat 5-10 minutes after arriving which is understandable. But what wasn't was the fact that it took almost an entire hour to get TWO AVOCADO TOASTS. I wish I was kidding. The seating is communal style benches which is cute and fun but we could hear the three ladies right next to us becoming clearly upset at how ridiculously long their food was also taking. They addressed it with the one and only person working the front of the house (the hostess/server mentioned earlier) and she seemed to just blow it off, at one point even saying something to the effect of ""oh, no hold on I don't handle complaints. That's what the manager is for,"" and literally walked away from the conversation. I couldn't believe it. These three ladies next to my friend and I all also ordered avocado toast. This extraordinarily long wait would be understandable if you'd ordered something extraordinarily extravagant and time consuming. But we didn't - literally just avocado toast. Because the women next to us complained about the wait, the server brought them a piece of banana bread. I am ALL for service recovery but her delivery of the bread and the size and quantity of the bread was sad. To bring one piece for 3 people and then to just pretty much set it down and walk away didn't really do much in the way of service recovery if you ask me. The other thing that bothered me about this was that my friend and I had been waiting almost exactly as long as these 3 ladies next to us and were not offered banana bread or other form of compensation for waiting 1 whole hour for a piece of toast. Ordinarily I would not expect that the server compensate every diner in the same way but when the tables are communal style benches, it makes it sort of awkward when the people you are literally brushing shoulders with are offered something and you are not. There was no compensation whatsoever or no acknowledgement from any sort of manager. We were sitting right next to the kitchen area where they prepare the drinks and assemble the toasts, and could hear all the chaos going on in there as well - not a single person seemed to be on the same page. As for when the toast finally did come, the avocado spread was good but the toast itself was not. It seemed stale and overly toasted and didn't at all make up for the hour long wait for it. Had I been in any sort of hurry, we would have never waited around that long. Not sure if I just caught this place on a really off day or what but I would never go back.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Like all Bluestone locations that I've been to, this spot has an upscale beachy vibe with bright and clean space. This is such a refreshing addition to Hoboken, albeit slightly disorganized when they first opened. They didn't provide waiter service then and pick-up counter didn't run smoothly. But I've been back here and the service has improved & been nothing short of commendable. I see they've taken constructive criticisms well. :-) Staff is super friendly and the managers are accommodating. No wifi, but you'll get over it. Geotag doesn't exist (only accessible by the business owner) but you'll get over it.Avocado toast is solid, as expected. Salmon toast is served with a generous portion of fresh salmon with cream cheese on a multigrain bread, garnished with dill (so dill-icious)!  Plating and food presentation deserve an applause! Excellent selection of beverages, especially the wellness drinks. Also, you can never go wrong with the Flat White. Ever. I must say, they are on top of their game!

To bring one piece for 3 people and then to just pretty much set it down and walk away didn't really do much in the way of service recovery if you ask me. The other thing that bothered me about this was that my friend and I had been waiting almost exactly as long as these 3 ladies next to us and were not offered banana bread or other form of compensation for waiting 1 whole hour for a piece of toast. Ordinarily I would not expect that the server compensate every diner in the same way but when the tables are communal style benches, it makes it sort of awkward when the people you are literally brushing shoulders with are offered something and you are not. There was no compensation whatsoever or no acknowledgement from any sort of manager. We were sitting right next to the kitchen area where they prepare the drinks and assemble the toasts, and could hear all the chaos going on in there as well - not a single person seemed to be on the same page. As for when the toast finally did come, the avocado spread was good but the toast itself was not. It seemed stale and overly toasted and didn't at all make up for the hour long wait for it. Had I been in any sort of hurry, we would have never waited around that long. Not sure if I just caught this place on a really off day or what but I would never go back.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Like all Bluestone locations that I've been to, this spot has an upscale beachy vibe with bright and clean space. This is such a refreshing addition to Hoboken, albeit slightly disorganized when they first opened. They didn't provide waiter service then and pick-up counter didn't run smoothly. But I've been back here and the service has improved & been nothing short of commendable. I see they've taken constructive criticisms well. :-) Staff is super friendly and the managers are accommodating. No wifi, but you'll get over it. Geotag doesn't exist (only accessible by the business owner) but you'll get over it.Avocado toast is solid, as expected. Salmon toast is served with a generous portion of fresh salmon with cream cheese on a multigrain bread, garnished with dill (so dill-icious)!  Plating and food presentation deserve an applause! Excellent selection of beverages, especially the wellness drinks. Also, you can never go wrong with the Flat White. Ever. I must say, they are on top of their game! This location, however, has limited brunch menu selection. They do need to expand their menu. Seasonal menu is always a great option.Bring forth the Brekkie board.

39,Jfn08iBR3uZnFx1rqz0qTQ,Melissa W.,2.0 star rating,"Bluestone Lane did an excellent job building hype for their Hoboken location.  I've been following them on Instagram and patiently waiting for their opening.  It's a gorgeous Easter Sunday and everyone is out and about.  It's the perfect time to visit Bluestone Lane.The café is very, very cute but execution is poor and frustrating.The layout - the menu is only located on the back wall so while you're waiting on line its hard to know what the options are.  What was similarly frustrating is the lack of garbage receptacles.  They are located only at the counter of milk.  This is used by the baristas as well as guests, and if you are eating-in, you have to squeeze through the crowds back at the counter to throw out your trash.  The music was super loud by the register as well so you could barely hear yourself think.  Lastly, the flow is just off.  You wait in line to pay at the back of the store.  Then you have to fight through the crowd to wait for your order, which comes out near the back of the line.  It's just a mess.The prices - They had promoted a BOGO deal on social media.  At the counter, she tells me I need a flyer in order to redeem the deal, and there may or may not be some at the front of the café.  Okay...so we forgo the deal.  It's also confusing that their menu only has one price, but the cashier encourage you to get a large which is more costly; the prices should be clearer on the menu so you aren't caught flat-footed at the register.  That leads to the next point, the drinks are pricey.  For the cost of our two drinks ($11+ for a large cold brew and a large aussie iced latte), we could have had two trenta frappucinos at Starbucks.The drinks - The cold brew was average.  When it came out, there was an inch of room on the top of the cup so we had to ask them to top it off.  We had our hopes up for the aussie iced latte but it was 90% milk, a little espresso, and a scoop of ice cream.  If you like drinking cold milk, get this.Love our local shops but won't be back here for a while.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I was surprised reading their menu to find a Long Black (similar to an americano) and a Golden Latte (their own creation).  With my interest peaked they gave me the rundown on their Golden Latte which include cayenne, cinnamon, turmeric, and coconut sugar (which is low on the glycemic index).  Well this was right up my ally especially with the almond milk.  Not only was this Latte creamy it was Golden AND of course delicious!  I was super impressed with putting the time doc in coffee especially with the health benefits You can check out my pictures.  So far they get an A+ for service, atmosphere, and creativity.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

After about 5 minutes of standing at the ""Please wait to be seated"" sign I decided to walk up to the counter and order a coffee. After paying, I asked if it was alright to grab a seat. I was told I'd have to switch out my to-go cup for a ceramic mug (seems like a waste but whatever). I go to sit down at a table not wanting to take up any space, when all of a sudden a waiter walks up and tells me it's table service only. Anyways he points me over to the side bar where I was happy to reside, except the manager had occupied a few seats doing work and his napkins occupied the other stools.After taking a seat at a middle table I realized that there was no wifi, which makes it hard to handle work and/or study, so I took off, with what was now a cold cup of Aussie coffee (back in paper w/no lid) and a bad taste in my mouth.Likely won't be back to the Hoboken one anytime soon, which is a shame because I enjoy the Carmine St location.

The 'flat white' coffee is similar but deeper in aroma and flavor and tastes more caffeinated per rich, creamy sip. The salmon toast was a work of perfection: the salmon was medium thickness, outstanding in quality, and plentiful. It was placed atop the almost equal thickness fresh Balthazar bread (which was a hearty and a good 3/4 inch thick slice), like wavelets of sea upon sand. For the first time in my life, the ratio seemed correct as the salmon was not only delicious in quality but so much of it; no skimping here. The fresh dill and the thin layer of cream cheese which tasted homemade, soft and fresh, with a medium richness and slight tartness balanced the entire dish.  The salmon toast can easily become addictive.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

My experience there has always been great. After waiting a while to place our orders for coffee, avacado toast and breakfast bowl, we had to wait even longer to get it. My avacado toast came out with completely overcooked poached egg, so did the egg in the breakfast bowl. After offering to remake the order of an avacado toast the waitress left and never came back. Waited over 30 min without anyone checking. Eventually, we had to ask someone inside to take the food off our bill and leave to go eat somewhere else. Hoping this was a one time experience at this location.",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
85,eWIrXjGX1S4IGaNVhQpqqg,Zuma B.,2.0 star rating,Coffee is good but everything is over priced. I ordered 2 eggs on gluten free toast and small coffee - $15. But they couldn't get the bread to toast. Tried 3 different toasters and none worked. So essentially 2 poached (which were also cold because they made the eggs before the struggle with the toast) for $15. I probably could have brunch somewhere for not much more than this. And they don't take cash?? To me that is ridiculous especially if you're only getting a cup of coffee.,Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
86,RI4CRwLoyE_ujiSv2v-aXw,Katie R.,5.0 star rating,"Really great upgraded coffee shop with lots of healthy and innovative options!  I love their toasts and have tried a lot of them: ab&j; avocado + the lot; banana with honey & cinnamon; salmon toast.  I've also tried their iced lattes, iced chai, and the iced milo. YUM! Be prepared to wait a bit, as it DOES get pretty crazy in there, especially on the weekends.  Much better to plan to sit than to take out.  But the staff is kind and accommodating and it's a nice addition to Washington Street and rises far above the ""commercial"" coffee spots on Washington Street like Starbucks, Panera, or Dunkin.  I'm definitely a repeat customer!",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

94,6zScC-7E1hO5ik9Ce5HNDQ,Tiffany T.,2.0 star rating,"The issue I have with this store isn't with the personality of the wait staff or barista (which i thought were doing their best and had great personality) or the quality of their products but the service that is provided by this coffee shop. I have gone to this store a little more than half a dozen times over the last two months just to try it out and see if there are improvements(as it is a new store) but each time I go I am just so disappointed by the turnout of events. **Just for reference, I only go for their take out service not their sit-down/dine-in service.** Anyways, every time I go I end up waiting at least 8-10 minutes for 1 beverage order. Today was my limit, I waited 10 minutes before I turned to wait staff and asked them to check on my aussie iced latte. She told me she would go check to see was going on and as she left I watched her go into the back room and later bring out the cup with the scoop of ice cream and hand it off to the barista--so basically my order wasn't even on the list of coffee to be made. This wasn't an issue with the barista but the process that this Blue Stone uses to serve their customers. I saw this happen to the two couples in front of me who waited what seems to be 15-20 minutes for their coffee and their toast. All the people who had been waiting for takeout had been waiting at least as long as I had and more. This coffee shop was churning out coffee for their sit down customers before even touching the takeout ones. And basically everyone in take out was asking the waitstaff where their orders were, not because they were being fussy or impatient but because waiting 10-15+ minutes for a single order is kinda ridiculous. I've been to coffee shops all over hoboken (bwe, starbucks, DD, empire, bean vault, choco-o-pain) franchisees and cafe style and have never experienced this kind of pain to get my coffee in the morning. In my experience normally people who are getting take out are in more of a rush that people who are sitting down for a meal~ but that's just my opinion. I don't have enough time int the morning to sit down at this place and I surely can't be waiting 10+ minutes for takeout coffee. I'm overall constantly disappointed in this place and would ""maybe"" recommend their sit down but i can't say for sure that they get better service except from what I can observe. If I wanted to wait 10+ minutes to get service I would sit down and have a meal. I think what they can improve on is how they process their take out orders- maybe have a separate barista or staff make the food and meals. Also maybe if they see their customers standing around for 10+ minutes ask them if they're still waiting on something (I'm not just standing there as a spectator).Final remarks: This isn't a bwe or a choco-o-pain or a starbucks....at best it's just a cafe that serves food and coffee that also has an option to get take out but def. only offers the functionality of a cafe and not a coffee shop. Don't come here in the morning if you want to be served in a timely manner (I've tried that about 7 times and it's not worth it)",Bluestone Lane,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Gluten-Free,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
