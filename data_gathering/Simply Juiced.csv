4,zMilz6OlDmRAxiReuMGgBg,Gina R.,5.0 star rating,"Hands down best premium smoothie/juice place in Hoboken. And Jersey City for that matter.Let's start with the smoothies.  The ingredients are premium and include fresh young Thai coconut water (and frozen coconut meat!), raw honey, fresh mint, Brazil nut butter, hemp milk, black mission figs and, of course, kale.  You can order one of the 10 on the menu or create your own.  I recommend the Bubblegum - it's very lightly sweetened with honey only (you can customize the level). It is unbelievably good, strawberry, pineapple, pomegranate, coconut water, plus acai and goji berries.  You can't go wrong and will love anything you order.Next up: juices.  So all the juices are made in house.  One case is 100% organic.  There are about 20 varieties of green juices.   Orange juice.  Simple pure carrot juice, pineapple, even pear!  Chia seed drinks.  Spoiler alert: charcoal lemonade.  Aloe water.  There's ginger and wheatgrass shots.  And my favorite - creama de coco.  This baby is blended coconut meat and water, creating a smooth creamy masterpiece.  It's a vacation to the tropics in a bottle.Another case is dedicated to raw and vegan food.  Find veggie burgers, raw-o-licious (gf raw oats, coconut, dates), chia pudding, burritos, raw tarts, some salads like the Cuban ceviche.  All of it is thoughtfully crafted and very fresh.Pricing - ranges from $5-10.  Offering a cleanse package for $58 with 7 juices.  It's a really good deal!There's steady food traffic here.  There's something for everyone, even kids.  It's easy to understand why - the owner and his staff are super friendly and knowledgeable.  There's some samples on hand and they are happy to help you find exactly what kind of juice you are craving.  Happy smoothie-ing!",Simply Juiced,4.5 star rating,$$,"Vegan,, Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Live/Raw, Food"

I wish I could give Simply Juiced 6 stars. I was a vegan for almost 20 years, I have travelled all over the west coast and used to live in San Francisco so I know a thing or two about vegan restaurants. Trust me when I say that Simply Juiced is the best of the best. Every single item I tried was flawless. Creative, delicious, nourishing, prepared with love and simply incredible. It made me wish I had two stomachs. Often vegan food falls into the trap of assuming that just because of the veganism it is automatically healthy. This is not true at all. Eat too much processed fake meat and fake cheese and you will ruin your biome. Simply Juiced does not fall into this trap. Another trap is assuming that food that is healthy is automatically delicious. This is not true at all. Fresh organic ingredients are essential, but they must also be prepared with creativity and flavor or it's just a bunch of ingredients in a pile. Simply Juiced does not fall into this trap either. Simply Juiced is absolutely incredible. I will be ordering from them every week I am in town. They are such a cut above the competition that it's not even fair to place them in the same category. Simply Juiced deserves a Michelin Star, and not even some upcycled local vegan version of a Michelin Star, in talking about the real deal here. Simply Juiced takes big fat healthy well digested probiotic sh*ts all over the competition and then starts its day kicking *ss and taking names.
