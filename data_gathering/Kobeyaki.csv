1,m6sw8ZqYewPVtH6uFiuIgQ,Jenny C.,1.0 star rating,"#1 complaint: the side entrance should be blocked. It is extremely disruptive to have someone enter or exit from there, causing freezing gusts of wind to sweep all the napkins onto the floor. Food was meh, nothing special. The Udon Noodle Soup was served in a plastic bowl. Who knows if the plastic melts into the soup or not. Taste wise, it was the typical sweet udon flavored soup. Two tempura shrimp was decently fried. The kobeyaki burger was more like cole slaw on slab of patty. Very mediocre. Not in any way worthy of its $tag.I also got the bowl with beef and half brown rice and half salad. Wayyy too much teriyaki sauce. It was hard to stomach so much sweetness in one meal. Only saving factor was the self pump wasabi sauce. That managed to help everything go down.",Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"

I want to try everything and have been waiting for this place to open up, since I work nearby. I think today is the first day - and I'm glad it's here :)",Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
3,DoAvJEpYGEqAiGp5HM23aQ,MrFoodFood L.,3.0 star rating,I had the tuna sushi.  It was pretty. It was slightly disappointing because the rice was slightly under cooked.  For $10 I can only give it..3 star.,Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
4,DV5zc_IwU5jCKvq46ZqPzA,Pamela Q.,4.0 star rating,"I've been waiting for this place to open and  so far so good.  It did not disappoint!  First time I had the Teriyaki shrimp bowl.  Very tasty but after a while I needed water due to the sodium.  I would have it again.  Big portion too!  Next time I had the salmon volvano roll...hefty roll,  the salmon is cooked and its spicy and good.  Glad they opened this spot for a different lunch option.  Ill be visiting again.",Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
5,-DyBwBRGhSK50_eh0zm98A,Agnes S.,4.0 star rating,Very good quick Japanese food for lunch. Elevated fast food. Can't wait to go back and try more items from the menu. Portions seem a tad small though. Got the tuna tataki salad and my friend the grilled vegetable bowl. Both were very good. And as another reviewer mentioned the dipping sauces were very tasty.,Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
6,kGOoQCNYNmKNYZbgadB5Lg,Edward V.,3.0 star rating,"0 for 1. More grumbling than praise from coworkers who have been here, but I gave them a shot. Looked at the menu and decided the wagyu burger was going to be the definitive representation for this place. Just got that and a miso soup which banged the wallet hard. The burger came out dry and overloaded with coleslaw to make it look ""thick""...but the patty didn't seem much larger than a normal Whopper. The bun was over toasted and hard like it sat under a warmer too long. For the price...meh, prob not going back.",Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
7,t6RvU4hNT6i2RojEQN6oNg,Tochi D.,3.0 star rating,"I was excited to see a new lunch spot near my job, unfortunately the food was a bit disappointing. I got the bowl with udon noodles and beef teriyaki. It wasn't anything special and the beef tasted freezer burned which is unacceptable considering that the place just opened. I also feel that the teriyaki sauce used wasn't very flavorful. The customer service was good and I received my food quickly however I don't think it was worth it for the price and probably won't come here again.",Kobeyaki,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Burgers"
