The cappuccino was good, nothing really to brag about. What surprised me was their vast and varied collection of board games that this place hosts. It's 5$ per head to sit down and play and a wonderful way to try out new board games to get to know which ones interest you the most before buying them.

Players are allowed to bring in outside food, which is helpful as some games can run a couple of hours.  Aether also just started severing coffee and tea, and they sell snacks like ice cream bars and potato chips.Lastly I want to mention that this is more than just a café with board games.  Aether café is a place you go for community.  The café workers will do their best to find a spot for a single player in an ongoing game and may ask you if there is space for one more in your game.  And as you might imagine, many of the other patrons are board game encyclopedias themselves and will introduce themselves to you, ask if you have played the game you are playing before, and them launch into a full on explanation of how to play the game or if you are unfamiliar with the game or start a conversion on why the game is great or why it is horrible.  Everyone I have met has been very friendly, but do expect to meet people with strong opinions about games.  *This may seem like a lot, but in terms of people whom are game hobbyist, I fall into the causal and/or party gamer category.",Aether Game Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Cafes,, Tabletop, Games"
