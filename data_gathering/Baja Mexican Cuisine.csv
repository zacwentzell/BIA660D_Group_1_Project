So, if you're anything like me (and have good taste) Baja Mexican Cuisine is def a place that you want to visit. Located a few blocks from what people would consider ""downtown Hoboken"", this place surely won't disappoint. My bf and I came here and enjoyed a delicious meal alongside two frozen margaritas each. Every single thing was delicious and our bartender (I really wish I got her name) was awesome and very attentive despite her being the only one working at the bar. Happy hour is only served at the bar and not outside which kind of sucks when you want to be in the good weather. You'll end up paying $11 for a frozen margarita if you sit outside as opposed to $5 if you sit at the bar.

On such a cold/rainy Sunday, the place wasn't too busy. We walked in and were greeted right away by some friendly staff. The decor in the dining area had some nice Aztec art up. They had several different sauces assorted from every table which was neat. We got some margaritas, I had the passion margarita. Omg these margs were off the chain! One of the best tasting margaritas I had, and that's hard to top from the ones back in Texas :). I was craving chicken tortilla soup due to the weather, and oh man it hit the spot! Loaded with plenty of chicken, it was delicious. Also ordered some steak nachos were a good compliment. They do not slack on the protein, and give you a good portion for the price.

49,EQ_7GJMhrdM4RaQTXa0iNQ,Heather L.,5.0 star rating,"I'd like to refute a review from two months ago that I was just notified of regarding Baja Mexican Restaurant, in Hoboken, NJ.  My date of a few nights ago, at Baja, alerted me of the review and wondered how anyone could say such a thing about Ashley, the bartender, by whom he was immediately charmed, as we all were. I've been a patron of this establishment for over 20 years, and one reason people keep coming  back, locals, anyway, is that the staff hired to work behind the bar is nothing short of delightful. A reviewer named Lisa R, who claims to have been a regular patron is stretching the truth in her illicit review of bartender Ashley. And this I know, because I was there the night of the reported misbehavior by Ashley, and I witnessed it all.Am I one of Ashley's paramours, coming to ogle her, or perhaps entice her in to her ""lady of the night activities?""  Nope, I'm a straight woman old enough to be Ashley's mother, and also a testament to Ashley's lively, sometimes sassy personality that keeps regular patrons--men, and women, coming in as one always feels at home sitting at the bar when she's tending it.There's nothing pretentious at all about this beautiful young girl, nor is there a ""ghetto"" vibe as was hinted in Lisa R's use of the word ""hood"", as if to imply that in addition to her ""lady of the night""' activities for which she purportedly seeks a side income, she is uneducated and not well spoken.I bore witness to the customer, Lisa R, watch Ashley's every move, in jealousy, and nothing more. There was no man this patron was interested in, who was vying for Ashley's attention, so the misaligned animosity is absurd.I recall when the woman attempted to incite Ashley, firstly by telling this beautiful 24 year old that she looked ""old"", then telling her that it looked like she gained a lot of weight since she last saw her.Is this the friendly banter between a regular patron and a staff member? Doubt it.When the unsmiling reviewer, Ms Lisa, sat, watching Ashley and insulting her, Ashley retreated to a few of us, a few seats down, telling us what this woman was saying to her. We were livid as nothing Ashley did, short of being adorable, warranted this mean spirited behavior.  No hospitality industry workers are required to tolerate rude or abusive behavior,  so Ashley informed us that this woman was on her last nerve, and she was going to ask her to leave. Ashley delivered her warrant, telling her that she must pay her tab and leave.Reviewer Lisa did so, without much fanfare, but seemed to have taken out her real dissent over the situation behind the veil of an anonymous  review,, attempting to not only disparage a young lady's reputation, but, consequently, the establishment as well. Fortunately, despite her forewarning  in the faux review, I've not seen the likes of her in my near weekly visits to Baja, so it's quite likely that the promise to return for the great food, but ""leave no tip"", held about as much validity as the initial review.Heather L",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
50,puSTEzL-W6Pg1VM4O5IuLA,Jessica G.,1.0 star rating,"This place used to be good but I don't know what happened. My BF and I went there last week and sat on the patio. We waited 20min for a server and everyone around us seemed frustrated with the service as well. Someone (not our server) brought out chips and we were hungry so we ate those but had no water or anything to drink. When the server finally came over to take our order we ordered two margaritas. We didn't see her again for another 15 minutes, by the time she brought out our drinks they had sat at the bar so long that all the ice had completely melted. We went ahead and ordered another round which eventually  arrived the same way. Our food was brought out exactly an 1 and 30 min after we arrived. I had a fajita salad and my bf ordered a regular fajita. Both of our dishes (steak) were ice cold when she brought them to the table. My bf's fajita Veges were actually still raw and usually the fajitas are juicy and sizzling but there was zero juice and zero sizzle. We sent them back and they brought out the same (now microwaved) dishes 5 minutes later. Clearly we were unhappy but never offered a visit from the manager or even an apology. We wrote that off as a bad night and I decided to return tonight, this time for a to-go order. I ordered the same salad again (fajita salad with steak) and chips and salsa. I picked up the order at the bar and went home. As soon as I opened the bag I realized they did not include the chips and salsa which REALLY sucks because I use the salsa a salad dressing. I called the restaurant to let them know and whomever I spoke with was less than helpful. His exact words were ""what do you what me to do about it."" I told him I would like him to refund the money for the chips and salsa through grubhub and he agreed. After we disconnected I opened my salad, it was only a taco bowl with lettuce and some chopped up pieces of steak on top: no onion, no peppers, no cheese, no avocado... nothing that was supposed to be on the salad. I paid $22 for a worthless dry salad. I will not order from here again or go here. Complete disappointment!",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

She was all smiles and very quick to take our order and bring our food. The bus boys were also always on hand to clear away used dishes.Food/Drink: They have a solid drink menu but we just had water with our meal. The chips and salsa they bring taste great and really fresh. We asked for the most spicy salsa they had, of course, but were turned down, the waitress saying ""we don't have any spicy salsa."" However, I think it was just a language barrier. There was some habanero sauce on the table that I used and it was PERFECT!

I ordered a dirty martini and two stellas...after finishing my second Stella and was going to order a third, Ashley the bartender comes to me and says ""you know you had a bad attitude and I don't want you here anymore so I'm closing out your tab."" I was completely shocked by her attitude not knowing what sparked her rude behavior towards me. And this is after I  had lengthy conversations and a nice chat with the bar owner and his female hostess. Again I have been there several times, and being an excellent patron. No issues whatsoever.  But with Her attitude, demeanor and uncalled rude behavior for what seemed a territorial childish behavior, Baja may very well lose a very good customer. And all this happened after the owners were not present. Obviously things go in a different direction in ""hood"" behavior once the boss is gone and not looking.  And as I've heard before from other well paying customers it is not the first time her ""childish behavior"" has gotten Baja to lose patrons because Ashley felt threatened by a real women who make more than her and can stand on their own two feet and not rely on looks or lady of the night actions to make a living. She definitely only caters to the men who obviously only come there to ogle and admire her.  More power to her.  She is a beautiful girl but her actions are a turn off no matter how you dice it. So I  paid my tab which was only $25 and left.  Wasn't going to argue with an uneducated millenial who obviously thinks her shit don't stink. Kinda feel sorry for her. But like the adult that I am....I don't let stupid crap like this stop me from doing what I want. But I will go back for the food definitely but she won't  be getting tips from me. She's not deserving enough and she actually brings shame to those hardworking bartenders who dedicate their craft to customers, who after a long day at work, only want to relax and have a well deserved drink after a hard day at work.

The quac appetizer and chips were very good - and I generally do not like guac.  The nachos were one of those neat, organized arrangements of 10 chips - which I hate. Nachos should be a big'ol pile of chips and goo and if the offering is not, it should state that on the menu or, I feel, the waitress should mention it.Then the fun began... Two of our party of four ordered a burrito. After a few bites of mine, I thought it tasted funny. After a few more bites, I asked my wife to taste it. She noticed that the tortilla that the chicken.beans.etc. was wrapped in was completely uncooked - it was raw dough. They cooked all the meat and added the beans and cheese and then folded it all into a tortilla that was either not precooked or that they forgot to cook once it was filled. We asked for a cooked tortilla and then I transferred the insides to it. On my second bite, I got a 1.5 inch long chicken bone.  I decided I was done... I told the waitress that I did not want this meal. She offered to have another one made, but I declined.When we got the bill, I was surprised that I was charged for the ""chicken raw dough with bones burrito"".  I immediately went to the manager and explained to him what happened.  He had no qualms about taking that item off the bill and then he explained to me that the bones in the burrito were because they shred the chicken by hand, so that happens.Hmmmmm, no, it shouldn't...",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

We arrive at 8:45 and were told a 45 minute wait for a table (No problem with that). We sit at the bar - and proceed to wait 20 minutes while the bartender makes eye contact with all of us and continues stacking glasses and cleaning, oh - and skipping us over to take drink orders from people who came after us. Took us half an hour to get our drinks.Then the service got bad (exactly). We were seated, not even asked if we wanted drinks, water, anything. We order an appetizer (steak quesadilla, large) and informed the waiter that we would be splitting that appetizer (and then he informed us there was a $3 sharing charge for each person). We ordered our entrees as well (a burrito for myself, shrimp in garlic sauce for my friends).Then, after my 15th grandchild was born (seriously, about a 40 minute wait), our entrees come out. Wait you say, what happened to our appetizer?That's what we said. The waiter said he thought we canceled that, we at no point we did.My burrito - I won't lie, it was room temperature (burrito,rice, beans, all) but it was good. My friends shrimp in garlic sauce? You could have taken down a medieval castle with them and a trebuchet. I can bench press about 200 pounds - I couldn't cut the shrimp with a fork. They were rubbery as in your Mustang GT could use them like replacement tires. The sauce - which tasted nothing of garlic - seemed like a water down seafood stock. And the onions and peppers were crisp, as in lightly tossed in a hot liquid for a second crisp. Yea, exactly. I'm still confused.We ask for the manager - we're told, ""he went around for a walk down the block'. So the waiter brings us the second in command - a bus boy (my friends are both professional chefs, and I have managed two restaurants in my life time).

121,e3goGLJA8XnuVjsBR2KpKA,Mike S.,2.0 star rating,"Warning -- this review is lengthy, but it has a point:Went here for dinner with some friends tonight and was expecting some good, authentic Mexican. What we ended up getting was miserable service and only halfway-decent food. Okay, so the food isn't all that bad. I had a chicken burrito which was large, filling and messy. It wasn't very flavorful though, and there was a renegade chicken bone which I (thankfully) found with my teeth. There's just one problem: it was supposed to be a fajita. When the waiter came with our food, I told him that I ordered a fajita and he insisted that that's what I got. I responded by asking why my ""fajita"" looks like my buddy's burrito, and he said mine is the fajita because it has different vegetables in it. Baffled that someone at a Mexican restaurant doesn't know what a fajita is, I just decided to eat the damn thing. Again, it was all right, but clearly not what I ordered. Another friend ordered the enchiladas which were supposed to come with red sauce, and they came with green. When she asked for red sauce, the waiter said that ""only the style she ordered comes with green sauce."" According to the menu, she was indeed supposed to have red sauce. Again, we didn't argue it and just dug in. When the check came:-we were charged for two margaritas (my friend had one)-we were charged for a small guacamole (we had a large)-we were charged for two burritos (remember, I was told I had a fajita, not a burrito) -my friend who was supposed to get sour cream with her tacos got charged extra for it as if it were a side-Corona's were $5; we were charged about $5.60 per bottleMost of those mistakes worked in our favor, so we only mentioned the two margarita mistake, but it's very clear that this waitstaff doesn't have it together at all.

That's not too long in general, but we're talking about a Sunday afternoon at 2-3pm when there were more staff than customers in the place.The food was decent, I suppose. I had shrimp Acapulco, which was deep-fried shrimp with cheese and sauce. It actually tasted like a cheap and somewhat incomplete parmesan, and was incredibly heavy. On the other hand, the shrimp were huge--but that's why the dish cost $18. My friend got a vegetable burrito which he enjoyed, and I'm pleased to say that the salsa and tortilla chips that came with our meal were both pretty decent. The salsa was actually spicy, and that's not something I say about every Mexican restaurant.Overall, I'd characterize my experience at Baja as mixed. I certainly wasn't impressed, but on the other hand, I didn't have an awful experience either. I went to Baja once before with a friend on a Saturday night, and I recall that the service and food were each far better, but this time was just eh.I'd say, head to Baja if you're in the mood for Mexican and it's a busy hour. Otherwise, keep moving and find something else.",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

126,8TvEfBE0LDgIwd5wg_JxVA,Nazim P.,4.0 star rating,"I guess I should give it five stars because I was super-hungry by the time my cousin and I had found parking. But, fair is fair.You enter Baja Mexican Cuisine using the far-right door, which takes you into a bar. Once you pass the bar counter, you can wait to be seated; you get seated in a different section where the room is set up with tables that can seat two, four, six or more. To be more accurate -- and not rude -- the length of each section (bar and seating area) is about one-and-a-half letter train length and size (or one train length): the seating situation may be a bit much on a busy night, but we went on a Thursday evening.Baja Mexican's food is fresh, from what I noticed, while eating. The preparation was not too quick and speedy, nor did they take forever to make your dish. The food was fresh and the quality was on par. Waiting service and drink quality was to my liking; our waiter was not too overwhelming nor too absent.To be quite honest, what I paid for my meal was exactly what I expected to pay and I got my bang for the buck.

I asked for the menu and pointed out that chicken or steak both cost the same. Again, he was defensive and said ""that's the price in the machine"". When I spoke to the manager in duty she was quick to make us feel stupid by saying things like ""No, steak costs more."" or ""Maybe you did not read the price correctly"". Mind you that she had the menu opened in her hand. After a few minutes we finally asked her to look at the price. When she took another look her response, I will never forget, was ""Oh, well look at that! That's a mistake."" We were told that we can leave our name for ""management review"" if we wanted a credit.

I was sorely disappointed in the food, atmosphere and restaurant staff. The restaurant and bar were empty when I arrived around 8 pm, I was seated quickly but that's where the positive aspects of the experience stopped. To start, I ordered guacamole which was given in a great proportion, however, it was absolutely tasteless. For my entree I ordered steak fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken bisteca mexicana. The fajitas had a good amount of streak, but no fajita vegetables. There were two slices of peppers used as garnish and that was it. The chicken dish was awful and was comprised of diced grilled chicken and diced tomatoes. To make matters worse, after the dishes were delivered the waitress was nowhere to be found for about 25 minutes. The icing on the cake for me (and probably a little funny to those reading) was that the whole time I was here, I couldn't help but notice that they were blasting crappy pop music.

It was extremely cheesy and delicious.  It came with thin, warm tortillas, but they masked the creaminess and flavor that came when enjoying the mixture on its own.  We then tried the Chicken Fajitas, which were amazing!  The chicken was tender and well-seasoned.  It was served over grilled onions and under a slice of green pepper and tomato.  The plate also included flavorful rice and a bowl of black beans (could also get refried ones).  It came with sides of sour cream, guacamole, and tortillas.  I highly recommend this place.",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Nachos and salsa is delicious and endless service (you may have to ask for more) There is tequila a plenty and more than just Cuervo and Sauza. I'd go there again for good mexican food.",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

I'm a straight-scotch drinker but I'll always dabble in the fruity frozen arts here. I detest going out to have mexican food because, well... it's never real Mexican or even close. But Baja is surprisingly as close as we'll get. If your friends grab the waiter while you're not looking and tell them its your birthday... you're in for a nice surprise ;o)If you like busy, loud, and tight tequila fun... this is a nice, classy, and experienced place that's well-managed. Enjoy and Arrrrrrrriiba!",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

I've come here numerous times and mostly end up full and satisfied.  I will warn that the experience here is basically hit or miss - it can go from being very good one time to rushed and crappy the next.  You just have to be lucky and hope you come on a good night (odds are it will be).  Since I have been here so many times I will give an overall review of my experience there.Service:The service here is just like everything else - hit or miss.  I have had very nice waiters one time to very cold waiters the next.  The service isn't necessarily bad...just the waiters aren't that personable or friendly.  I will have to say that the service here is probably my least favorite thing about this place.  Considering I come here so often and have gotten many friends into them I would hope they would give me better service but surprisingly not.  When I went this past weekend our server wasn't that friendly and left our cups and chips empty without coming back to refill them.  Also he never asked if I wanted refried beans or black and they gave me refried (I prefer black beans).  This isn't the first time that has happened and I find that quite annoying since I don't like to return anything. I do have to give a shout out to the bartender that night though.  She was probably the nicest person I have dealt with there.  I met up with some friends after dinner there for drinks and she came over and brought us some chips without us asking.  She was taking shots with some other people at the bar towards the end of the night.  Much more personable than other bartenders I have seen here.FoodI have tried many things here but was surprised this time when I went that they updated the menu.  They have a few choices I haven't noticed before and also have a new brunch/lunch menu.  Whenever you start a meal you are served tortilla chips with salsa.  Usually the chips are warm and crunchy.  I have come a few times though when the chips were stale and tasteless.  This past time though the chips were very yummy and the salsa was delish.Main Courses I have tried before include:* Baja salad with chicken - very good and chicken is tasty.  Wish it wasn't served though with iceberg and romaine lettuces.* Alambre Cancún - it's skewered chicken and shrimps served over rice and beans. The chicken is cut thick and juicy.  Good choice.* Chicken/Shrimp/Beef Fajitas - one of my favorites here! the meat is sooo fresh and succulent.  You don't get rubbery meat you might find at some chain Mexican joints.  The beef fajitas are probably my fave. All are served with rice/beans. I recommend trying one of the fajitas if it is your first time here.* Chicken Fajita Burrito - another one of my faves which I usually order.  It is covered in their house sauce which really sets it apart from other burritos.  Not the greasy kind you might get in other places.  It is served with guacamole and rice.* Baja special - this is THE DISH to get if you have 2 or 3 people who want fajitas.  It is essentially the ULTIMATE fajita experience.  A gigantic portion of the chicken, shrimp, and beef fajitas with plenty of cheese, beans, and rice.  Get to try them all! If you are in the mood for a true feast go for this.I haven't tried but come highly recommended:* Red Snapper Tacos* Pollo Leticia - seems to be new to the menu* Arroz con Pollo - same as above* Any of their Salmon dishes+ tons morePortions are generous and I never leave hungry (probably because I pig out on the chips haha)Their margaritas are very good and they have tons of flavors.  I have had so many so I can't really remember them all right now but you really can't go wrong unless it sounds gross lol.  Location/Atmosphere Located conveniently in uptown Hoboken on the corner of Washington street, it is easy to get to.  The place is always packed when I have gone and has a great vibe to it.  They recently added outdoor seating which is a great change up.Overall:Of all the Mexican places in Hoboken I have tried this has to be my favorite.  All the other places downtown served lower quality food typical of Mexican chains.  If you are looking for appetizing Mexican food that isn't too greasy definitely come here for an enjoyable meal.  You won't leave disappointed (or hungry lol).",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

We sit at the bar because we love Adam and Tina. They always make our day and are the nicest people we've met here so far! They also make the best skinny margheritas and awesome Sangria. Our favorite place for date night. We are never disappointed.,Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

The Baja Special is delicious and always a crowd pleaser. The restaurant is a little tight, but the atmosphere feels nice. We have gone with and without children. The tight space makes it tricky but nonetheless, we enjoyed a meal there tonight with 4 kids!",Baja Mexican Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
