1,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"I don't typically trust food trucks with zero social media presence. I also don't typically trust food trucks with confusing signage - I believe this roving Greek eatery is called Tony's Souvlaki Plus, with the subtitle Taste of Greece, as both monikers are plastered equally across a bright Mykonos Blue vehicle. I also don't always trust full meals that cost $7 (but certainly appreciate the savings).But I do trust my tastebuds, and they tell me this Chicken Souvlaki Plate is fresh and delicious. It's served over a side salad with a yogurt-cucumber white sauce and a fistful of fries. It's not gourmet, but it's by no means dicey either. It's an appropriate, clean, sizable, satisfying, maybe near-craveworthy seven dollars well spent.My first trip to this truck was due to office word-of-mouth. I encountered no line and the guy was nice enough to offer me a free piece of chicken when I was deciding between souvlaki and breast options. This latest time, there were more prospective customers mingling about and the workers may have started to get overwhelmed, but still handled orders effectively and professionally. Which goes to show, social media shortfalls, confusing truck names, and otherwise questionably low prices be damned - good food will draw a good crowd. For me, that's enough to grant Tony's a coveted spot in my regular lunch rotation.",Taste of Greece,5.0 star rating,$,"Food, Trucks,, Fast, Food,, Mediterranean"

This truck was sitting on Hudson and Houston street.  The left side had a written menu while the right side contained pictures. The workers quickly noticed me trying to make a decision and came to speak to me. I loved the customer service.  I ordered the gyro with onions ,tomatos, white sauce topped with french fries. I requested that my french fries be placed in a  separate container. This meal was fufilling.",Taste of Greece,5.0 star rating,$,"Food, Trucks,, Fast, Food,, Mediterranean"
