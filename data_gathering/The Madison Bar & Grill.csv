Our food came out pretty quick but it took quite some time to get orders placed. Place and ambiance: these were ok, nothing spectacular, cross between a family restaurant meets pub. My part of six was seated at a table with a severe incline, it was even funny. Our water even spilled over due to the steep incline. Food: meh meh meh, nothing was bad but nothing was good either, everything was stuck in that neutral Zone. My biggest complaint was the chicken with waffles, it wasn't the typical fried chicken, this was what seemed to be oven roasted chicken picked apart and placed over the waffle. I think they should have at least specified that on the menu. On of the biggest disappointments is when something is totally not what you were expecting, its like when my husband calls and says he's picking up Chinese for dinner and walks in with a pizza box ‍. To top that off they just could not get our drinks right. First they made a white sangria with Tequila and when it was as returned it was brought out tasting exclusively like water with Splenda and syrup, when sent back once again they thought they would solve that by adding wine. They were nice enough to take it of the check without asking. Anyways, I don't think I would be back.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

I have been here many times for drinks and for food. I believe they do offer complementary parking, but please don't quote me on that. The food is just a step above bar food but does the job. The prices are reasonable and the wait time is not bad. I would highly recommend this bar to anyone looking for a more mature crowd and a nice atmosphere.

If you live in Hoboken and want to escape the underage out-of-towners that go to downtown bars, this is your spot. The music is fun - it's usually a mix of Top 40 and throwbacks. There's barely ever a line but it does get packed and sweaty - nobody likes an empty bar though. I love this bar because if you go on a weeknight or during the day you can actually sit and eat/order drink specials. They have the best dirty martini in Hoboken in my opinion and Tuesdays they have half off martinis. Wednesdays they do half off bottles of wine and rose. On a nice Wednesday afternoon I stopped by with a friend, we ordered a half priced bottle of rose and 2 dozen half shell clams, sat outside with a slightly obstructed city view and it was such a relaxing experience.

Given how much they charge 13-20/entree and 31/buffet I thought it would be a good place. Told they had huge parties coming so I had to either sit at the bar or wait. We chose to sit at the bar and nightmare started from here. One bartender for the entire bar area. She was chatting away with other waiters and not paying any attention of guest sitting down. When we walked all the way down to grab her attention she reluctantly came with menus. I ordered a three egg omelette. Came the omelette and it was just eggs!! I went to ask why it was just eggs and none of the ingredients listed were added. She said you didn't say you want other stuff in your eggs. ""So it is just three eggs cooked in omelette style?"" ""Yes."" ""But you did not mention to me when i ordered I needed to choose."" And she just shrugged. What people in their right mind would order a 13 dollar ""omelette"" without anything else in it?!?!

108,JFtCfwvXUviyp9PHc5iU4w,Kristen P.,3.0 star rating,"After being a Hoboken resident for over 3 years....I finally gave The Madison Bar and Grill a try. I've heard consistently mediocre feedback from other  Hoboken locals, so I've never had the desire to go out of my way to make the trip.From my experience, you don't go to The Madison for mind-blowing food or beautiful location. You go to The Madison for their awesome specials, lengthy beer/wine list and extremely friendly service.After walking by on a random Monday after getting off the bus uptown, I noticed a sign outside the restaurant for ""First Seating Meal - 3 courses for $18.12, every Monday 5:00PM-10:00PM. Happy Hour 4:00PM-7:00PM."" Seeing as it was 5:45PM...this looked like the best deal I've seen in Hoboken yet! So my boyfriend met me and we stopped in for an early dinner/happy hour date night.We were seated outside, and the hostess did warn us about the noise we would experience from the buses turning onto Washington at the traffic light...but I wasn't prepared for how loud it would really be! After a couple glasses of happy hour wine (Happy Hour 4:00PM-7:00PM half off ALL BEERS and house wines), it didn't bother me. The First Seating Menu was a pre-fixe 3 course menu for $18.12. Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and more than accommodating when we asked if we could have a glass of wine before ordering, and have our courses fired after we've finished each round of drinks.Here's the food round-up (expect small portions for the pre-fixe menu special):Appetizers:-Fried Calamari with a Chili-Lime Aioli: Not the best calamari I've had, but not the worst. It tasted like it was definitely frozen. My boyfriend said it was very ""meaty"" calamari, and I agreed that it wasn't over breaded, but it was room temperature when it was served to me which was a little disappointing.  I wasn't impressed with the aioli...it tasted like mayo mixed with chili powder and a squirt of lime. All I tasted was the chili powder...and not in a good spicy way. -Crab Cake: The seasoning was pretty good, but the cake itself was soggy and lukewarm. I prefer my crab cakes crisp and hot.Entrees:-Shrimp and Lobster Ravioli in a Cajun Cream Sauce: Obviously not handmade ravs, not that I expected them to be. Honestly this dish had no flavor other than salty. The ""Cajun Cream Sauce"" tasted almost exactly like the Chili-Lime Aioli that was served with the calamari, it almost tasted like a powdered mix.-Teriyaki Glazed Salmon: The tastiest dish I tried! The salmon itself was cooked very well (well as in technique, not temperature). The glaze tasted like it was most likely out of a bottle, but it was flavorful. It was served with risotto (Parmesan?) which was very cheesy and DELICIOUS. It was also served with a mango salsa that looked good, but was devoured by my boyfriend before I could taste it!Dessert:-Cannolis: I'm not a big fan of dessert or cannolis, but my boyfriend thought they were really good. The shells were crunchy and the filling was tasty.-Cookie Dough Gelato: I mean....how can you really go wrong with cookie dough anything? It was a great way to end the meal.All in all, I would go back to The Madison for this special! It honestly was what I expected, and for two 3 course dinners, 4 beers and 4 glasses of wine....the bill came to $85!! And the service was excellent!

Like they feel as if, ""No, we're making too much money, here a few reasons you shouldn't eat here ever again."" That's how my experiences here have been.Last month, I made reservations here on Open Table. Upon arrival, I was told that they wouldn't honor those reservations because they were already full and had no space. The hostess said that as she stood in a nearly empty dining room. Fine. OK. I returned there today, asking for a table on their open patio and was asked to wait 5-10 minutes and ended up waiting about 20. Maybe they were trying to see how long they could push the wait without us leaving. Or really just took their time. We waited it out of obstinacy and because we were starving. Just a few highlights from dinner:-- We'll start with a compliment: the beer list is pretty deep and solid with good craft beers.-- A friend ordered a Taylor ham and egg burger. It arrived without the Taylor ham. ""Oh, do you still want the Taylor ham?"" the waitress asked when told of the, um, oversight. Yeah.-- The lamb burger almost literally exploded. As I squeezed it and was about to bite into it, a voluminous amount of juice squirted out and all over my shirt. I've eaten a lot of burgers in my life and not one has ever done that. -- The food is fine but nothing special, but it is pricey.

With average expectations, we made a reservation through open table 2 days early. I have been to the Madison many times when I first bought in Hoboken, I stopped going a few years ago, but thought if should be fun, the company is outstanding, not expecting much, so everything should be ok.When we arrived we were told we had to wait for them to ""find us a table"", even though the restaurant was nearly empty. So after a long wait, we were ushered to a table in the back, in the dark, which I can only describe as nestled in the kitchen runway... we were directly told, in no uncertain terms, that ""we have another party that is coming in an hour"". Although I said nothing of the time, and wish that I had, and wish that I just left. I should have been smart enough to to say, Frankly, I don't think an all you can eat brunch has a time limit. The food and ambiance had its own inherent time limit. Not all you can eat, but all you can stand. The food sucked, the three member band was quite good, but we couldn't hear them from our table, in another room, in the back, in the dark, over the clatter of the dishes and yelling of the waitstaff. I even got a call on my phone partway through brunch curtly asking if, ""I was going to honor my reservation and come to brunch"". After saying we were already there three times, I finally got up and introduced myself to the argumentative hostess who could not have cared less about her job, and, was whist-fully engaged at looking out the window.  The last straw was the cheap tongue curling mimosas, one member of our party opted out of the inclusive free drink. And, instead had a small glass of orange juice. I said, ok give me his drink and charge me for the orange juice which is cheaper than the not free mimosa. Which the server refused to do. Really? $33 a person and 6 people, and, this simple customer curtesy could not be done. I used to wait tables. What the $&;))@..... They will never get another dime from me.

Our waiter never once came and asked us how was our food, how were we doing, etc. I'm sorry but this establishment needs a new chef that has a taste bud. Over priced for sucky food. But I will say the white sangria was AMAZING !! But my friend drink summer raven tasted like gasoline",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Confused about what to get for a late dinner we decided to go with the French onion soup dumplings and the burger with all the trimmings. First it took about an hour for them to come (past 10:30pm), it was cold then tasted as stale as leftover bread. The only thing that was right was the temperature of the meat. For a place we love, we were so disappointed. Basically, do not order delivery from them but dining in is fine. It just seemed like since it was later in the evening they did not care about the quality of the food.

It's not so fancy that you're scared you'll break the bank, but the quality of the food is excellent and the crowd is amiable.I've ordered quite a variety of items off of their menu. One of my favorite menu items is the Warm Herbed Goat Cheese salad, probably because I love goat cheese! The rest of the salad is par for the course and can be ordered with chicken, steak, fish, or shrimp for a few extra bucks. I'm also a big fan of their French Onion soup, but beware... if you add it to your meal it will put you back $8, which seems a little steep to me. I've also ordered their MBG burger, which is undeniably excellent - flavorful and cooked just how you order it. The fries are also well worth the extra calories!I was lucky enough to visit during Hudson Restaurant Week for lunch and tried a few new items - I was blown away by the appetizer and dessert. I started with the Appalachian Nachos made of homemade potato chips with BBQ sauce, cheddar, monterey jack, and blue cheese crumbles. It sounds heavy - and it certainly wasn't ""light"" but the way everything is baked together it's more a smorgasbord of flavors and less of a heavy layered dish. For dessert I topped off my meal with the cinnamon gelato and I'm STILL day dreaming about it! Absolutely perfect. My main course was the shrimp BLT, which I had contemplated ordering on previous visits. It was good, but surrounded by the nachos and gelato it wasn't the strongest dish. If you missed Restaurant Week, The Madison regularly hosts an early dinner 3-course first-seating special menu for $18.12 each, plus the option to purchase a $15 bottle of wine to accompany your meal.

All my friends were sick of me telling them to come here. A few months ago... I completely stopped. Their food completely went downhill. The quality, portions, and their presentation rivals only a local watering hall. Last time I went, my wife ordered the melon salad.... It was a bowl with sliced melons placed around the edges and just a bag of greens in the middle. Yeah... Real creative. Chef could complete on Chopped. The food? So bad recently. I used to love their Salmon with Risotto but now? The salmon seems to have gotten smaller, and their risotto is literally disgusting. That night I also got the Mac and cheese. Waste. Kraft microwave Mac and cheese tastes better. I mean.. Seriously. Try a LITTLE harder. I hate leaving a bad review, especially because I loved this place- but it is what it is. The only reason why it got 2 stars is because the service is decent, and the cheese and bread they bring out to the table is actually delicious.

I was shocked that my plate looked so empty and it didn't come with any sides. Okay fine, I get it, lobster is high quality good so the raviolis must be delicious. They were not. The outside was so tough and I've had ravioli from Trader Joes that was so much better and $3. I also wasn't impressed with the service. Our server was indeed very nice however not efficient, I was given incorrect happy hour info (Martinis were excluded when I was told that they were a part of the HH special) so I changed my drink order to a margarita which wasn't even on the menu I received. We finished our drinks right after our app and weren't asked for another drink until we finished our dinner. I'd get it if they were busy but at 545pm on a Monday it was dead. We paid our bill with a credit card and didn't get a pen. Okay, tracked down a gentlemen (a busser) who tried really hard to find us one. Not really a deal braker but just frustrating.

161,Lu60GaKNGWfZKhN6NTn_mA,Judy R.,2.0 star rating,"I was excited when I saw the LivingSocial deal for a Hoboken restaurant so I bought two coupons. The first time, we order the hanger steak and the jambalaya. We thought the food was okay... More like a 3-star restaurant. However, the food is way over-priced which we didn't think was a big deal since this is Hoboken and the service was not bad. Today, my birthday marked the 2nd and the very last day that my husband and I will ever eat at Madison. Right off the bat, the waitress told us that we cannot order from the prix fixe menu because we have a LivingSocial coupon. Okay... My father-in-law ordered the ravioli $18, I ordered the steak frites $32, and my husband ordered the salmon $23.  We ordered wine and apps (crab cakes $12 and mussels $10 which were both good) with our dinners. SERVICE:After taking our order, the waitress did not check on us until we were half way through our entrees. Well, except for when I had to flag her down to get another seafood fork and more bread. When she did finally come back to check on us she  only asked my father-in-law if he wanted more wine. She didn't ask if our dinner was okay so far and/or if we needed anything else. Second time she stopped, same thing. She asked my husband if he wanted another glass of wine. And of course, the last two times was to give us our bill and run the credit card.FOOD:The appetizers were good. The mussels were especially delicious.  But sad to say, the apps were the best part of the meal. Crab cakes were good.Ravioli: when it arrived, I thought we were in a Mexican restaurant because the cheese raviolis were completely covered in the green sauce (artichoke puree) with shredded cheese on top. You can imagine what that looks like! After FIVE (5) bites my father-in-law politely said ""Meh, it was okay"". Believe me, he's a simple man and not a food credit so for him to say that, it must have been a pretty GROSS dish.Steak Frites: My meal, the most expensive thing on the menu (I think), arrived with JUST a monster of a steak plopped on a plate. The truffle fries came separately. That's it! Would it have killed them to put a smidgen of parsley on the steak? Really? I didn't know that I was in a dinner. Obvs, if you're charging fine dining prices, I'd expect a restaurant to present it with something. Nope. Though, I would have to admit, the steak was good. However, the ""truffle fries"" were pathetic. They were overcooked and dry.Salmon: My husband's dish was overall ""alright"". The fish was done properly but the risotto was gross! I tasted it. Trader Joes' frozen risottos are way better!Okay, I'm sick of writing about this place. I'm over it. In summary, the restaurant overcharges for mediocre food. The service today was terrible.

We said no and then she walked away.No I'm sorry for being gone for an hour, no would you like another glass of sangria? That one looks like even the ice has melted over the last hour..

At just $16.13 a person you have a contender for the best priced first seating / prefix menu in Hoboken. Wines from the first seating menu are all $15.The portions have been called perfect by other diners. At first site of the appetizer I thought it was on the small side, but I must say that the 3 courses really do add up. I've enjoyed the crab cake alot, crispy and good not alot of breading. Will probably remember to ask for the sauce on the side next time since it started to make the bottom of the crab cake soggy. Otherwise it was top notch. Also liked the six choices for the entrees. Ended up falling in love with the creamy polenta and the tender free-range chicken. As close to what Mama Tattoli used to make me growing up.The two mini cannoli's come with a great chocolate dipping sauce for dessert.I really try to come here anytime I get out of work early enough for the first seating.

SPEEDThey take about 30-40 minutes max (from their location to 2nd street) to arrive. Food is never soggy or gross.FOODSliders: We order these every time. All sliders come in 3, served in mini fluffy potato buns (YES THE YELLOW ONES). Cheeseburger: The cheeseburger/hamburger variations are okay at best - just   char-grilled little patties. Pulled pork: The pulled pork is DELICIOUS, and I am hella picky with my pulled pork. Or any kind of pork, for that matter. Their pork has texture while being tender (it's not that fake flossy crap that relies solely on BBQ sauce to be called ""pulled pork""). And they stuffed those tiny little potato buns with a ton of meat. Very filling, I usually can't finish all three for dinner. Meatball: Pretty good, one mini meatball per bun. Steak: Filet mignon meat in its own juice. It's good at best, but I may be biased since I was never a fan of filet mignon.If you're not sure which set of sliders to try first, go for the pulled pork!Parmesan/Pecorino/Truffle oil fries: We order these every time. Shoestring fries that are perfectly soggy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Comes with a horseradish dipping sauce that compliments the cheese well. This is probably why I can never  finish my sliders.Grilled Ahi Tuna with Spicy Black Bean, Yucca Frita, and Sweet Plantain Salsa: Holy crap. You know, you would think that ordering an entree (especially a SEAFOOD entree) for delivery would be a bad idea. This is a FLAVOR PARTY EXPLOSION in my mouth. The combination of all 4 textures and flavors made me feel like I was having a savory steak dinner. Black beans weren't boring or plain, the Yucca was fried tasty goodness, and the plantain salsa tasted like an unripe mango chutney. All good things. I imagine this would taste even better when served fresh at the restaurant.Side of kale: I ordered this one night because I wanted some greens. I wasn't expecting anything great because it's a side dish, but their kale is pretty awesome. I have no idea what they do to the kale, because I've been trying to replicate it, and my version sucks. Their wilted kale is garlicky, a bit salty, and probably has some butter in it.

My Caesar salad was as bland as any I have ever had anywhere. The dressing was a white, runny liquid that lacked any flavor whatsoever. My girl had the mussels which were above average. My entree was the pork tenderloin which was cooked very well and had a supremely spicy jerk seasoning which I enjoyed. We sat in the lounge area but there is also a nice dining room.

I say that mainly because that's all the bar area was filled with when I walked in the door. I think I was the youngest guy there who could legally drink. Not like that was a problem though because within ten minutes of being there I was being offered shots from soccer moms and corporate executives. And let me tell you, these people can put them down. I mainly stopped in at the Madison to test the place out during happy hour. Aside from the crowd, the bar was very nice and had a wide variety of drinks being offered. Happy hour runs from 4pm to 8pm, which beer and mixed drinks are half off. I had four Bud heavies there and I think my total came to $12. I thought they got the bill wrong at first since I had just paid that amount for one drink in Manhattan a week ago. The bar staff was pretty cool and always made sure your cup was full. Most of the people there seemed to know the staff by first name so I am guessing if you return repeatedly they treat you well. I did not try anything off the menu, but from what I hear the place has really good food. That and when I always walk past the place the outdoor seating is usually full.

Yet I've given this place too many second chances to be fooled anymore. The menu itself boasts very little options; in my opinion the chef tries to experiment and be exploratory with the food, but it's average at best. I agree with most people who write that the food tastes like it's reheated, it is. Moreover, the servers all seem like they could care less and they're just trying to run out the clock.

We visited for Hudson Restaurant Week and split:- the strawberry fields salad which wasn't overdressed at all but could have used a splash more of acidity.-Appalachian Nachos... perfect balance of onion, bbq sauce, blue cheese, etc. These were truly unique nachos and definitely fun to split with a dinner/lunch guest -Blanco pizza: The dough was sweet and yeasty with a bit too much crust for my liking but still a great consistency. The overall toppings needed a bit more juice.. perhaps a splash of oil or even a squeeze of lemon-Shrimp & bacon club sandwich: looooved that this was on rye bread, it definitely added to the layers of flavor. The bacon overpowered the whole sandwich, but it was cooked beautifully. -My lunch guest had the vanilla bean gelato and i was very jealous over it... it was incredible. I had the key lime cheesecake which didn't have any of that zesty key lime flavor i was looking for... Half price martini tuesdays were a pleasant surprise.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday last week for a nice dinner and I was delighted to see that they offered an early-bird dinner special until 8 for only $18.12 a person. Having looked at the menu prior to making reservations, the dishes sounded as tasty as they were.The bread that comes on the table is delicious. I kinda wish we asked for a second helping! We ordered a tuna tar-tare platter as our appetizer, which was tasty but a little difficult to eat. It comes with very crispy tortilla pieces that are hard to crunch into, so I used my fork for the most part. With the early bird special, we also ordered an appetizer of calamari with a selection of dipping sauces, which was also tasty.We both ordered the hanger steak meal which came with rice, black beans, and salsa verde. The steak was cut and seasoned well and the sides perfectly complimented the food. The portions look small at first, but I was filled right up after polishing off the dish.

Also on Sundays and Mondays, the stroller brigade congregates and  the place fills up with young parents and their children.  I am not interested in hearing crying babies or having toddlers wandering around the bar.

(though not everyone used the stick to get chocolate onto their fruit, opting to use their hands so I opted out of the chocolate fountain) The service was perfect.  A nice way to spend a sunday.  We got there about 115 pm. it wasn't crowded. and there were open seats.  parking was a bit of a task but found a spot about a block away. drove around twice.The arrangement of the buffet isn't good.  it's in the bar area. we sat in the dining area, so we had to walk by the entrance and hostess desk to get food. also, there were tables pretty close to the buffet which felt a bit crowded.I recommend and I will be back.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Over the years, every time my parents visit, they always want to come here! It's kind of a tradition now. They deliver, too, so sometimes we'll just hang out in my apartment and order, like, 50 of their sliders (hahaha those sliders are soooo good!) As far as my favorite things to eat, I really like all the tuna dishes they do, and I've had every kind of slider of theirs dozens of times. : D Their roast chicken is also mad good, my dad gets that pretty much every time. In fact, I'm kind of realizing now that my entire family, for all the times we've been here, is really only qualified to talk about 15% of the menu. XD We order the same things just about every time.

For dinner the food is excellent, been there a few times for just food and it has been delicious. I'll start with that...We've been a few times all of which  were inspired  by either a gift certificate or a living social deal. But, each time we went we got a ton of food. This last visit we started with the mini calzones which were all incredible, and HUGE. The three ""mini"" calzones could have been a meal in and of itself.  I ordered Madison's version of a bolognese, whoa...mind blowing good! This is not your Nonna's red sauce. This was braised pork, a tomato base sauce and creme fraiche on top. It was literally heavenly. I was so full from the calzones though I couldn't finish it, but it made a great dinner at home the next night. The portion sizes are pretty good. We were also there for $5 martini night, I believe it was a Tuesday. This is one helluva a deal. My fiance loved her food as well, but I can't remember what she had. We ordered the banana split for desert. It of course was delicious but also giant. I had a food baby after leaving Madison. For the food, I give them 4 stars. They switched servers on us midway thru which was odd because the other server was still there, no transition they just did it, didn't really matter but weird nonetheless.As for the bar on a Friday or Saturday night, this is a cougar den. No if, ands or buts about it. I'm 30 (I was 29 at the time) and I felt out of place. This is an older crowd, not so much for guys but for a lot of older women, now they also limit the age of guys allowed in, men have to be over the age of 25 to enter. Not that this applies to me, but that shows you they prefer the older crowd. It was also a wee bit douchey and really hard to get a drink at the bar, it is really tiny, drinks are expensive and the place is just too packed with people wearing fedoras and sunglasses at night.

I came back here on a date and had an equally awesome time. I ordered the Turkey burger (which came on an English muffin) and came with a side salad.  We sat in the bar area and it was very crowded by 6:30 PM and a bit noisy so if you want something quiet go to the dining room instead.

While a decent fake ID could get you into most of Hoboken's bars, Madison was always different. It was way uptown, the age limit was supposedly 25 and up, and you always wondered ""what the hell is it like in there?""Well, fast forward a few years later, when I finally got the chance to go in.  I went on a Friday night... no cover, which was good. Line was only a few people long... ok so far.We walked inside, and were greeted with what seemed like a thousand people listening to the same music that I could hear on z100. There was a super long bar, and then a standing area (I'd hesitate to call it walking area since it took 10 mins just to get anywhere remotely close to the bar). This place reeks of Green Rock and Shannon, my 2 other least favorite bars in Hoboken. At least there was no artificially created line outside, so I won't give it a 1.  If you like the frat party scene and want to  share it with 28 year olds.. then come here.  1.5 stars, bumped up because there was no cover or line.

But if you go for dinner and want an entree, be prepared to spend some money. I love their classics like the turkey burger or chicken panini. They have some great, innovative apps, but I would not recommend anything lobster related; the one time I ate it, it didn't taste like the freshest thing on the market. I have eaten their seafood though, including the tuna and crabcakes, and have been quite pleased. Madison offers specials throughout their menu as well, beyond just entrees, which I appreciate.

I felt like the waitress could have been more attentive (e.g. she was slow to refill the water and took a while to bring the check). Overall I haven't explored the menu much and typically stick with the MBG signature blue label burger.

Tonight I went in there alone (again) for one more try and have decided that the food is a notch above mediocre, but the service is unacceptable and the reason I won't return. I was a waiter for several years in college in a place very much like this. I learned it doesn't take much to be good at it. Tonight I waited incredibly long for EVERYTHING - from the waiter greeting me and taking an order (only after I got up and inquired with the hostess) to paying the check - every departure of the waiter was an eternity until he returned. He never asked if things were ok or if I needed something after the food came. In fact I was loooong done with it before seeing him again. I asked for a dessert menu. Waited forever. And then waited forever again for him to ask me what I decided - which at that point the answer was ice cream from the supermarket so I could get the hell out of there. Of course I waited forever for the check and for him to run the credit card. What a mess. It's sad. They lost my dessert purchase and any possible future business.

250,Tvoi-tiOiCg429kMoueysg,James M.,1.0 star rating,"Went to Madison's last friday as my GF(Hi Annie) bought the living social deal. Decent meal. I ordered the hanger steak. Decent sized skirt steak with chopped plantains and basmati rice. The steak had  a different taste to it- would not have surprised me if was grass fed. My GF got a salad, with Tuna in it. It cost 19 dollars. Ordered a mango mojito. Lots of syrup with some mint.Here's the problem I have with the place. We got the living social deal, 50 dollars worth of food for 25 dollars, then proceeded to spend 11 dollars over the 50 on drinks and such.  61 dollars total. Although there is a sign up that says any dinner over 60 dollars will be comp'd parking, they refused to comp the parking because we bought the deal at living social. Instead, they offered to ""sell"" us a parking pass for a dollar off the garage price. When we bought the living social deal, we did so because they was a parking lot nearby and we heard they comp'd parking-important in congested hoboken. So, dining here cost us an additional 6 dollars.My problem isn't the money. This place, is NOTHING special. Its virtually the same menu of a dozen other faux trendy Hoboken places (Teak, Trinity, 10th and Willow, etc). Its even in a crappy part of town, far away from the path. There is NOTHING unique about the place.  Offering us parking, like the sign said, while yes, would have cost them a couple of dollars , would have left us feeling good about the place. Instead, it felt like we got nickel and dimed. Why would I come back here again? To have food I can have everywhere else while giving money to an establishment that clearly doesn't give a f*ck? This is why these restaurants fail. There are far better choices in Hoboken.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Some stalls even had toilet seat covers. This is a rarity on the East Coast and someone from California always giggles with delight at their sight. Additionally, they had something I'd never seen before. Their bathroom doors have a weird handle that requires threading your arm through it in order to pull. Isn't that cool?

The location is fine and they do have free parking within a reasonable walking distance.  The layout of the place is nice, although there is a bit of spillover noise from the bar area.  Given that it was Friday night, there was loud music and a number of people at the bar, although I will say that it was not so bad that it affected out meal/dinnertime conversations.The service was fine, albeit a bit slow.  The waiter forgot my friend's tea and they fumbled a great deal in removing our appetizers.  Which leads me to my next point: They had a really neat French Onion Soup Dumpling appetizer.  Basically, you get six dumplings filled with french onion soup and covered in Asiago cheese.  It was tasty, although a bit hard to eat since the shells were ready to explode from all the liquid and onions.  Unfortunately for my wife and my two friends, they ordered the classic Ceasar salad.  It was extremely plain, and tasted like wet lettuce covered in croutons and Parmesan.  My friend, fellow yelper and Ceasar salad aficionado, was not amused.  The entrees were also a let down.  The lobster risotto lacked flavor and was overall poorly done.  The hangar steak was bland and slightly over cooked.  I ordered the pan fried free range chicken.  The chicken was salty, the mashed potatoes came from a box and needed salt and pepper, and the spinach was fine.My wife got the ravioli of the week, which turned out to be a wild mushroom ravioli in a marinara sauce under mozzarella and basil.  This was delicious.  The marinara was complemented perfectly by the fresh basil and mozzarella.  The dish was surprisingly spicy, however my wife and I love spicy food so that was great.  The dessert was 50/50.  We had the molten chocolate cake, which I thought was very well done.  My friends shared the banana split, which had too many walnuts and mediocre ice cream.  All in all, if I found myself here again, I would try the ravioli of the week, and have that delicious molten chocolate cake.  I would definitely avoid the Ceasar .",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

276,6sISw3VSpOpMRIVB7cVHFQ,Rob C.,1.0 star rating,"I've never written a review before - but after this Friday, I needed to. Friday nights are quite possibly one of the most difficult nights to attempt to go out to eat in Hoboken. Regardless, four of my friends and I tried to get a table at a popular Mexican restaurant. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table and no possibility of one becoming available, we became annoyed and left. We called ahead to Madison to see if there was a table available for five and luckily they said they had one free and would hold it for us. Upon entering, we were told that we wouldn't be allowed to eat in the dining room because my friend had a beanie hat on (mind you, it's January.) We could eat if he took it off, but having not done anything with his hair, he didn't feel comfortable. Now the problem here is that in the dining room a woman was sitting in her sweat pants and enjoying her meal, while my friend was dressed quite nicely and had a beanie on (in winter!) So Madison Bar & Grill would rather make the business decision (in this economy) to lose out on five hungry and paying customers because one person had a beanie on. Certainly, my friend could have taken it off and we could've eaten. But the principle of the matter is unacceptable. If a hungry cancer patient appears in your restaurant with a hat on, will you turn them away? This is not 1950 and this is Hoboken, N.J. This is not well-to-do bar and grill, not in a well-to-do area and it is not serving up a fine dining, five-star experience. So, Madison Bar & Grill, because of your outdated, ignorant policy, you lost out on a check for five customers who've been to your establishment multiple times since moving to Hoboken. Not only did you lose out on that one sale, but we've all vowed to never go back. Congrats.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

The pasta had a funny taste, mushy noodles and looked as if it had been microwaved, and I felt the same way about the chicken as well. I cook stuffed chicken breasts myself and it's not possible to properly cook a piece a chicken that quickly, so it had to have been pre-prepared or microwaved as well.

When you order their regular entrees the prices go beyond what you get. They are still really good...I recall a tasty savory chicken stuffed with spinach bacon with a very savory sauce overtop.  When I compare cost to food quality, I think this is a top spot uptown.they used to have this scallop appetizer, I don't see it on the menu anymore.  It was amaizing.  Scallops seared with bits of diced bacon.  Served with rich mashed potatoes, all of this in this mini pot.  Place gets crowded on  the weekends, its a solid place for nightlife.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

This place seriously disappointed me in their service. First, the brunch area is by the bar. I told the hostess and she sat us in the dining area instead. We asked our waitress if we could sit by the brunch she got awkward and snippy telling us we were already seated and there were no open tables in the other room. Ok fine no big deal but it was awkward walking across the dining area back and forth between people to get to the buffet and then walk back looking like you just did the walk of shame because your plate is so full. And by the way there were several open tables on the buffet side but whatever. Ok I finally have my food yum but It was a project and a half to get our waitress' attention and honestly she looked high or drugged. She was so out of it. We asked for coffee refills and she was so spacy and confused. What's so confusing about coffee? Anyways we never saw her again until we got the check. It was just so uncomfortable speaking to her.

336,MvG3W0Qg94trx94bK9GldA,Navin R.,5.0 star rating,"The first time I went there I knew it was home.  Been there many, many times since, and since I live two blocks away rarely do I see the need anymore to put in the effort to go more than two blocks when I want food/drink.  Why this is a great place:1) Bartenders are friendly, down-to-earth, talk to you (when they can), remember your name, and treat you like a valued customer (you hear that City Bistro?).2) Food is very good (their ribeye w/creamed spinach is outstanding, as are their chicken dishes, oysters, and bar pizza and the complimentary bread with dinner is unique and tasty) and reasonably priced.  The ""first seating"" course menu until 7PM is downright cheap for what you get, and you have plenty of options to choose from.3) An extensive, creative, and tasty signature martini menu.  I'll drink four in a night, each one different.  Great wine list.  Have one of my favorite wines by the glass.4) Coat check in the winter.5) Good vibe - when the DJ starts on Fridays & Saturdays it's not too loud while people are still eating and they play good tunes.6) Good crowd - it's a mid-20's to early 40's crowd.  Great place if you're in your 30's like me.  Fun but not obnoxious.7) Good happy hour - goes until 8pm (but the specials are limited).8) Good bar size/stools to customer ratio (i.e. bar is not small for the size of the place).9) Outdoor seating in warm weather.10) It's a nice place without being pretentious.(11 - Great place for ladies to meet a tall, athletic, attractive, fun, single mid-30's male.  If you see one siting at the bar, stop and say hi.)",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Giving this low score for the super- creepy host ( skinny guy, 20's, blonde hair) who harassed my wife & me all night after we asked to sit in a different seat. Talked sh$t about us to the bartender, stared us down all night, intentionally bumped into me.  Too bad, because the service was always really friendly.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

First time ever going out to eat and drink in Hoboken. I usually never leave manhattan. I was pleased at the lower prices, for both food and drink. Madison has an awesome selection of gourmet/seasonal/high quality/fusional foods. I had the polynesian club sandwich (seared tuna, mango salsa, cabbage slaw). It came with sweet potato fries but I switched it in for truffle fries. I love truffle flavored anything. The fries were the BEST. The seared tuna club came on a stale-ish brioche bun. The ""slaw"" was really dry too. I ended up just eating the tuna with a fork since I was finishing my truffle fries (again, those are A+) and wanted that to be my main source of starch for the meal. My friend got the mushroom/chickpea burger and his fries were soooo hard and stale we had to take them back ( he got regular fries, not the think truffle ones). The truffle fries were thin, salty, crunchy (but moist in the middle), with truffle oil all over them!!!! I got 2 blue moons ($3 each) but the bartender only charged me for one (accidentally, I think...) which was awesome!!!!!! Seriously, id go back just for the truffle fries, low prices, and awesome ambience. It looks like a classy brunch place. Family friendly, too.",The Madison Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
