Came here with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night, 7:30pm no wait. I called ahead when they opened and was told for a party of 2 no need for a reservation -- they were right! When my friend arrived a few minutes before me, they tried to seat us by the door (on a very cold January night which we declined). The guy didn't seem to understand people have an aversion to the cold, seating close to other tables isn't a problem! Fast forward-- Our server seemed like management, and he was super friendly and attentive. This is definitely a family owned business, and it shows! We tried the octopus special with potatoes, the eggplant appetizer (heavy on the garlic in a good way), and shared the Finochiella pizza with fennel, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and sausage. We ended the meal with tasty cappuccinos (trying an alcohol free January; but this place is BYOB). Next time I'll try the pasta!Ps for everyone complaining about the paper napkins, they've changed to cloth!!",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
1,6axlCeIobYZwsaIKOLpYbA,Kristin A.,2.0 star rating,"I tried Panello for the first time on a Sunday night.  I had a reservation for 5 people at 5:30 pm which was good since there was a large party of 18 people coming at 6:00 pm which took up a lot of the seating.  Panello is off the beaten path in the Monroe Center so it's good they have a free parking lot for patrons.   I was very underwhelmed by the experience though and won't be making the trip back there anytime soon.  There are definitely more affordably priced BYO pizza spots in Hoboken (Napolis, Johnny Pepperoni, the Brick) that have bigger menus and better tasting food. When we got to the restaurant, the server immediately told us several main items that weren't available (crab cakes, lasagna, the special hangar steak, and a few more).   I was surprised to hear that the pizzas only came in a personal size - 12 inch pizza -  since the bulk of their pizzas were priced between $18 - $20 and that's very steep for a personal pie.  In addition, their pasta dishes ranged $18 - $22 and again, it was not a large portion for the cost.  They told us they had eggplant parmigiana as a special - when we asked if it came with a noodle, they said no - also surprising.  We tried the stuffed mussels and spiedini to start.  The stuffed mussels were underwhelming.  The spiedini was good. For dinner, three of us got personal pies and two got pasta dishes.  I ordered the special Burrata pizza pie ($19).   It looked and tasted identical to the Margarita pie someone else at the table ordered.  For $4 more, it wasn't worth it.   Tasted like average pizza.   Also, it was very hard to have a conversation at our table - since there was a very large party, it was very loud in the restaurant and the acoustics there are not good.    Overall, not worth the cost or the trip.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
2,dD-e4MWK3p5xUK9gcWpu9w,Emma P.,2.0 star rating,"I hate to have to give bad reviews especially when it's for somewhere I have previously liked but after my most recent experience at Panello I have to...My husband and I went there for dinner on Sunday night. I noticed that they now close at 9 on Sundays so we went there at 8 o'clock. There were only a few other tables occupied when we arrived but the server wanted to seat us at a small table right next to the door (in December!) and adjoining a large and somewhat loud table. This was the worst table in a less than half full restaurant, so of course we declined it and sat elsewhere. We ordered two pizzas and a bottle of San Pellegrino, the first pizza was a special and it was excellent (the only reason this review has two stars instead of one is because of this pizza!). Then the pizza guy came over with 'our' second pizza, but it wasn't the pizza we had ordered so he went off to make the correct pizza for us. Second pizza shows up - a white pizza with fresh tomatoes, arugula and Parma ham. We have had this many times before and it has always been good, this time it was highly disappointing - there was very little tomato, the arugula was well past its prime and the Parma ham consisted of a few scraps complete with inedible rind.But the bad pizza wasn't the worst of it - from 8.30 onwards we were made to feel very unwelcome. The staff clearly wanted to close early, they started cleaning around us, scraping metal chairs across the concrete floor and whisking away our condiments while we were still eating. The female owner kept walking past our table and glaring at us making a point of staring at our food to see how much we had left - so rude! I've worked in restaurants and I get it, it's a long day, but you should never treat customers like they are in the way. You chose to give us a table and take our order, You are advertised as being open until 9, which means that you take orders until 9 and treat customers like valued guests. We weren't loitering just trying to have dinner - we had finished by 8.50 when you are still technically open for another 10 minutes.  Our bill came to $61.00 (with tax and tip) for two pizzas and a bottle of water. Prices here used to be very reasonable but they have gradually crept up, and frankly due to the way that we were treated and the poorly executed second pizza I thought that this was very overpriced.I've dined here numerous times over the past couple of years and taken lots of people there to eat but after this expensive fiasco I won't be returning.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The biggest issue was the special that my boyfriend ordered. They had a bucatini carbonara which sounded very good. When we got it though it was the definition of a bad carbonara. It was pretty much just scrambled egg pasta and not very appetizing.

I would categorize the entire night as lacking any sort of flavor.We started with the beet & goat cheese salad and the frisée salad which were barely dressed but fine (actually they forgot dressing on my wife's but whatever it happens).  Then we had a capricciosa pizza which tasted like bland ricotta cheese on soggy bread. My wife ordered the oricchette with sausage and broccoli rabe - an institution at any Italian restaurant and it was just shockingly bad.  Shockingly. Bad. Over cooked floppy oricchette, medallion slices of sasauge (literally not even 1 links worth) and some broccoli rabe. I tasted it and I'm pretty sure it was just plain pasta. They claim there is olive oil but it was drown out by the water from the pasta that was not properly drained so collected at the bottom of the bowl like soup. Zero taste.We spied an affogato on the menu before we showed up. I love affogato and get it whenever available.  The meal was just so underwhelming in every course so far that we skipped dessert and left.  Not worth the ~$85 for two people which is surprising because the place had such good reviews.  Disappointing.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

It is crispy, light and airy. Their 700+ degree oven gets it there. You really get the taste of the tomatoes and the fresh mozzarella cheese with every bite. This is the way pizza is supposed to taste folks! Iggy, the owner, was very nice and a pleasure to speak with. He's from Italy, knows his stuff, and puts out a very high quality product. Tiramisu was light and moist, not dry like many places put out. I definitely will be returning to try some of their pastas and their other pizzas.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

It's really warm inside because of the brick oven so be prepared although it's awesome in the Winter time! The place is BYOB and there is a wine store next door that you can pick up beer and wine from! We ordered the salmon, it was well cooked an flavorful, the beet she goat cheese salad, hanger steak, and a pizza.The crust on the pizza was great as were the ingredients fresh. The salmon was well cooked but maybe a little under seasoned. The hanger steak came on a skewer which was surprising, I felt it was over cooked even at medium rare and didn't really have that much flavor despite the type of cut it was. Our waiter was pretty stellar and is knowledgeableabout wines and pairing with food. The prices you can't beat!

19,6es_04FrajEYVhuFv4Xpgw,Kristina P.,5.0 star rating,"My very Italian friend whose mother makes some of the best Italian food I've ever had in my life proclaimed that the spinach gnocchi with cheese sauce was the best potato gnocchi she's ever had. I nearly dropped my fork. My cacio e pepe with pancetta was equally delicious though the pasta was pretty sticky. The spaghetti stuck together in small clumps which is never ideal but it still tasted great. We were feeling bold and got the soppressata pizza as an appetizer. I had half the pie and was still hungry for my entree so I don't think these are ""dinner"" pizzas, if you know what I mean. It was delicious but the crust is so thin that it kinda lacked substance. If you're looking for a meal type of pizza you're better off at Napoli's or Johnny Peps. For dessert, our awesome waiter gave us a Nutella pizza on the house (it was a screw up from the kitchen) and it was soooo good, probably the best Nutella pizza I've had.

It is crispy, light and airy. Their 700+ degree oven gets it there. You really get the taste of the tomatoes and the fresh mozzarella cheese with every bite. This is the way pizza is supposed to taste folks! Iggy, the owner, was very nice and a pleasure to speak with. He's from Italy, knows his stuff, and puts out a very high quality product.

It's really warm inside because of the brick oven so be prepared although it's awesome in the Winter time! The place is BYOB and there is a wine store next door that you can pick up beer and wine from! We ordered the salmon, it was well cooked an flavorful, the beet she goat cheese salad, hanger steak, and a pizza.The crust on the pizza was great as were the ingredients fresh. The salmon was well cooked but maybe a little under seasoned. The hanger steak came on a skewer which was surprising, I felt it was over cooked even at medium rare and didn't really have that much flavor despite the type of cut it was. Our waiter was pretty stellar and is knowledgeableabout wines and pairing with food. The prices you can't beat!

I nearly dropped my fork. My cacio e pepe with pancetta was equally delicious though the pasta was pretty sticky. The spaghetti stuck together in small clumps which is never ideal but it still tasted great. We were feeling bold and got the soppressata pizza as an appetizer. I had half the pie and was still hungry for my entree so I don't think these are ""dinner"" pizzas, if you know what I mean. It was delicious but the crust is so thin that it kinda lacked substance. If you're looking for a meal type of pizza you're better off at Napoli's or Johnny Peps. For dessert, our awesome waiter gave us a Nutella pizza on the house (it was a screw up from the kitchen) and it was soooo good, probably the best Nutella pizza I've had.

41,s6TnINODnAwhHk0e_QXayg,Arshi K.,4.0 star rating,"Panello you have made me so happy! We had an outstanding meal here recently. When I reviewed them nine months ago they were merely a week old and doing a great job with their range of brick oven pizzas. Since then I've been back twice and here's an excellent example of a business that's actually listening to their customers. They listened and now have an expanded pasta and salad section as well.Each of their pastas are a lesson in Italian cooking. We had the Spinach gnocchi in pesto sauce and it has to be the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. The pesto sauce was rich, but not creamy, the texture of the pasta was just so perfect. And the ingredients so fresh that you could taste them in every bite. We also sampled the Diavolo Dolce (hot pizza) and it was so GOOD -- topped with calabrian chilies, olives, kale, drizzled honey, grated pecorino cheese and so much goodness! The crust was superbly crisp, charred in the right places...we couldn't stop eating it! To top it all, my friend and I shared the Tiramisu. Happy to report that this time round, the tiramisu was absolutely exquisite. It simply melted in our mouth and had the perfect combination of sweetness and hint of bitter coffee - faultless!  The portion size of the tiramisu has been reduced, but the consistency and taste has vastly improved - do try it.  Service at Panello has been a little erratic  last few times and wish they would resolve it... you will also be paying NYC prices in Hoboken, but the warmth of this restaurant and delicious food is worth it.

The waiter kept cursing and yelling at one of the other staff members but we kept thinking it was at us. They also put other people at our table which was fine - but they were on a date and I was just with my room mate so if anything it was probably more inconvenient for them. The waiter also never brought us bread and forgot to bring the couple we were basically on a double date with their water multiple times. We ordered pizza as an appetizer and it was good but very light and thin. Both of us ordered the gnocchi with four cheeses for dinner and it was AMAZING.

They removed the place settings, napkins and silverware from our table as if to assume we would use our hands as utensils and clothes as napkins?  And then the icing was watching the waitress literally dump the birthday cake on the table like it was on fire and refuse to let us use their plates and utensils (because we should have brought our own)!

All of them were delicious, the Beet appetizer was presented almost like a pate which was kind of cool goat cheese layers between layers of beet yummy. The Pizza dough was fresh and yummy, We tried the Margherita, Marinara and the Sausage/Mushroom. My only suggestion would be to maybe make the toppings a bit more manageable to eat??

57,16pTruEeLiNkutxwG8LDQA,Anupriya M.,3.0 star rating,"Panello was a unique experience. The food was decent- but not great. We ordered the caprese salad and eggplant for appetizers. The eggplant was very tasty but the caprese salad lacked taste. I think a house made balsamic glaze would slightly make up for that. Main: pesto pizza was okay. Being that most rave about the pizza id rather eat at grimaldis on Washington Pastas- Rigatoni Bolognese- 7/10, ravioli-8/10, house special lasagna- it was good but not for 19$. Service: I called the day before to make a reservation for 8 and a highchair- that makes 9 people. I confirmed this with them twice. They still didn't get it right. And when I told them I needed a chair when I got there the waiter told me he doesn't do reservations. It was kind of rude. Just fix the problem. Would I come back? I don't think so. It was an overall 6.5/10 experience. If your feeling adventurous and something not on Washington Ave and don't mind spending some $$$ go for it.

The salad was easily large enough to share, fresh greens, lemony and zesty, a sprinkle of fresh parmesan, very good. The wood-fired pizza has it all: great crust with perfect char, a tangy sauce and cheese topping.  The pizza is delicious, it's a medium size good enough for a 'light' dinner for two.  Prices are a little NYC high, yet I will pay extra to support a local business that focuses on quality and fresh ingredients.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Meatballs:  3 decent sized balls in tomato sauce with one small slice of focaccia.  They kindly offered us extra focaccia since we were sharing everything.  Lots of garlic and spices, not too salty, tomato sauce tasty but slightly, SLIGHTLY, on the watery side. Very good.2. Eggplant: Stuffed with bread crumbs and some other items we couldn't quite identify taste-wise.  Lots of garlic.  Served on a bed of mixed greens with light balsamic dressing.   Very good.3. Spinach tortellini in 4 cheese sauce with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Sauce = excellent. Pasta = packaged.  I know the pasta was packaged because I used to work at a restaurant nearby and we used the same exact pasta. Same size, texture, taste, everything. Delicious, though I wish they made their pasta from scratch.The con here is the pricing. They're just too expensive.  The little plates are kind of, well, little, considering the price.  If they shaved off $2-$5 for each then it would be the perfect value.  And BTW- adding cloth napkins would be a great classy addition! A thin white cheap paper napkin that soaks up oil after one use and essentially becomes useless means I need about 3-4 napkins for my meal.

It's brand new, so of course it's clean, and the decor is consistent with the going trend that I like to call ""quasi-hipster industrial."" I liked it. The massive pizza oven also keeps it toasty warm (it was a spring evening) but I can imagine it getting very warm in there come summertime. There are plenty of tables and you don't feel cramped at all.Bathroom: Nice and clean, well lit but not bright.Staff: We were seated even though we didn't have our full party with us (which I'm a fan of) and our waiter was a really nice guy. The (who I assume is) owner, an aging woman, worked every pizza and she was earning her pay - standing in front of that oven was making her sweat bullets! But knowing that she was giving each pie some love somehow made it that much better.Food: It's BYOB so luckily our friends brought a bottle of wine. We started with a salad and meatballs (both enjoyable) and then went right to the pizzas: Marinara w/ prosciutto (good, but the prosciutto was basically laid on top of the pizza like an after-thought), the special Diavolo Dolce pizza (hot but sweet, it was enjoyable), and another pie that basically looked like peperoni pizza (akak looked delicious!). For dessert we had the Neutella pizza which was very tasty.Value: All-in-all the prices are just so-so. The pizza is just so-so and I think the prices could be just a bit lower. However, you won't break your wallet giving this place a try.We had an enjoyable meal, mostly due to the company rather than the food. But this place is fine if you're looking for something different and are a fan of ""Hoboken-style pizza.""",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Coming from an italian who is stuck in her ways of only eating her grandmother and mother's meatballs, I have to say Panello had some great meatballs! Their sauce was also very good. For my entree I had the Cacio e Pepe which was also good. Pasta was cooked al dente, my fav. If you do not like chunks of black pepper I would not recommend this to you. It was more pepper than I had anticipated but was nothing to turn you off from the meal, considering you probably like pepper as it is a cheese and pepper pasta dish. My father had the gnocci which he also enjoyed and he agreed that the meatballs and sauce ""hit the spot"". Great place to go with friends and family.

Heavy on the pepper, light on the salt and not as wet as it should have been. Also they forgot the pancetta. Honestly, just very sub par.

The Spinich Gnocchi seemed stored bought.  Very Gummy with very little sauce.  I doubt it was 4 cheese.  Maybe they should take a few minutes to make homemade pasta instead.  It would not be diffucult.  Their Tiramasui was very tiny and not up to par.  The little rasberry sauce was actually good.  It was way overpriced for any quality or any value.  The other reviews must be fake.,Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Pizza was the best of the 3. These are more standard pasta sizes than the huge portions most places serve. I like my pasta cooked a bit more and with a heavy hand on the sauce. Could have used some extra. We ordered the gnocchi to compare it to the four cheese gnocchi from Leo's and it was no where close.

It looked an tasted amazing. Great presentation. Perfect appetizer. We followed that up with the Burrata cheese and gasped at the portion. It was huge! Lastly, we shared a meatball pizza. It was crisp, cooked to perfection. Delicious. The only thing that prevents us from giving Panello 5 stars was our first trip there. We arrived at 9:15 on a Friday night and were told they were no longer seating people. We couldn't believe that they wouldn't let us sit down 45 minutes before posted closing time. When we went back again this week, we asked our waiter about closing and he said we'd be seated any time before 10:00.

As most food establishments here have above average food and good service. The reasons for only 2 stars is1. It's overpriced for the quality and quantity you get. 15$ for some thin dough, a Lot of sauce and barely visible cheese (yes,  pizza).  9$ for 3 small Meatballs?  Seriously? Goat cheese and beets salad was good. But in no way even close to be worth 12$. There's no real imagination there,  just beets and goat cheese. 2.

He didn't tell us we have to pick a sauce too as on the menu there was a heading with different sauces and we thought the sauce is always on the pizza why add more sauce. It was the waiters duty to let us know which he didn't. When the pizza came after a long wait it was burned on the sides and no sauce on it. We were shocked to see the pizza and of course without sauce it was tasteless. We asked for sauce and the waiter gave us a small tiny bowl of sauce that too after a long wait. There were garlic and crushed pepper bottles on other tables but non on ours. We again asked the waiter to gave us the bottles and again he gave it to us at least after 10 minutes wait time.

If you've been to Italy and are yearning for that authentic flavor, try this place out.

There were pieces of dried fruid, a nice vinaigrette, and pieces of apple on the side. I would imagine there is a better way to garnish a salad than by quartering an apple and placing it on the side of the plate, but whatever - tasted good.We got two pizzas - the margherita and a white pizza w/ mushrooms, artichoke, sopressata... very good, and the perfect size. For two people, the salad and two pizzas were just the right amount of food. You'll either finish it all (if you are starving), or have a few slices leftover for breakfast the next day.I will say that the layout/design of the restaurant wasn't my favorite. Very plain decor (which I don't necessarily dislike), but with large ceilings and fairly bright lighting, it looks more like there just wasn't a lot of thought put into it. As others have noted, they serve with paper napkins which is just not ideal when eating something with a lot of oil/flour (pizza) with your hands (pizza). A cloth napkin could stand the test of the meal much better!All said, I definitely will return.

Not that these things (or extra cheese) are bad; they're just not within the scope of what this place appears to be trying to achieve.  That works for me, but may not for you.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The only thing I would have liked differently was if they specified on the menu that it came with walnuts on top as I am allergic. It was ok though, my boyfriend took them off and I ate the parts that weren't touching the nuts. The orange vinaigrette was AMAZING!For dinner we split the Capricciosa pizza. It had mozzarella, marinated artichokes, and sopressata. It was delicious. Lastly, I had a cappuccino and he had a double espresso and I destroyed the tiramisu.Everything was great. The staff was very friendly and I loved the fact that you could see them making the pizza as you ordered it. The best part was the price. Pizza, salad, dessert and coffee - less than $50.

We then split the Capricciosa, which is fior di latte, marinated artichoke hearts, mushrooms, sopressata and pecorino romano. The crust was so thin it was perfect!

141,dhKGMu318fc0v5pbeAGv5g,John S.,2.0 star rating,"Have been to Panello twice now and was especially disappointed on my second visit. The restaurant is sufficiently staffed and the waiters are courteous so no complaints with the service.  Food, however, is mediocre and I'm being kind. Recently visited with two friends who had come down to visit from Tenafly. We ordered the Marinara pizza, kale salad and gnocchi with the intent of ordering more as the meal progressed. The pizza arrives in under 5 minutes--a bit too quickly. The crust was crispy and tasty but it was overwhelmed with tomato sauce. There couldn't have been more than a teaspoon of percorino romano. We were expecting it to be freshly shaved but instead it was grated and sprinkled sparingly. You eat with your eyes first and this just didn't look appetizing. The kale salad was unimaginative. The leaves were huge and had to be cut with a knife and the dressing was blah. You can whip up something similar at home in just a couple of minutes. I could see my friends were disappointed and we pinned our collective hopes on the four-cheese gnocchi. Alas, it arrived luke warm, a cardinal sin for pasta. The portion was tiny--pretty stingy for a $16 dish. Taste? The gorgonzola completely overwhelmed the other cheeses. Trying to somehow salvage the meal we ordered the mussels but they were out. At this point, we decided to cut our losses and left a bit hungry. If you want to see how this kind of restaurant should be executed, try Razza in Jersey City It's a shame because Panello is a lovely space and the workers are trying. I just wonder who's getting a final look at the plates before they go out. Whoever it is, they dropped the ball ... at least in our case. No one wants to wait too long for food but when it arrives too quickly as our pizza did, you get suspicious. Also, if you're serving tiny portions, the dish better be dazzling.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

150,pGz4WhVQ90PC9BSe7n7s-g,Janina O.,4.0 star rating,"Went here for late dinner on a Friday night. My boyfriend and I have a standard order when we try a new brick oven pizza place - Margherita pie, side of meatballs, and salad. The meatballs were amazing. And their red sauce is spot-on. We decided to skip the margherita because the special pie sounded so great - ricotta, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. No regrets! Both cheeses and the pesto tasted super fresh and homemade.. The crust was just how it should be. As for the dropped star, the arugula salad really left something to be desired. It wasn't dressed well and was just kind of boring (I expect at least a decent vinaigrette when everything else is that good). However, the table next to us had a really nice looking burrata salad, which I think was a special. Service was a bit slow (considering we were 1 of 4 tables dining), but that's to be expected for a new restaurant. Looking forward to going back for some more meatballs and maybe next time I'll satisfy my green fix with their broccoli rabe pie ;)",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

155,wacEdlA25P5Kpxo__Gq6Yg,joe d.,1.0 star rating,"Last night was my second try at this place and unfortunately, my experience was no better, if not worse than my first. The food is over priced for Hoboken and the portions are way too small. I'm not a real big eater, but I left hungry and had to eat an hour later because I was starving. The atmosphere could be nice if the seating arrangements were better. If you're a couple, you are forced to sit with complete strangers. There are no tables for two which I find to be utterly ridiculous.The first time I went, we were four and I felt bad for the couple at our table who had to hear us talking about stuff that was of no interest to them. Last night we were two and had to sit at a table with four strangers and honestly, everyone was uncomfortable.I had the pizza last night and it was completely underwhelming and over priced. what amounted to a personal size pizza was really not worth the price at all and it was cooked just so so. Had meatballs and while they may have been ok, 9 bucks for three little meatballs just wasn't worth it. They weren't so special.So since they obviously want to cater to groups and the kindergarten brigade, I'm done with this place.",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Frieda, the owner was a pleasure to deal with and beyond attentive from the beginning. The staff were on top of their game for the whole party, and the food speaks for itself from all the rave reviews. They accommodated many guest requests on the spot including gluten free eggplant appetizers and pizza without cheese for one who was lactose intolerant. Many people at our party said the pizza was the best they have ever had, and since the place is so rustic and beautiful my photos on Instagram and Facebook drew attention with people asking me about the restaurant. My only complaint (and I am sure everyone has at least one when planning a party) was that the cake slices were cut extremely thin. I had 39 guests in total and splurged on a cake that feeds 50-60 and a few people mentioned after the fact that they loved the cake and assumed the slices were so small because it wasn't big enough! Not sure why that happened, but perhaps I hold some responsibility in making sure the slices were appropriate?? Either way, it was a most memorable day (and their outside seating is quite special as well) and we will definitely be back for dinner. And....it's BYOB!",Panello,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
