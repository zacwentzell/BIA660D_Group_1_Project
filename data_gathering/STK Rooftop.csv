We arrived at 6:15pm and as we walked up to the host stand to check in the two male hosts that we're there didn't have their shit together and the smell grew worse.Finally one of the hosts asked us, can I help you and we checked in. I asked what is that horrible smell of molded cheese is there a way we can eat upstairs.  And he says to us, its two different restaurants and if you go upstairs you have to cancel down here first. And there is no guarantee there is availability upstairs. So my girlfriend said, well its 6:18pm its not 6:30pm so we still have time to come back down.He didn't look happy..So we head upstairs and see the host and I said what is that Horrible Smell downstairs and he says I have no idea, I'm used to horrible smells...Second sign we should of walked out...He sits us and we wait for the waitress to come to our table.The waitress comes to our table and she tells us the specials and we asked if there is anyway possible if we can get one of the items that are downstairs (I.E. Broccoli) she says unfortunately, No, because its not an item we stock up here... BTW, who doesn't stock broccoli at a steak place.... WTF???Third sign we should of walked out...  But because I was hungry,  I let it go...So we placed our order:1. ) Grilled watermelon salad  (APP)2. ) One 16 oz steak (Medium Rare) that we we're going to split.3.) Asparagus4.) Mushrooms (Ordered this since there was no BroccoliThe Watermelon App comes out and its just Ok...Now when your at a decent restaurant especially steak houses they ALWAYS offer you some type of bread of some sort...No bread ever came out...  But a couple two tables down from us had gotten bread...So I call the waitress back over and said Hi, can we get some bread and she says, yeah we don't have any bread up here. I said well that couple got bread... She says, yeah I don't know how they got that, sorry...Fourth sign we should of walked out...So after 25 minutes the steak and veggies finally arrives.. And the steak is OVER COOKED!!!!FML!!!!We call the waitress back over and said this is completely over cooked and she says yes it is, let me fix that for you. And I say how long will that be? Because our sides are going to get cold.She says let me find out...She comes back to the table and says, its gonna be ANOTHER 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. Fifth sign and NOW IM FURIOUS.....I said that's it, I had enough where is the manager...The female manager comes over and says what can I help you with? I said well we waited a long time for our food and now our steak came out over cooked and now we're stuck eating cold veggies. She says, well its gonna take another 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. I said that is unacceptable... She says well there is nothing I can do... What can I do to make this a better experience?I said at this point nothing, because we are both starving and we don't really want to wait any longer...She says Im sorry, there is nothing I can do we are really busy...  Now you would think she would of said I will make sure they cook your ASAP. She didn't...So I just said you know what just bring the check for what is here...SHE CHARGED US FOR SPARKLING WATER, WATERMELON SALAD, COLD ASPARAGUS' AND COLD MUSHROOMS...So much for doing the right thing...

11,sg6QUs9ycjbUUklhB6wxhA,Tom M.,2.0 star rating,"This was the worst steakhouse experience we've ever had. The restaurant came as a suggestion by American Express and our friends in the city said it's a great rooftop restaurant. We arrive promptly for our dinner reservation, and the 3 young girls at the hostess counter were standing around and giving us no indication when we'd be seated after I gave them the last name. After 10 minutes of standing there not knowing what's going on, I have to ask if we're going to be seated and they then asked for our name again so they could pull up the reservation. They then scramble around and finally seat us. Not the best way to start dinner. The view was amazing and we could definitely tell why this place is popular. However, we couldn't hear one another speak at our table due to a speaker that was 10 feet behind us and blasting dance music for the entire restaurant. They have a very nice audio set up with speakers placed around the restaurant, but were not using them for some reason. Instead it was a small speaker set on the ground that looked to be hooked up to an iPod and was billowing loud dance music. Don't get me wrong, it'd be fun and the music was good if it were a day party and everyone was standing around. Not when it's the dinner hour and you are wanting to catch up with old friends over dinner. After asking our server if the speaker can be turned in another direction or turned down, she said she'd ask Management. 15 minutes go by and nothing has changed so I go to the hostess where I was again ignored until I asked to be helped. She had an absolutely disgusted look on her face when I asked for help and went over to the speaker and turned it away from us. She threw her hands up with frustration, rolled her eyes at us and went back over to the hostess table. We then got our food, which I would say was just okay. Our steaks were luke warm at best, but at least our sides were nice and hot. $750 later, we paid our bill and were leaving. As we walked by the girl at the hostess counter again (I think she may have actually been the manager) we stand there waiting for the elevator and she never once looked up at us or said ""hey, thanks for coming in."" Nothing. This place is managed by young, entitled twits, and the only reason for not getting 1 star is the wine and good sides.",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Though we felt out of place we just decided to stay there. We put our name down for a table and were seated after about an hour, when she said our table would be ready in 25-30 min. (It almost felt as if she forgot to seat us). In the meantime, we enjoyed cocktails ($17)  and glasses of wine ($13-14) which were good, but pricey for college students. When we were seated, we ordered the seared tuna, truffle fries, and a half dozen oysters. I'm not a big fan of oysters, so I didn't enjoy those, but the tuna and fries were excellent! The fries were so good that we ordered another along with a steak. The steak was also very juicy and good except it was so windy that day that it got cold quickly. Overall, we made it work because it was my friend's birthday, but the rooftop is meant for older, working professionals.

It was too wet. Therefore making me sick. There was also a light fixture that missed falling on my head by 5 inches. Not one staff member check to see if we were ok. My only other complaint that was my date was a rather big guy ( size of a pro footballer ) and the seat we were given I couldn't even get out of without disrupting the other diners. This is important. Very important. Please note we were sitting on the roof. Otherwise everything was fine.

Kudos to him. Our waited would disappear for long periods of time, and ignore us. The couple dining next to us ordered two bottles of champagne, so I suppose they ""deserved"" more attention. The truffle fries are bleh. They're big thick rectangles that are not crispy enough and the truffle flavor was negligible. The lobster mac n cheese was actually incredibly and surprisingly good and a pretty big portion. The kale salad here is amazing and I would come back for it. Yes, that's how good it was. I know how insane that sounds. All in all, too snotty and pricey for me. Great for people watching and the kale salad. Also - the stairs and elevator up to here smell like pee.

I've been to all STK locations around the United States and still STK downtown has been one of my favorite location of the One Group! My second favorite location is STK Miami.This evening my entire opinion of STK has completely changed. I had ignored all the telling signs throughout the years because I was a big fan of their food . Regardless , they were never known for their service. They were known for their trendy atmosphere and fantastic food . That trendy atmosphere that once graced STK downtown has become stale. Their food can't carry for their waitstaff short comings ! Every year on the day I was born , which is typically called your birthday. For the past 5 years, I would celebrate my birthday at STK . I would have a wonderful dinner with my party followed by real conversation that will end with a candle & dessert! No singing !!! That is just too embarrassing ! Every year, my party would make a reservations at STK. They will always instruct the reservationist that they would like a candle with desserts because they are celebrating a birthday and to keep it quietly since it's a surprise .Every year, STK would provide a candle in my dessert! That candle had symbolized the day I was born, my birthday!  Candle marked the day for me ! Last year , my mother had pass away . Thus , I mourned for the entire year which I did not celebrate my birthday nor any holiday . It's already hard enough missing the one person you would like to be there , but can't be their physically only in spirit.My party and I waited for the desserts to be brought out!  We waited about 22 minutes for STK waiter to bring out my dessert. Once they did , we realized something was missing !!! There was  no candle on the desert to mark my birthday!!' I was terribly upset and very disappointed that I personally brought it to the managers attention! It was just another ordinary dinner!!!  How  is this different than any other dinner ? This is my birthday dinner!  It need to be different,  we need to mark the occasion !! We were than told by the manager , he will be right back ! A woman then approached the table & stated to us that unfortunately they do not take reservations in house so they do not know who we spoke to at STK reservations off site. Than  they took off my $12 dessert! Her attitude was very nonchalant , like oh well . Listen I'm not looking for a free meal people ! I'm the CEO for a major global beauty brand. Every year I share my birthday with my family, friends at STK . STK & The One Group robbed me of my birthday celebrations this year 2017 ! They couldn't even acknowledge their responsibility for screwing things up. Than they had the audacity to push it back on us.. How stupid you think my party is ? We do this every single year! My party knows how important my birthday is especially not being able to celebrate it last year! Listen I understand things happen in life!  I get it, but I'm a paying customer requesting a service , and yet I did not receive said services! I feel robbed! Instead of enjoying my birthday evening I am forced to write reviews on a business that did not acknowledge or take any accountability on their mistake . A simply I'm sorry would of been suffice , but instead they tried to pass fault to a third party that is employed by STK and the One Group.  Also , what happen to coat check in this establishment ? Where do you expect me to put my Dsquared fur coat ? It weights a ton , its white plus an inconvenience for me",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Our waiter was far enough to not stand over us but close enough that we can get her attention at any time we needed her.Its definitely an overpriced restaurant (which we knew before making a reservation) but you definitely do not get your money's worth !!!!!Our waiter had suggested a special appetizer which we agreed to & it was literally a thin slab of what seemed like pepperoni with some yellow & red peppers. I had ordered what was on special for the day which was a fish, that came with some mussels, rice & steamed spinach. I had ordered an extra side of steamed spinach cause everything seemed so small. My extra side order seemed very soggy. After a few bites, i could not fathom to finish it. The drinks are wayyyyy too overpriced for the size of the glass so we ended up ordering some corona beers.To be clear, money is not the issue!

So my girlfriend said, well its 6:18pm its not 6:30pm so we still have time to come back down.He didn't look happy..So we head upstairs and see the host and I said what is that Horrible Smell downstairs and he says I have no idea, I'm used to horrible smells...Second sign we should of walked out...He sits us and we wait for the waitress to come to our table.The waitress comes to our table and she tells us the specials and we asked if there is anyway possible if we can get one of the items that are downstairs (I.E. Broccoli) she says unfortunately, No, because its not an item we stock up here... BTW, who doesn't stock broccoli at a steak place.... WTF???Third sign we should of walked out...  But because I was hungry,  I let it go...So we placed our order:1. ) Grilled watermelon salad  (APP)2. ) One 16 oz steak (Medium Rare) that we we're going to split.3.) Asparagus4.) Mushrooms (Ordered this since there was no BroccoliThe Watermelon App comes out and its just Ok...Now when your at a decent restaurant especially steak houses they ALWAYS offer you some type of bread of some sort...No bread ever came out...  But a couple two tables down from us had gotten bread...So I call the waitress back over and said Hi, can we get some bread and she says, yeah we don't have any bread up here. I said well that couple got bread... She says, yeah I don't know how they got that, sorry...Fourth sign we should of walked out...So after 25 minutes the steak and veggies finally arrives.. And the steak is OVER COOKED!!!!FML!!!!We call the waitress back over and said this is completely over cooked and she says yes it is, let me fix that for you. And I say how long will that be? Because our sides are going to get cold.She says let me find out...She comes back to the table and says, its gonna be ANOTHER 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. Fifth sign and NOW IM FURIOUS.....I said that's it, I had enough where is the manager...The female manager comes over and says what can I help you with? I said well we waited a long time for our food and now our steak came out over cooked and now we're stuck eating cold veggies. She says, well its gonna take another 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. I said that is unacceptable... She says well there is nothing I can do... What can I do to make this a better experience?I said at this point nothing, because we are both starving and we don't really want to wait any longer...She says Im sorry, there is nothing I can do we are really busy...  Now you would think she would of said I will make sure they cook your ASAP. She didn't...So I just said you know what just bring the check for what is here...SHE CHARGED US FOR SPARKLING WATER, WATERMELON SALAD, COLD ASPARAGUS' AND COLD MUSHROOMS...So much for doing the right thing... Total BS!!!!P.S. If anyone from STK's media relations department reads this, here is a tip...Know who your hiring...

The restaurant came as a suggestion by American Express and our friends in the city said it's a great rooftop restaurant. We arrive promptly for our dinner reservation, and the 3 young girls at the hostess counter were standing around and giving us no indication when we'd be seated after I gave them the last name. After 10 minutes of standing there not knowing what's going on, I have to ask if we're going to be seated and they then asked for our name again so they could pull up the reservation. They then scramble around and finally seat us. Not the best way to start dinner. The view was amazing and we could definitely tell why this place is popular. However, we couldn't hear one another speak at our table due to a speaker that was 10 feet behind us and blasting dance music for the entire restaurant. They have a very nice audio set up with speakers placed around the restaurant, but were not using them for some reason. Instead it was a small speaker set on the ground that looked to be hooked up to an iPod and was billowing loud dance music. Don't get me wrong, it'd be fun and the music was good if it were a day party and everyone was standing around. Not when it's the dinner hour and you are wanting to catch up with old friends over dinner. After asking our server if the speaker can be turned in another direction or turned down, she said she'd ask Management. 15 minutes go by and nothing has changed so I go to the hostess where I was again ignored until I asked to be helped. She had an absolutely disgusted look on her face when I asked for help and went over to the speaker and turned it away from us. She threw her hands up with frustration, rolled her eyes at us and went back over to the hostess table. We then got our food, which I would say was just okay. Our steaks were luke warm at best, but at least our sides were nice and hot. $750 later, we paid our bill and were leaving. As we walked by the girl at the hostess counter again (I think she may have actually been the manager) we stand there waiting for the elevator and she never once looked up at us or said ""hey, thanks for coming in."" Nothing. This place is managed by young, entitled twits, and the only reason for not getting 1 star is the wine and good sides.",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Though we felt out of place we just decided to stay there. We put our name down for a table and were seated after about an hour, when she said our table would be ready in 25-30 min. (It almost felt as if she forgot to seat us). In the meantime, we enjoyed cocktails ($17)  and glasses of wine ($13-14) which were good, but pricey for college students. When we were seated, we ordered the seared tuna, truffle fries, and a half dozen oysters. I'm not a big fan of oysters, so I didn't enjoy those, but the tuna and fries were excellent! The fries were so good that we ordered another along with a steak. The steak was also very juicy and good except it was so windy that day that it got cold quickly. Overall, we made it work because it was my friend's birthday, but the rooftop is meant for older, working professionals.

The truffle fries are bleh. They're big thick rectangles that are not crispy enough and the truffle flavor was negligible. The lobster mac n cheese was actually incredibly and surprisingly good and a pretty big portion. The kale salad here is amazing and I would come back for it. Yes, that's how good it was.

I've been to all STK locations around the United States and still STK downtown has been one of my favorite location of the One Group! My second favorite location is STK Miami.This evening my entire opinion of STK has completely changed. I had ignored all the telling signs throughout the years because I was a big fan of their food . Regardless , they were never known for their service. They were known for their trendy atmosphere and fantastic food . That trendy atmosphere that once graced STK downtown has become stale. Their food can't carry for their waitstaff short comings ! Every year on the day I was born , which is typically called your birthday. For the past 5 years, I would celebrate my birthday at STK . I would have a wonderful dinner with my party followed by real conversation that will end with a candle & dessert! No singing !!! That is just too embarrassing ! Every year, my party would make a reservations at STK. They will always instruct the reservationist that they would like a candle with desserts because they are celebrating a birthday and to keep it quietly since it's a surprise .Every year, STK would provide a candle in my dessert! That candle had symbolized the day I was born, my birthday!  Candle marked the day for me ! Last year , my mother had pass away . Thus , I mourned for the entire year which I did not celebrate my birthday nor any holiday . It's already hard enough missing the one person you would like to be there , but can't be their physically only in spirit.My party and I waited for the desserts to be brought out!  We waited about 22 minutes for STK waiter to bring out my dessert. Once they did , we realized something was missing !!! There was  no candle on the desert to mark my birthday!!' I was terribly upset and very disappointed that I personally brought it to the managers attention! It was just another ordinary dinner!!!  How  is this different than any other dinner ? This is my birthday dinner!  It need to be different,  we need to mark the occasion !! We were than told by the manager , he will be right back ! A woman then approached the table & stated to us that unfortunately they do not take reservations in house so they do not know who we spoke to at STK reservations off site. Than  they took off my $12 dessert! Her attitude was very nonchalant , like oh well . Listen I'm not looking for a free meal people ! I'm the CEO for a major global beauty brand. Every year I share my birthday with my family, friends at STK . STK & The One Group robbed me of my birthday celebrations this year 2017 ! They couldn't even acknowledge their responsibility for screwing things up. Than they had the audacity to push it back on us.. How stupid you think my party is ? We do this every single year! My party knows how important my birthday is especially not being able to celebrate it last year! Listen I understand things happen in life!  I get it, but I'm a paying customer requesting a service , and yet I did not receive said services! I feel robbed! Instead of enjoying my birthday evening I am forced to write reviews on a business that did not acknowledge or take any accountability on their mistake . A simply I'm sorry would of been suffice , but instead they tried to pass fault to a third party that is employed by STK and the One Group.  Also , what happen to coat check in this establishment ? Where do you expect me to put my Dsquared fur coat ? It weights a ton , its white plus an inconvenience for me",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Staff were super friendly & courteous. Our waiter was far enough to not stand over us but close enough that we can get her attention at any time we needed her.Its definitely an overpriced restaurant (which we knew before making a reservation) but you definitely do not get your money's worth !!!!!Our waiter had suggested a special appetizer which we agreed to & it was literally a thin slab of what seemed like pepperoni with some yellow & red peppers. I had ordered what was on special for the day which was a fish, that came with some mussels, rice & steamed spinach. I had ordered an extra side of steamed spinach cause everything seemed so small. My extra side order seemed very soggy. After a few bites, i could not fathom to finish it. The drinks are wayyyyy too overpriced for the size of the glass so we ended up ordering some corona beers.To be clear, money is not the issue!

There was a very busy bar scene, tables filled with families and bridge and tunnel people. The crowd fit my demo well, 40+.Service *** Our party of four was greeted warmly and sat promptly by the hostess. Something was off with our waiter, very nice but he seemed overwhelmed and disappeared for long stretches. We had to catch a train (aforementioned bridge and tunnel people) and it took myself, the hostess and a manager to find our waiter on the opposite side of the restaurant.Food ***** As with most steakhouses the menu is limited and I believe there was only one fish item on it but hey we are here for steak. We started with very good appetizers of Crispy Rock Shrimp and Tuna Tartare over Avocado with Root Chips. Our wives both ordered the Halibut special and was described as very good. I ordered the Strip and a table mate ordered the Bone In Filet, both ordered Medium. These steaks while slightly under seasoned for my taste were everything I could hope for, perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. Excellent sides of Mac & Cheese and Truffle Fries complimented the steaks well.Value *** Our drinks hovered around $14, appetizers $19, fish special $40, bone in filet $59, the strip $47 and the sides were $13. All in $415 before tip, gulp, but it is a NYC Steakhouse and unfortunately that is the norm.

The ambiance was great, rooftop, nice music all night (mix of top 40 and some oldies), and a great crowd. Young, professional, attractive crowd. We had a drink while we waited to be seated and the venue was great. Appetizers: Tuna Tartare & Grilled Octopus - Both appetizers were very average. I wasn't wow'd by any of the dishes to be honest. I have had some great grilled octopus with amazing flavors (Casa Apicii - NYC) so STK didn't really bring the wow factor. Entree: As this is a steak house I ordered the Filet 10 oz and it was cooked to perfection. Taste was amazing. I had some chimichurri on the side, but it definitely wasn't needed for the steak (sign of a great steak). Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese - this was a special for the night and it was AMAZING. I will always order Lobster Mac & Cheese when available! Parmesan Truffle Fries - Though the smell of these fries and description seemed amazing, I think they definitely fell short.

With yesterday being the Pride Parade, members of my family were late to the restaurant as was everyone else who had reservations. The hostess would not seat us at our table until our whole party was present. At that time we waited 30 mins before I asked again. I would also like to point out that the restaurant can seat 100+ and that there was literally 4 other people there at the time. After asking for the manager and telling him that we  would like to sit at our table and order drinks and an appetizer he said that""we can't do that because our chefs like everything to be ordered at once"" to which I replied there is literally  o one here that is bullshit. He obviously caved and seated us, but seated is right by the kitchen doors in the back of the restaurant (again keep in mind there is still no one there). The food was fine and the waiter was nice despite making an honest mistake. However, another family at the table next to ours was treated the same way as we were. They would not be seated until there whole party was there while the restaurant was still pretty empty. The female bathrooms were also extremely disgusting with trash all over floors and no toilet paper in any of the stalls. The floors were extremely sticky in both the hallways and the main floor and even in the ""lounge area"". It seems as though the staff didn't clean up from the night before and it was easily visible.After all of this I spoke to the manager again and explained all of our issues with him and said that everything could easily have been avoided and fixed. And still the place was less than half full.

We ordered the blue iceberg salad, Parmesan truffle fries, and a medium sirloin steak. The salad came as the actual iceberg lettuce cut in half. It was really good! The Parmesan truffle fries were hot and crispy and also really good! The disappoint was the steak--which is why we came to a steakhouse. We asked for medium rare and got a medium to medium well steak. It was super salty also. Glad we got the STK sauce with the steak because it helped with the chewiness and the fries (which are thick cuts of potatoes) helped balance the saltiness. Our waiter had so much knowledge about wine which was really nice. He helped us choose which wines would pair nicely with different cuts of steak while keeping in mine our preferences. I don't think it's the BEST steakhouse but worth going with a visitor in town or for a date for the ambiance/aesthetic.",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

The night of, the staff was so unorganized that they sent us to the wrong lounge on the third floor. (Apparently there are three different locations for parties-  the rooftop, the third floor and the basement.) I thought our tickets were for the rooftop and was then informed that they were for the basement, which had a long line that was few doors down from where we were. So we get to that line only to realize that these frauds oversold tickets and were no longer letting people in due to high capacity. Obviously there was no refund so we were just screwed.

We had to flag him down.  He seemed out of it and was completely loud and crazy. Actually, I'm going to go with drunk, based on the fact him and the ""manager"" were passing out horrible free shots and taking shots with customers. We constantly had to keep asking for water refill. When our food was delivered, one of the Steaks was not cooked correctly. After finally flagging down help, we were able to send it back to the kitchen. It was getting cold, at that point. They obviously just threw it on the grill again and burnt the crap out of it, than redelivered it. Ridiculous and not edible. They got really annoyed at us asking for the correction. The food was definitely not up to par, and service was horrible. The staff seemed to enjoy partying on the job more than pleasing their guests.

64,f7WfHOPnRUuTt8IvZvFWzg,Jonathan Z.,2.0 star rating,"We arrived earlier than our reservation, so we sat at the bar on the main level and had some amazing cocktails and had a great conversation with our bartender. She was exceptionally knowledgeable about drinks, edit them slightly to our taste, and was just all-around fun. We go upstairs to the rooftop for dinner and that's where things start to go wrong. I order The Château Briand which is steak and lobster and I'm told that it also comes with bone marrow and caviar. The busser  was very nice but did not pay close attention, he refilled my half full glass of sparkling water with flat, and while clearing our plates whipped a plate around quickly causing a fork to go flying and hit me. After an hour after ordering, I noticed other tables that were seated/ordered after us are already getting their food. There are several open tables, so it's not like they were exceptionally busy, but I'm getting more annoyed after an hour we still don't have our food. I eventually resigned that they had forgotten about us and get up to leave when the server comes rushing over. I tell her it's been over an hour since we ordered, she says to give her one minute and rushes to the back. A minute later she comes out with our food,  however it is stone cold; she had simply forgotten about us. I'm annoyed, however the food does look good so we continue to eat when I noticed that I don't have caviar. I asked the server where the caviar is and she says oh it's put on top of the lobster. This peaks my interest as that's not what she's told me when I was ordering and caviar is raw fish eggs so it should not have been cooked. I go to the front  desk and ask them to confirm what the special is and they say no there's no caviar, but crushed/mashed fish foam(?) of some type on top of the lobster. Now this would be fine if that's what they told me the meal included, however I was paying over $160 for my meal alone and I was expecting caviar. By the end, I'm just thoroughly disappointed and as were leaving the super sweet women at the front ask us how everything went; they can tell from my face how things went. They immediately ask what's wrong and I tell them and they try and make it right by offering us free drinks, however by this point I just wanted to leave. It was interesting to me that they even commented that they thought we were ""a sure thing"" for a good night because we came in in such high spirits; we really were having such a great night and it's sad that this really let me down.

Again, she claimed she was too busy to help me. I let her know all she needed to do was pass my drinks to me from the window. I mean seriously...are you that freaking busy that you can't even pass along drinks for 1 minute that had already been paid for.  And while I was at the bar, my friends noticed that Asha was wasn't too busy to help patrons who sat down after us but never came to the table to ask if they would like anything. I eventually had to ask for a manager because she also gave our shots away and we had to get them replaced.  The manager was very accommodating (paid for our next round) and gave us our own personal server, the Fabulous Gabriella, and we ended up having a wonderful time despite the blatantly disrespectful Asha who was discriminatory towards the African American patrons.  So I would have given them 4 stars but Asha's BS unprofessionalism demoted the Service 1 Star.",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

It is a second-rate restaurant trying really hard to make you feel as if you're in a first-rate restaurant, and you will pay the first rate prices, believe that. They have attitudes and weird little things that I'm sure impress people that don't know top service but it looks ridiculous if you have been to a place or two with real fantastic food and service. Here's a few examples: me and my partner arrived early and there was literally 90% of the tables open, they had us waiting for about 5 minutes to sit us down and they were letting people pile in the lobby upstairs in the Rooftop, the same way you have to wait in exclusive places for a table when it's packed. Once we sit down the waitress proceeds to explain the menu which really much amounted to her reading out loud what was printed on the menu. It was actually cringy to see. Then the waitress said that they were the only place in New York that serves kobe beef lol. Cocktails were OK not great, they have a really really limited selection of drinks. The DJ was playing really bad music but hey there's a DJ so it must be cool.",STK Rooftop,2.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"
