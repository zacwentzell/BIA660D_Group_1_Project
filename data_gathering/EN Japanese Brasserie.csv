Everything was so cutesy, creative, and unique, from the interior design to the dishes. The service was impeccable and friendly. Fried Oyster- 5/5 This was delicious! They cut it up 1 oyster into 4 pieces so it was easy to eat. Topping and sauce was delicious. Freshly Made Scooped Tofu ($11)-3.5/5 Fresh made tofu, definitely something I haven't tried, albeit I'm not a huge fan of tofu. They have an option of warm or cold, and we went with the warm one and added the wari-joyu and it tasted pretty good. I suggest adding more of this because it really enhances the flavor. Saikyo Miso Black Cod ($26)- 3.5/5 Two big portions of black cod, nicely cooked. However, it tasted just as good as any other Japanese restaurant I've been to. Mushroom and Crab Clay Pot ($40) 3.5/5 Comes out in a big clay pot, and rice is well seasoned with mushroom and snow crab. Overall quite tasty and portions are good enough for 2-3 people. Chu Toro Spicy okaka ($21)- 4.5/5 Yummy tuna sushi roll, although it seems and looks very basic. It had this crispyness to it, which was delicious. We ordered 2 rolls of this, and I still couldn't get enough. Raw Tuna & Avocado Salad ($22)- 3/5 The tuna to this had a quite strong fishy smell/taste to it, but it was bareable.En House Ice Cream ($10)- We got earl grey tea, fig, and fuji apple sorbet. The fuji apple sorbet was amazing, and the fig was unique.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

It's perfect for the occasional date - beautiful interior and lighting, fantastic Japanese food, but a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. EN is an izakaya style restaurant after all, so you get that homey, rustic/traditional feeling. We were seated at the center counter that wraps around this beautifully lit tree and fountain, which gave this place a calming, nature-like ambience.We both had the soyo kaze kaiseki, or multi-course meal. I think the Saikyo Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod and the Freshly Scooped Tofu were real standouts. The cod was mouth-wateringly buttery, and fresh tofu was a delight. We also loved the Stone Grilled Organic Chicken, which came on this classy looking stone slab. Every dish was beautifully presented - even the coffee I ordered.The Mochi Doughnuts with Ice Cream for dessert were AWESOME. They came fresh from the fryer and were so hot and steaming in the center.

7,bxnzQ5oanfcuWL7mYhs88w,Lisa L.,5.0 star rating,"Quality Japanese food can get very pricey in NYC, and by no means is ENJP cheap, BUT I thought the taste/portion size/uniqueness of the food perfectly justified the 3 digit bill my 2 girlfriends and I ended up paying. Unlike most Japanese tapas or specialty foods where the portion size can get unreasonably small, the dishes here were all shareable sizes, and I highly recommend that you go with a party of 3+ so that you can try various things on the menu without going bankrupt. Ambiance/interior was fantastic (could be a little too dark for some), but it's got a nice nature-y & city vibe to it.Food ordered:Age Dashi Tofu: Most people's favorite appetizer, and it's definitely mine. The portion size is great, and there's a good amount of mushroom that comes with it, so I highly recommend it! One of the best age tofus I've had. Tofus was both soft and chewy, and the sauce was great. Salmon Kama: It was very well cooked, and I enjoyed it. However, it's not very unique, since you can find nicely cooked salmon at other restaurants. Nonetheless, 'twas delicious. Mochi Croquette: So unique! I haven't seen a dish like this anywhere else, and I loved it! I think it's one of the must haves at ENJP, and the concept of a massive mochi ball with duck inside is quite genius. It's not the easiest to share because it's literally one massive mochi, but it's soft enough to tear with chopsticks and spoon. Also loved the sauce.Salmon Clay Rice Pot: Another yummy salmon dish, but it wasn't my favorite. The whole thing comes in a large clay pot, and the waiter brings it out to mix rice. You get served your own bowl of rice (the waiter does the scooping/dividing part as well), and then you get little bowl full of salmon roe and seaweed. I don't know how they seasoned the rice, but the whole concoction of seasoned rice + salmon + salmon roe + seaweed = pretty heavenly. It's a great dish to share! Chu Toro Spicy Okaka Roll: It was great, but great sushi rolls are easy to find at other places. I don't recommend you get sushi here when there are so many other delicious options that are unique to this restaurant. Dessert: White chocolate Tiramisu: So unique, and so delicious. It's definitely the traditional tiramisu, but I loved that it had such an authentic Japanese twist to it. There wasn't much bread/cookie texture that most tiramisu would have but it was extremely soft. Matcha + white chocolate = a whole new world. It was also very pretty! Mochi Doughnuts: My person favorite dessert of the night! The 3 little mochi doughnuts are made fresh to order so the doughnuts were literally hot when they initially came out. They pair it with vanilla ice cream, and it was pretty clear why they paired the two. SO GOOD.3 Scoops of ice cream: Don't remember the flavors, but they were all pretty fab. Honestly, all ice cream is fab. This is such a hidden (or not so hidden) gem in the Tribeca area. I can't wait to go back and try out everything on the menu. I hear the brunch selection is great!

Very sophisticated (and expensive). Open kitchen-the kitchen staff greets each table with a loud cheer as they enter the dining room. Excellent, unique cocktails. Home-made tofu (hot and cold). They make 3 batches daily so you know you're getting fresh goods.

Highly recommend for those who are okay with paying a bit more for a great dinning experience!ENVIRONMENT: the light is kind of dim inside which creates a bar-like atmosphere that's good for casual hangouts and date nights. Inside is very spacious and quiet enough. Service is great - waiters may be a little too attentive. They take the dishes as soon as I finish the food which makes me feel a little rushed. FOOD: So far everything I tried here are tasty. I highly recommend the Simon clay pot which is only available during dinner time. I tried the freshly scooped tofu and the grilled chicken, loved both!

Definitely a must go place if you wanna experience the beautiful of Japanese gourmet. Their service is great just like a proper Japanese service it would be. Their food is quite fresh and successfully keep the original flavor of it. For example they successfully preserve the flavor of soya and tofu which is simple, yummy and you can still taste the real soy bean. They have amazing tofu menu I think it's a must try every visit. Fish and Uni are yummy as well cooked properly. Their snow crab sushi roll can be a bit plain and the uni tofu portion is a bit small.

We didn't ordered off the pre-fix menu and our bill came out to about $800. Overall, it was a lovely experience and more like 3.5 star, but the décor was beautiful and the service was superb, therefore I upgraded them to 4 stars! Plenty of parking if you come after 8pm. We were a fan of some of the food but not all.Favorites:- My favorite dish of the night was definitely the toro salmon $7/piece. The fish literally melted in my mouth and was probably the most silky fish I have ever eaten in my life. - Wagu beef. Delicious but definitely not worth $250 per dish (Market Price). - Japanese oysters - amazing and sweet. -Miso Cod was spot on and very fresh and blasting with flavors- Fried Chicken Very Crispy and tender- Salmon in the clay pot - takes 40 minutes to cook but very worth the wait. - Garlic Rice - Yumm!Medicore--The freshly scoop tofu was ehhh at $11. Although very smooth, I preferred a pint in Chinatown for $1/pint- My sister ordered the cold side veggies and I didn't think it was anything special.-Truffle mousse and Truffle steamed eggs were just ok. Nothing to write home to. And at $26-28/ dish...probably not worth it. - Organic Chicken on the hot stone was not great. The stone overcooked the chicken if you leave it on for a long time. So eat it quick or it'll get stuck on the stone. -There was this salad dish that I wasn't too big of a fan of.

I don't know how they seasoned the rice, but the whole concoction of seasoned rice + salmon + salmon roe + seaweed = pretty heavenly. It's a great dish to share! Chu Toro Spicy Okaka Roll: It was great, but great sushi rolls are easy to find at other places. I don't recommend you get sushi here when there are so many other delicious options that are unique to this restaurant. Dessert: White chocolate Tiramisu: So unique, and so delicious. It's definitely the traditional tiramisu, but I loved that it had such an authentic Japanese twist to it. There wasn't much bread/cookie texture that most tiramisu would have but it was extremely soft. Matcha + white chocolate = a whole new world. It was also very pretty! Mochi Doughnuts: My person favorite dessert of the night! The 3 little mochi doughnuts are made fresh to order so the doughnuts were literally hot when they initially came out. They pair it with vanilla ice cream, and it was pretty clear why they paired the two. SO GOOD.3 Scoops of ice cream: Don't remember the flavors, but they were all pretty fab. Honestly, all ice cream is fab. This is such a hidden (or not so hidden) gem in the Tribeca area. I can't wait to go back and try out everything on the menu. I hear the brunch selection is great!

Overall, it was a lovely experience and more like 3.5 star, but the décor was beautiful and the service was superb, therefore I upgraded them to 4 stars! Plenty of parking if you come after 8pm. We were a fan of some of the food but not all.Favorites:- My favorite dish of the night was definitely the toro salmon $7/piece. The fish literally melted in my mouth and was probably the most silky fish I have ever eaten in my life. - Wagu beef. Delicious but definitely not worth $250 per dish (Market Price). - Japanese oysters - amazing and sweet. -Miso Cod was spot on and very fresh and blasting with flavors- Fried Chicken Very Crispy and tender- Salmon in the clay pot - takes 40 minutes to cook but very worth the wait. - Garlic Rice - Yumm!Medicore--The freshly scoop tofu was ehhh at $11. Although very smooth, I preferred a pint in Chinatown for $1/pint- My sister ordered the cold side veggies and I didn't think it was anything special.-Truffle mousse and Truffle steamed eggs were just ok. Nothing to write home to. And at $26-28/ dish...probably not worth it. - Organic Chicken on the hot stone was not great. The stone overcooked the chicken if you leave it on for a long time. So eat it quick or it'll get stuck on the stone. -There was this salad dish that I wasn't too big of a fan of.

I noticed that a lot of the items that are on the dinner menu are also on the lunch menu, but several dollars more expensive- presumably they are the same portions and quality?First off, this place is pretty expensive. I was initially under the impression that some of the fish or chicken dishes would come with rice or some sort of side... but no, which puts the pricing of these dishes in better context... When I came on Saturday, I tried to order the yellowtail, which they told me was sold out (this was about 8:00 PM at night), so instead I got some type of grilled salmon instead, even though I was looking forward to trying the yellowtail ($22)- it wound up tasting fine, but was pretty small. My friend and I also ordered the tofu to share ($11), which was a surprise for me- I had thought it would be on the sweet side, but it instead turned out to be salty with some kind of soy sauce accompaniment. It was definitely very fresh, but I didn't love it. We also ordered a garlic fried rice ($10), as well as some salmon sashimi, both of which were pretty good.The whole time I was here, I found it incredibly difficult to flag down our waiter, who seemed to constantly be avoiding us.The interior of this place is quite stunning, and is a fashionable place to bring someone to hang out if you aren't too hungry or want a good selection of drinks, or want to impress someone, so I'm not ruling out ever coming back here.

Uh, how is WHAT? The food we don't have? Aren't you supposed to apologize about the wait, not ask us how we're enjoying the... empty table... of nothing? This happened 3 times (I counted, for sanity) and was sooo awkward.

You are paying a premium ($$) to ensure that every dish is solid but not every dish is going to be the best you've ever had 1. Scottish salmon Kama amakarani (fried salmon collar with negi and a black pepper / soy sauce vinaigrette) - holy crap. Most amazing salmon I've had. It's super flavorful. Right amount of saltiness. And incredibly fatty which just made it that much better. Meat was very tender and flavored. Also surprising that there actually was a lot of meat on it (very usually collars are just the bones + some flavor) - good bang for your buck and possibly my favorite / most memorable dish here (i.e. Would come to this restaurant for this)1. Kampachi Kama (grilled young yellowtail collar from Japan) - same comments as salmon collar above. Really good. Think I liked the salmon more. Both super flavorful, moist, tender etc but salmon was more fatty so just more flavorful / better. Both were great though 1. Uni don (with Chilean uni) - really solid uni and ikura combo. Lots of uni and delicious sweet flavor1. Truffle chawanmushi - so good. Egg was the perfect flavor / texture / consistency. Thin truffle slides added a really good addition. 2. Uni yuba sashimi - decent. Ponzu sauce gets poured on top of uni and yuba tofu. Overall decent flavors and good chilean uni. I would order again 3. Freshly made scooped tofu - I had such high hopes for this dish because I love tofu. The tofu ended up being just okay (from a texture and flavor standpoint) - the sauce was kind of strange and I didn't feel like I was eating something that was that much different from like something I could make. I've had better handmade tofu from other Japanese restaurants 3. Age dashi tofu - also disappointed. What you do get is good quantity for the bucks. The tofu was fried and placed into a huge bowl with a salty soup base and mushrooms. I liked the mushrooms the best of the dish. However the tofu skin wasn't fried enough (super soggy even on the parts not inside the broth). The tofu inside didn't absorb the broth. The broth itself tasted a little watered down and wasn't a very memorable flavor3. Hokkaido uni special - you got a wooden dish of uni with ~10 pieces on it for $60. The first piece I had tasted like gasoline. These were also really small pieces. I think in generally not worth it (from both a price perspective and the quality) - if this was Chilean uni (which was in the other dishes), I think it might have been more worth it but I would have just ordered two of the uni dons (about the same amount of uni) for about half the price",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

You know it's good when native Japanese folks frequent this place.My first experience here was for my husband's birthday & I had reserved a small tatami room for 6 people. The reservation process went smoothly & I had to fill out a form to reserve it, which wasn't complicated in the least. However, when we got there, they seemed to either have forgotten or confused me w/ someone else & brought me to a table. They straightened out the situation fairly quickly & we were brought to the requested tatami room. The service was very good & they took the time to explain things about the menu. We ended up all sharing family style. Their karaage was a big hit as was the beet tempura! I personally really liked both the summer truffle (they grate a fresh truffle in top!) AND salmon kamameshi as well as their warm homemade tofu! They even had matcha kakigoori (green tea shaved ice!)! Although it wasn't the best kakigoori I've ever had, they still put a happy birthday sign on the ice! Their matcha tiramisu is also excellent - not too strong, not too sweet. Our friend who's a Japanese native said the food tasted just like home!My 2nd adventure here entailed a roasted Saikyo miso cod set lunch including their yummy fresh tofu again & an amazing 5-piece bluefin chu-toro. The lunch prices are very reasonable too for a set - $25-$40. Dinner, of course more expensive w/ the room rental fee & all.

Now onto the food: All of us who attended this dinner were internationally and have our own NY fav's for Japanese Food (Sushi of Gari, Zuma, Brushstroke). The general consensus was that the House Made Tofu was pleasant, the Truffle mousse was a solid 7.5/10, the Uni Yuba Sashimi was 8/10, Black Cod was cold by the time it arrived, Crispy Fried Chicken was as good as relying purely on being deep fried can get, the Organic Chicken was excellent 9/10, Wagyu was also excellent, the Fried rice was a great 8.5/10 (which we ordered two portions of because of our forgotten dish and our distrust that the other dish could be churned out ""very quickly""), the toro roll was forgettable (please go to Sushi of Gari for fusion sushi or Sushi Yaska (great for budget sushi) instead). The desserts were solid, nothing special. Overall, would not return on my own accord. Wouldn't even pay two dollar signs for the foodhere!

The mushroom fern and tofu all go together perfectly. Nasu & Zucchini Agebitashi - I couldn't identify any pieces of eggplant but whether it was zucchini or eggplant it was really good. Nice clean flavors. Shira Ae - This was a bit disappointing. Found the cauliflower and broccoli too crunchy (I prefer slightly more cooked).Shaké Teishoku - Probably the best deal for brunch. It's actually a lot of food and I would have been full just eating this. Comes with a salad (simple but delicious with a light dressing), miso soup (standard but enjoyable), freshly made tofu (very good and creamy), kinoko kiriboshi daikon ohitashi (good/refreshing, not necessarily outstanding like the Zenmai Piri Kara, surprisingly a sizeable amount), and grilled salmon. I enjoyed the salmon although the outside edges are a bit overcooked, the middle was very tender and delicious. So don't be put off by your first few bites (or maybe just dig into the middle where the best bites are) because the middle of the salmon is very good.Matcha White Chocolate Tiramisu - Yum yum.

I'm not a picky eater and will eat most of a mediocre dish, but after one bite of this... that was it. No more! The texture is weird as well, *definitely* avoid this.  Something odd about the service is that unless you specify otherwise, they will bring out dishes as they are ordered on the menu if you go al la carte. I didn't know this, and assumed if you ordered garlic rice (no, not the rice that takes 40 mins to make, just regular) and a fish, they'd bring either the rice out first, with the fish, or shortly after the fish. Instead they brought the fish, then the rice maybe 20 minutes later? Kind of as a dessert? Why?Speaking of dessert, even the ice cream was just what I'd expect from like a $0.99 pizza place, just with slightly more exotic varieties.Everything else I tried, again, was not very good or memorable, which especially given the price point isn't really acceptable. The drinks were OK? The server was polite? The bathroom was clean? I'm really having trouble coming up with too much else positive. It was a very disappointing meal, one of the worst I've had in my many years in NYC. Go somewhere else.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"
97,FuwRKqzP1TGNlrSXzuMdxA,Sheila K.,2.0 star rating,"I was so excited to try this restaurant but once I was here the entire meal was underwhelming.Atmosphere and decor-wise this restaurant is beautiful and the staff is accommodating. I even walked in with a coffee from another shop and they offered to pour it into one of their own cups so that I didn't have to throw it away.The reason for the 2 star review is because the biggest disappointment was the reason I went to EN - the food. I went with my husband and a friend and we ordered the freshly made scooped tofu served warm. This was probably my favorite thing here! The tofu tasted fresh in a milky broth and was accompanied with a sweet soy dressing. We also ordered the truffle chawanmushi for the table. They describe it as a steamed egg custard with truffle and it tastes exactly as they describe it but without any seasoning. I ordered the kaisen don, my go-to dish at japanese restaurants. I was pretty disappointed with my dish. Instead of small cuts of raw fish, I had large chunks that were a bit tough to chew through. Also, most of my raw fish was salmon, which is probably my least favorite fish to eat raw. My husband got the steak & eggs. It was okay, but nothing special. If you order it, keep in mind the stone cools from cooking temperature within 10 minutes so it's not a meal that you can leisurely enjoy. The saving grace of the experience was the dish our friend ordered - the uni don. It was creamy and fresh with tons of sea urchin.We also got a glass of the gewürztraminer (grape juice) at $12 a glass and it is SO not worth it unless you're a fan of overly sweet juices. It tasted like pure liquid sugar.Overall, the food does not justify the prices. I likely won't be back. Also, we had a multiple week delay in our credit card processing the payment to this restaurant.

My personal favorite was the chicken karaage, even though I realize that it's just fried chicken. But still...the batter was perfectly seasoned and crispy, while the meat was insanely juicy and tender. Also, you get a pretty generous portion.The steak and egg was another great choice, even if it's just for the experience of using the hot stone to cook off the meat to your liking. The beef had just the right amount of fatty marbling to give it that wonderful mouth feel. The poached egg, which was swimming in some sort of soy mixture, was nice and runny on the inside.Their house-made tofu is another excellent standout. I'm not usually one to rave about tofu (or any other vegan food for that matter) but theirs was so silky smooth and creamy that I couldn't stop myself from finishing off the whole vat. And they did provide a generous portion, mind you. The sauce that it comes with is a game change. I drowned my tofu in it.Aside from the awesome food, the service was top notch.

Decor is great and their arrangement is little unique or strange, still makes great ambiance. Staffs were friendly and very attentive. I never had hard time to get a help when I needed. They have 3 choice of Kaiseki course but we made up our mind to go with A la carte as some of dishes on Kaiseki were not our favorite. We decided to try following items on menu. They were all delicious and enjoyable yet like many of others told, nothing was memorable. I think from this price range, you start to demand something memorable.Freshly made scooped tofu - although tofu is inexpensive food in general, it has very delicate process on making it. So well made fresh tofu is always precious thing despite its price. It was very well made tofu that I could enjoy - yet I've had better one numerous time.Uni Yuba Sashimi - Uni on the sliced tofu skin with Yuzu sauce. Uni was fresh and it was nice start for our meal. Miso marinated black cod - black cod is one of my favorite fish and I like it most when it is marinated with Miso glazed. It was delicious but it was slightly dry. I rather prefer moist one. Mochi Croquette - fail of the night. I don't get the concept for this food. Doesn't feel like mochi and dashi broth were making good combination. Croquette surface was soggy, not crispy.Salmon clay pot rice - It was better than I expected. Shiso leaf with Salmon and Salmon roe made great ensemble. When it came to the table, I was little skeptical on this as salmon roe didn't seem to be fresh but it was ok when you put it with rice. I didn't know shiso leaf can give this kind of texture when it is sliced very thin. Final touch from shiso leaf was made this rice pot impecable.Wagyu from Miyazaki - the dish of the day. Wagyu is always best as it simply melt in mouth. Every bites are joyful when you have them. It was perfectly cooked, indeed worth the price.EN ice cream - We choose fig/fuji apple/earl gray and they were all very delicious. My girlfriend called it best thing she had from here. I think I agree with her.Overall, it was great time being there. I will be coming back sometime when we are craving for Japanese food as we liked their ambiance very much.

109,TJPdPo8ppGmJji7V_VmZ7Q,Carmen K.,2.0 star rating,"Came in on a weekday night expecting my taste buds to have a little vacay and fun and came out thinking what the hell just happened in there? I don't even know where to begin, but let's start with the service. I'm pretty sure it was the waiter we had who absolutely ruined the experience for us. He probably thought he was being witty half the time, but it just came out condescending and rude. When someone asks you for your recommendation on sake, you don't go: ""well there are 2 pages right in that book so why don't you look there?"" What do you think we were doing with the book wide open in front of us? What do you think you're here for? His response for food recommendations were pretty much the same: ""Just flip back over to the front of the menu, look and you'll see a sample of our dinners"" (??? what?!). I'm not sure if he's trained to do this and be a master at vagueness or if the other waiters/waitresses do the same, but someone please explain how this is acceptable to me especially from a restaurant like this where better service is expected. There was a moment when some orders got mixed up by another waiter who brought it over, which was fine, we quickly switched things back. What was unacceptable was him making the remark that it was ""his first day here"" and thus to forgive him. Absolutely unprofessional and rude of him to say that of another staff member. It is so minor, just apologize, or not since the other guy did already, and move along and do your job. Don't place blame on anyone else. He was also inattentive and service was slow. Onto the food, dishes were either a hit or miss. Top dishes:-Truffle chawanmushi: absolutely delicious, best dish of the night. It's a warm egg custard in a tea cup with truffles that's just bursting with flavor-Wagyu beef: amazing melt-in-your-mouth slices of beef, love it best with the salt that it comes with-Takenoko sashimi: literally just sliced bamboo shoots, but surprisingly good-Raw tuna and avocado salad: super fresh, super delicious-Assorted sashimi: we had the 21 pieces and everything was super fresh with huge portions per piece so that was nice-Sliced rib eye salad: flavors were very well balanced between the rib eye, dressing, and greensEverything else:-Fresh tofu: I wasn't a huge fan of it, most of us at the table weren't, but some of us liked it-Lobster ishiyaki: probably the most disappointing dish of the night, tiny thing pieces of lobster that sorta has a punch of flavor but nothing memorable and just a dud-Sakuramasu usuzukuri: slices of sea trout sashimi, it was eh. 8 tiny bland pieces for $25-Uni (roll): says there's shrimp but I swear ours didn't have any?! It was just cucumber in the middle with uni on top. Uni was fresh, other than that the roll wasn't that great-Snow crab tempura (roll): it was alright, nothing impressive-Black cod: it was alright-Ebi shinjo: this was a fried ball of shredded shrimp, not memorable-Fried chicken: what you would expect-Clay pots: they offer 4 different kinds, we had a couple including the truffle one, I wouldn't recommend itDesserts, on the other hand, were all delicious. Best was definitely the matcha white chocolate tiramisu and the tea pudding. I couldn't find the dessert menu online so my memory's shaky here, but they also had an interesting assortment of ice cream flavors that were really good.Drinks: We didn't know much about sake, they had flights available which was nice. Of the cocktails, they weren't the best, and pretty much tasted bad. Surprisingly, the non alcoholic drinks ended up being so much better. Love the seppun, and pineapple juice with ginger.Overall, I felt it wasn't worth the price. Sure there are some hit dishes, but honestly, you can get similar dishes at other top Japanese restaurants around the city for similar prices, and wayyy better service. No one at our table felt satisfied. I rarely write such a long and detailed review, but the disappointment here is strong.

My friend and I both had the $120 tasting menu, and neither of us liked any of the courses. The dishes were conceptually over-complicated. Everything tasted mildly sweet, some courses nauseatingly so. A few of the dishes looked pretty enough, but if a restaurant can't do both, we'd much rather the food be pleasing to our tongues than our eyes.There was a long wait (more than 25 minutes) between the fourth and the fifth course, and the resulting dish was a lukewarm piece of waygu beef on top of an almost cold piece of cooked fish, the crispy skin on the fish getting soggy from the wet beef, which was so raw that blood was dripping down to the fish. As my friend said, it's the most disgusting thing she's ever been served.The decor was cool, but the service was inattentive. We didn't even get our water glasses refilled until we're almost done with the meal. The only good thing was the drinks, which were pretty tasty, but at $17 a glass, it'd better be.We would never come back here even if they paid us to.

My most recent visit would be the third time getting the Soyo Kase, one of 3 types of testing menus that are offered. Our table of 4, double date, decided to also do 2 sake pairings to share. The sake flight ranged from dry to sweet, to floral, to fruity, to grainy, a breadth of of flavors meant to enhance the pairing with each course.We met up at the bar before being seated and shared some amazing cocktails: Cucumber, Sochu, and Seppun Cocktails. They have a great spirits, sake, beer menu with many options to choose from and knowledgeable bartenders.Our first course of O-Banzai were a refreshing seaweed, mushrooms, radish, veggie trio medley. Then came the typical sashimi of salmon, tuna, and amberjack laid out on shiso leaves. The main fish was then brought out Saikyo Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod and was  so good with a umami laden marinade and sweetness of the cod coming through.Then we had some fresh house made scooped tofu. It was milky, delicate, and the perfectly milled soybeans gave it a nice consistency. We then took a break and they brought out a truffle chawanmushi (not included on the tasting menu) which was luxurious with ample shavings on top. The steamed egg was velvety and beautifully enveloped the truffles with each soft bite. Heaven!Then came the main meat dish, grilled organic chicken on top of a hot stone that sizzled and you could sear to your liking. It really brings out the flavors of the chicken cooked this way and personalized.The warm soba in a dashi broth came and was a nice closer to the meal, yet whet our palates enough to anticipate the desserts to come. The seasonal ice cream was Chestnut flavor, very delicate with a nice clean palate. In addition to the tasting menu, we also got the Matcha Tiramisu that had a very strong Matcha flavor but had a lovely mellow, creamy tiramisu underneath, and a Pumpkin Panna Cotta that was also very well done and leverages the highlights of the seasonal elements.Overall, this is a wonderful place for any occasion.

I thought it would be smoother and softer like Ooyotas but it definitely still tasted fresh. It came with a side of soy sauce and salt.Organic Chicken: I think this was the best dish of the nite! The chicken was surprisingly flavorful and came with some dipping powders. It was also super tender. Get this!Miso Cod: This fish was too sweet for my taste, but the quality was good. If you like a sweet miso flavor, then you will like this.Lobster Ishiyaki: This dish was not worth the price, IMO. You only get a few little slices of lobster and the flavor isn't that great, either.Pork Belly: This dish was very meh. The meat wasn't tender and the radishes didn't have any flavor. Wouldn't recommend.Salmon Clay Rice Pot: This was so tasty! But I love rice in general. I loved the flavor of the salmon mixed into the rice with the fish eggs on top. Yummmmm. SO goood.Blowfish ""Wings"": These fried ""wings"" were totally not worth it. There is like no fish on the bones and there were soooo many tiny little bones I felt like I was just eating breading.Donuts: They were just chewy mochi balls that are fried with a side of vanilla ice cream.

135,O1s1VhNA-FR8vljGfDSLUQ,Kevin C.,3.0 star rating,"12/6/2015First timer here.  Made a reservation online for two about a week prior to the reserved date after looking around for a decent Japanese restaurants in the city.  I asked for bar seats in a hope to watch the kitchens working their magic.Atmosphere and vibe are 2 key factors that affect my preference over one another and my willingness to go back to the same restaurant, and I have to admit that the EN Japanese Brasserie did well on atmosphere and vibe.  Expect a rather formal dress code although not necessary, and I thought it was pretty cool to listen to a way lady greets you in Japanese when you first enter the restaurant and being guided to your seat as well.But first thing first, about the food.I took my lady friend on a date and we ordered ""Soyo Kaze,"" which was one of the course meals offered in the menu.  Please note that we did not get a sake/shochu pairings although I strongly think it would not have had any impact on my yelp rating.And before I start off with the course menu- staff explained what the each presented menu in front you was and how it should be eaten (for a more flavorful way to eat I suppose), so hopefully that helps if you were wondering if you would be explained of what is in front of you and how to enjoy it.The course meal started with ""O-Banzai,"" a chef's selection of 3 Kyoto-style appetizers.  I actually really enjoyed the mushroom a lot but unfortunately I do not recall the name.The fact that I came in a bit hungry still would not change my opinion of how good the mushroom was.  Very fresh and flavorful. I usually don't enjoy mushrooms all that much but I enjoyed it.2nd menu in the course was ""Chef's Sashimi Selection,"" which was presented with 3 varieties of sashimi with 2 pieces each.  The presentation of the dish was very simple and clean- nothing too fancy.  Sashimis were one of the better ones I have had this year.  Too bad it was only 6 pieces which was gone within a minute or two even though I tried to eat them slowly enjoying the texture and a flavor..Next up was ""Saikyo Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod,"" which looked and tasted pretty decent.  Coming from a Korean family, my mother always cooked a variety of fish, and I know what a good fish tastes like when cooked to a perfection.  A bit of sweetness and a saltiness of this grilled cod proved to be quite decent.4th on the menu was ""Freshly Scooped Tofu.""  Coming from an Asian family, this was no surprise and it was medicore to be honest.  I am not saying it was bad.  If you like tofu, give it a shot.5th on the menu was ""Stone Grilled Organic Chicken."" I kind of had to laugh at this not because it wasn't good, but it had me wonder if there are non-organic chickens out there. They probably meant they are serving a chicken that was fed with organic grains, etc..  Make sure you do not burn yourself as the stone is indeed very hot.  Chicken itself was very tender and I could not taste any rawness.  Much better than the chicken I cook from time to time for my lunch if that helps you see what kind of taste you can expect from a chicken.  How good can chicken get? Figure it out..6th on the menu was ""Warm Soba,"" and I have to say that I am not a too fan of warm soba.  I will take warm ramen over warm soba any day.  This was probably my least favorite on the course menu.7th on the menu, and the last ""finale"" was an ice cream.  ""Kisetsu No Ice Cream.""  It tells you it will be a seasonal ice cream, and I believe what we were given was a light purplish ice cream of a flavor I can't recall.  Ice cream was alright. Nothing fancy!****CONCLUSION****I know some of you probably already scrolled down all the way saying this guy is just too much.  But listen, this is important- do not waste your money on this course menu.  I and my lady friend agreed that we should have just ordered Uni-Don of some sort and maybe 2 or 3 delicious rolls they were making in front of us instead of medicore course menu.I will have to go back here another time to try some other offerings that is NOT a course menu.  I am only going to give 3 stars (3.5 if I could pick 3.5 out of 5) for now until I go back and try something better.  Atmosphere and vibe were nice if you are into that vs. the taste and offerings, and the value of the food.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

The salmon special came with so many items! Miso soup, salad, housemade tofu, nori, small dishes, and of course the salmon and rice. The salmon was of a melt in your mouth quality; it was amazing. This dish definitely had the most bang for your buck, and it also helps that it was yummy.After a long night out, the udon was heavenly to me. The noodles weren't too hard or too soft, and the soup had a nice, light flavor to it. The three sides that we got- lotus root, pork, and greens were also delicious. Our favorite from the three was the lotus root; it was surprisingly crunchy and had great texture. I wish I had come here for dinner to try their specialties, as I felt that the choices were super limited and were more basic. On a side note, the server up-sold us their housemade ginger ale that was NINE dollars. No alcohol or anything, just a tea cup (the ones that are used for green tea) filled with ginger ale.

The tofu was silky and had a bit of a texture to it and came with a salty soy-like sauce.Lobster Ishiyake - small pieces of lobster served on a stone. Super small plate for $22, but lobster was nice.Crispy Fried Chicken - I expected this to be amazing! But it was very regular fried chicken. Super tender though!Kurobuta Kakuni - braised pork belly - i love a braised pork belly! This was a little tough to chew on but quite yummy, though was lacking a sort of umami flavor. The one at Kyo-Ya is much better in comparison!Matsutake Rice Pot - took forever to come out and was enough for 4 small bowls...for $36 which is pricey for rice...Uni-don - not a fan of uni but there was lots of it in here!

This extremely large space, perfectly designed offers up Japanese cuisine that goes beyond sushi. They have sister locations in Japan, but this locale is the only one outside of the mother country. Although it isn't cheap, I find EN to be of great value and I whole heartedly recommend.The homemade tofu is the bees knees: so salty, so creamy, so smooth. The sashimi plate isn't cheap, but some extremely fresh fish and large cuts to boot. The 21 piece (priced at $78) is more than enough for two or even three. Fish isn't at all exotic (minus a piece or two), but last night's toro was PERFECTION and 3 huge cuts. Most places would charge you $30-40 for that alone.I wasn't a fan of the stone crab rice pot, I found it to be a tad bland, but the large cuts of crab were the highlight. Portion size was enough for 3-4 people to enjoy a side bowl, but I would totally suggest it for sharing only. A huge hit was the pork belly which was a steal at $21-22. So much perfectly braised pork belly, not at all fatty and full flavored of that soy-wasabi sauce. Honestly, it could have easily feed 3-4 people if you are going family style with a lot of different dishes. Get it, you won't be disappointed.Service and ambiance is on point and the Japanese beer list will impress any aficianado.

170,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"I started off the latest season of Restaurant Week with a visit to EN Japanese Brasserie. Set in the heart of West Villlage, the restaurant has an inconspicuous entrance on Hudson Street. Enter, though, and you'll find yourself in an expansive, modern take on a Japanese izakaya. The scattering of foliage throughout the dining rooms, the abundance of windows that let in the last rays of sunlight, and the simple, yet elegant decor is absolutely stunning, and is the perfect set up for a leisurely meal.After checking in with the hostess, we were led to our seats and had warm towels offered to us as well as glasses of water. I had skimmed the menu beforehand, so it only took a few minutes until we were prepared to order. The offering for Restaurant Week is pretty straightforward, letting diners sample a 4-course menu for a mere $38 at dinner. They also offer an option of a sake flight, which you can add on for a supplemental charge. Our meal began with the famed homemade Agedashi Tofu, which EN has recieved much praise for. Served in a lacquer box with a wooden spoon, it appears far too basic at first glance. The tofu is garnished only with a few slivers of green onion and finished off with a drizzle of wari joyu, the restaurant's housemade sauce that consists of soy sauce and fish broth. The sheer simplicity of this dish, however, is what makes it successful. The tofu is an indescribable texture of creamy and silky, and the soybean flavor becomes more pronounced with the addition of the wari joyu. Each bite is as perplexing as the last, and just as enjoyable.The following two courses were the least successful, in my opinion. We were served a small side of chilled vegetables that consisted of mushrooms as well as broccoli and cauliflower. While I enjoyed the lightness of the mushrooms, the latter vegetables were far too cold and crunchy. It also needed some additional seasoning besides the sprinkling of sesame seeds on top. As for the Tuna with Negi, which served as the main course, it was far too complicated than it needed to be. While the tuna had been neatly pan fried, it was served with an overwhelming amount of sliced negi on top, which seemed to completely take over the bowl. The pepper-soy vinaigrette was fairly one dimensional as well, and the presentation of the rice on a small, square plate made the meal even more confusing. Thankfully though, we ended the meal on a positive note with the Black Sesame Ice Cream. We were each given just one scoop in a bowl, and the moment I had my first spoonful, I knew it wouldn't be enough. The texture is unbelievably silky and the flavor perfectly highlights the black sesame, bringing out the unmuted taste, and isn't overly sweet either.In the end, I have to leave an average rating for EN Japanese Brasserie; while not all the dishes were successes, the ones that were truly brought out the best in Japanese cuisine: simple ingredients and flavors done well.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I had the opportunity to visit En on last Wednesday. I am lowering the rating to 2 stars given the experience we had there. The hosts were rude and inflexible! We had a 7:15PM reservation for 4. After a long day at work, 3 of us arrived at 7:15PM, the 4th person was running late, likely in the subway and were unable to reach him by cell phone. The host would not seat us because all were not present. I explained the 4th person was on his way - no we cannot seat you was the response. This is policy. Now I understand that this is the policy and it makes sense if you are dealing with a party of 8 people and 2 have arrived, makes sense for all to be seated at the same time. But in this case we are taking about a party of 4 with 3 people present. Now practically, most tables are for an even number of people - tables that seat 4 people are very common, I did not see a single table at En that seats 3. Given the long day at work and some of us were from out of town, we called the 4th person and told him that we would catch up with him later, so we could proceed with our meal. So the host finally agree to seat us - and guess what - THEY SEATED US AT A TABLE OF SIX. We looked around there were plenty of open tables. So what is the reason for the inflexibility. The service during the dining experience was questionable as well - the waitress did not bother to explain the menu or the specials. We had ordered sushi, the waiter did not bother to bring us soy sauce. The food was excellent, the hosts rude, arrogant, and inflexible, and the service questionable. Here is the equation from this experience - they stuck to their inflexible policy, were not able to salvage the one seat they were trying and in the process they will lose 4 customers, one of whom thought very highly of the place. 2 stars.

It was fairly empty when I got there. The seating was very lobby-like, very open with big leather chairs, not what I expected at all.The waiters came by several times before we ordered which probably is because there weren't that many people here. The $25 lunch only had a vegetable tempura option for those who do not eat meat/pork so I ended up going with the black cod lunch set ($22). The lunch set comes with a small portion of miso black cod, miso soup, a mushroom tofu salad, a green salad, a wakame& bean sprout salad, tofu, and rice, which I substituted for pickles. Though the fish portion was really small, it was one of the best tasting fish I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and not too masked by the sauce and spices. The small dishes that came with the fish made up for the small portion. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms for they had a very beefy/smokey taste. The tofu was great as well and will definitely order that again.My father had the $25 prix fix lunch which came with two small mushroom salads (one was instead of the rice) the first was citrus-yuzu-ish tasting and the second was the same one I got, which was very 'umami'. He got the wagyu beef which is why I gave them 4 stars and not 5. He really enjoyed the beef but the waiter did not tell us it was $13 extra nor did he make a accommodations for the misunderstanding. For dessert, he had the fig ice cream which realistically I ate most of it. It was really delicious and the fig taste was very dominant. He also had the genmaicha tea which was super earthy tasting (in a good way) I would highly recommend getting the lunch set for it is a vert large portion with really great ingredients for a reasonable price.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I went there the 2nd time last Friday and is determined not to return. 5 of us did family style so I can comment on quite a few dishes:- Scooped tofu: it's kind of bland so you have to add soy sauce. But then it's kind of weird to mix tofu which is naturally a little sweet with soy sauce. I wish they give you brown sugar like in the Chinese restaurant which will blend much better with tofu.- Raw tuna and avocado salad: it's the best dish we had which is reasonably-priced- Lobster Ishiyaki: It is probably the smallest entree I have ever seen in my life. It's smaller than a plate on the tasting menu. With such a small portion priced at $22, I expect the lobster to be Maine quality. Unfortunately it was far from it.- Black Sea bass Nitsuke: They did say whole but I wasn't expecting to see the whole fish with it's eye staring at me. I would not recommend anybody to get this dish unless you LOVE picking out tiny bones constantly.- Saikyo Miso black cod: it was on the tasting menu so I knew it was good. It did not disappoint. - Snow crab tempura avocado: I would have love this if they did not put wasabi inside my roll. Have they not consider not everybody eat wasabi??? If you insist on having wasabi embedded in your roll, warn me in the descriptions please. I can't eat any of it. - En garlic Shiso fried rice: it was the WORST fried rice we ever had in our lives! There's nothing fried about that rice. It was plain white and tasteless. They add seaweed and some kind of green stuff on it. But it was tasteless, and taste even worse than the plain rice we ordered. DO NOT GET!- Uni Don: Very bland and taste very weird. DO NOT GET!after the very not impressive dishes, we took a leap of faith and ordered 3 desserts. Forgot what their names were, but one is something with mochi, something with chocolate and something with chestnut. They were ok but after a really bad meal, they tasted pretty good.On top of that, our waiter was not attentive at all. He never came and ask if our dish was ok (I would have said something then and there to the waiter instead of blast it on Yelp). Nobody came and take away the dishes that we finished.

It's a terrible reason for coming, but I decided on this place because I saw a picture of uni ice cream on Instagram and it was an easy reservation, surprising given how busy it seemed, but I didn't regret it.EN was a fantastic experience though, definitely one of the better places we tried on this three day trip to NYC. The presentation was fantastic, and the atmosphere was very casual friendly. Sometimes when you're eating Japanese food, the itamae stares at you and is silently judging you while you eat. No such qualms here, you're free to be as shameless as you want to be, and take pictures without feeling too bad.My favourite dish actually came with the vegan kaiseki. The second course was a bean curd salad with a buttery soymilk dressing. The fantastic part was the presentation, coming with a glass down that emanated smoke as soon as it was removed.

185,UX_rERRiT-28q2XRHz5rZQ,Mich L.,5.0 star rating,"EN is underrated by far in the grand scheme of restaurants in NYC. I always get lazy when it comes to reviewing EN because there are too many things that they do well that make it a headache to review. But fine, ""it's a new year, a new me"" as the horrible cliché goes so here is an attempted review for EN:EN is the Japanese restaurant that ""foodies"" want to condemn as ""inauthentic"" because of the sleek, cool interior but can't once they actually taste the soul of the food. Nothing is ever half-assed at EN, not even at lunchtime when it's easy to slack off because who cares? Well, EN does. Even from the small Obanzai dishes, you can tell that they make an effort for the food to speak for itself. Want to know what's really good at EN? As cliché as it sounds, the sashimi. Actually, one wouldn't necessarily expect the sashimi to be noteworthy upon examining the menu full of creative dishes. Still, get the sashimi -- the freshness of the fish here is better than some actual sushi places. Some restaurants are only good at cooking a certain type of food, such as specializing in seafood, meat, etc. At EN though, it doesn't matter whether you order the ""Saikyo Black Miso Cod"" or the Stone grilled beef. You can expect that there will always be a high standard reached for any dish because EN is pretty well-rounded. My rambling point is -- I appreciate the eye for quality and technique that EN demonstrates towards every aspect of their menu. Just as the food is carefully crafted, so is the menu. Some of EN's best dishes are the simplest ones that highlight the true flavors of the ingredients. My one critique of EN is that some may not be used to the simple flavors in some of the dishes. They aren't going to go soy-sauce crazy on anything here. Still, even if something ultimately doesn't end up suiting your taste, you can't deny that the freshness or skill isn't present in the dishes. To end the review as obnoxiously ostensible as possible, shout out to the ""Truffle Mousse.""

We had a private room upstairs and we had the prix-fixe meal. Though the service started off great, after a while, it got pretty bad. We were supposed to have a server devoted to our party but it seemed like he was also waiting tables downstairs, because he was hard to track down. Also, the food took way too long to come out. Considering we had the prix-fixe and no one ordered anything other than what was listed on the menu, it was pretty unacceptable. Dinner started around 9pm and ended after 10:30. At one point, we waited almost 20 minutes for the next course to be served.However, I will give them props for the food. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and delicious. We had the $65 prix-fixe meal which consisted of an soy-sauce soaked edamame starter, freshly scooped tofu with a fishy soy sauce, a trio of vegetables (mushrooms, bracken, and some snap pea mixture), miso black cod, stone grilled chicken with a sauce and two types of salt, salmon rice with roe and shiso leaves, and a green tea ice cream for dessert. The food was good; I'd say the miso black cod and the stone-grilled chicken were the most worthwhile dishes. The salmon rice was delicious but nothing special (meaning I could have easily made it at home). The green tea ice cream was creamy and delicious.After dinner, we opened up the dining area to the sitting area (there's a sliding door) and had a bigger party with more people. We had an open bar with hors d'oeuvres platters. There was a fried chicken platter that was amazing. The open bar consisted of sake, red wine, white wine, and beer. It was $30 and I think it was a decent price, considering the never-ending plates of food and unlimited alcohol.Honestly, if the service had just been slightly more on point or even if the staff had acknowledged and apologized how slow they were with our food, I think I'd have been more forgiving and upped my review to 4 stars. However, some of the servers were really curt when we asked them why the food was taking so long and we got answers like, ""Well, the chef is making each course for you guys. This particular dish takes 40 minutes to complete."" That's not what I want to hear. I want to hear, ""I will check on that for you."" and I want to them to serve my food in a timely manner!I think if we had just dined downstairs like normals, we would probably have had a better experience. The ambiance is lovely and I think most people who come here enjoy themselves - which is made really apparent by the overwhelming number of 5-star reviews.

The restaurant is decorated beautifully like a modern, contemporary NYC Japanese restaurant. At night, the restaurant is slightly dimmed, which really enhances the decor that consists of lightly colored walls and clean, smooth designs. The ambiance is very quiet, yet not too quiet where you feel like you are yelling when you are speaking at your normal tone. On the night I went, I saw Martha Stewart dining in the main room at the bar. Our waitress actually alerted us to her presence to our surprise. It was actually pretty cool seeing her dine by herself in this nice, quiet restaurant.As for the food, I won't comment on it much as it's what you would expect at a modern NYC Japanese restaurant. There is a plentiful amount of rice and seafood concoctions on the menu, with a modern blend of course. There was one unique item that we did order and it was the Scooped Tofu. It arrived in a wooden square box with a scooper inside. It was the one unique item I remembered the most. The Tofu was very soft and almost in a liquid form, but had a sweetness to it that really hits you hard. You wouldn't expect that amount of flavor from just Tofu.It's really nice restaurant, with an intimate feel to it. It's a great place for a date night, but if you're not willing to splurge restaurant week is a great time to give this place a try.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

195,XBRFpzDjvLFzSssDnj_1Cg,Sam R.,5.0 star rating,"My long-standing love affair with ENJB began 3 years ago during restaurant week. It was a super hot summer evening and ENJB's trendy, open space was slightly too large to promote an easily-cooled environ. But nevermind the slightly warmed atmosphere, it only stands out in memory as making all the more sweet one of the MOST refreshing and amazing cocktails I ended up trying.  Laaaaaadies (and gents), I'm talking about the Seppun cocktail. Made with shiso leaf, grapefruit juice & yuzu juice with Takara Jun 35 shochu, this is one of my favorite cocktails ever. I may have had shiso leaf previously, but up until that moment I hadn't appreciated this fine herb. Folks have referred to it as ""Japanese basil,"" but calling it ""basil"" would do this fab leaf serious injustice. To me, I do sorta taste some basil, but I also get an interesting licorice flavor, along with spearmint and just a hint of citrus. amazing drink--hooked for life (also obsessed with yuzu).In terms of the food, everything was excellent. A few highlights I recommend:-saikyo miso marinated grilled black cod-freshly scooped tofu served with wari-joyu (I believe there's something of an art to timing when to go for the freshest tofu--it's like on the hour or something)-shoyu-braised thinly sliced pork belly & lotus root-hijiki seaweed, snow peas, green beans, shirataki, and soy beans simmered in shoyu-Stone grilled kuroge washugyu-salmon clay rice pot -EN garlic shiso fried rice-mochi croquette with potato & Hudson Valley duck, covered with mochi rice cake, served in a hearty dashi broth-black sesame ice creamI've been maybe 5 times, and this place never disappoints.I've also been to their ""first thursdays"" (of the month) where they serve homey ""family meals"" beginning 9:30 pm i.e., meals similar to what the kitchen staff tends to cook with leftovers. The event was described as ""Dishes change monthly but past dinners have included: sake-marinated whole roasted tuna collar, crispy salmon skin salad with aromatic yuzu-citrus dressing, fresh tofu salad, delicate sea bream-head soup, crunchy deep fried eel and fluke bones, braised wagyu beef tips, sashimi ends over vinegared rice, and steaming butajiru, hearty pork and vegetable miso soup. Dinner includes all the Sapporo beer you can drink, of course. Chef Abe and his cooks wouldn't have it any other way.""

He had the pineapple sparkling wine and I had the ginger (ginger beer, rice shochu and lime juice). They were both fragrant and delicious. They were $13 each. I had no idea NYC charged tax on drinks. I was a little shocked when I closed out the tab. Thankfully dinner was minutes away.For dinner we had the house made tofu served cold. It was exquisite. Silky and fresh. I wanted to eat it all by myself. Drizzle a small amount of sauce and salt then enjoy. The tofu is so good. The black miso cod followed and although the portions were a little small, each bite was mouth-watering. I've tried black miso cod at a bunch of different places, and EN does it the best. Give it a try here. You'll be happy. The fried chicken here is really good but a little salty. I suggest ordering rice with it to balance it out. They are very generous with the portions and the chicken is definitely extra juicy. Dessert included the fried black sesame kochi and the ice cream trio. The fried mochi was exactly what it sounds like. I'm not the biggest fan but it is what it is and you shouldn't expect something different. Their ice cream is very good. I tried vanilla, fig, green tea, and earl grey. My favorite is the fig. It was savory and sweet. I loved it.

I still prefer Zenkichi's, and they're about the same price point.My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner, and I immediately loved the ambiance. Open layout, beautiful details, and even a special area with tatami mats. We arrived around 6PM on a Saturday evening and it wasn't crowded at all. Most of the customers seemed to be Japanese, which is always a great sign!Let's do a breakdown of the omakase:O-Banzai (chef's selection of three appetizers): 7/10I was expecting this to be tiny but each dish was actually pretty substantial for an appetizer. We received two mushroom dishes (I love mushrooms!) and another with seaweed, green beans, and snow peas. Lots of earthy flavor, and they all went together well.Chef's Sashimi Selection: 5/10This was just average. Yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. The quality was good, but that's about all I can say about this dish. I was hoping for some more unique selections or some mouthwateringly-buttery salmon, but it wasn't the case.Miso black cod: 8/10Definitely the highlight of the omakase, but again, Zenkichi's black cod was better! Still, the portion was sizable and my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this one.Fresh scooped tofu: 6/10Exactly as described. It's very soft texture, slightly cold, and comes with a sauce to pour onto it. I thought this was only OK, but nothing to write home about. If you're a big fan of tofu, you'll probably dig it.Stone grilled organic chicken: 6/10The stone grill made for an interesting presentation and it's definitely a filling dish, but I would have preferred a more unique choice of meat. Perhaps duck? Maybe that's just wishful thinking...Cold soba: 5/10Meh, I felt pretty bored with this soba, but I do usually love soba (especially at Cocoron or Soba-ya). It wasn't super flavorful, but was a refreshing way to end the meal, I suppose.Seasonal ice cream: 8/10One small scoop of homemade strawberry ice cream - very, very good, but very small (by my standards).Don't get me wrong, this was a perfectly fine omakase at a very lovely restaurant, but it just didn't knock it out of the park for me.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I eat out at least 4 times a week across town. Last night's service at EN was by far the worst I've experienced in the city, especially for the price we had to pay (bill was $250 for 3). Honestly, I still haven't quite figured out what we've done to deserve this kind of service. A number of things went wrong throughout the night: 1) Seating Policy - Our booking was for 6.30pm. The tables at the restaurant were barely filled. My mom and sister arrived on time and I ran a bit late. They were hungry already and wanted to order and begin without me. The hostess insisted that I must be there before they can get seated. And they were not nice about it. I understand this seating policy is prevalent across many restaurants in the city. But when your restaurant is barely filled and you have hungry customers ready to eat, why can't you just seat them and let them order? My family waited for 20 minutes, at least. 2) Unfriendly host - We were given a four person table right next to the work station. There were empty tables all around us so I asked if we can move to the table at the corner. The hostess stared straight into my eye and snapped ""We are very full today. You can't do this."" I asked again and she snapped some more.  I thought that was unfriendly and a bit unnecessary. 3) Subpar Service  - Our server passed us the menu after we sat down. Not an ounce of smile or remote sense of friendliness. I said we were ready to order and she snapped ""I'll be back."" Only about 10 minutes later she came back to take our orders. Again, no smiles, no eye contact throughout the entire order taking. Never felt more unwelcome and awkward. 4) Discrepancy in service - About 40 minutes into our meal, three men were seated right next to us. The same server who served us attended to them. Immediately bright smiles, warm greetings and pleasantries exchanged. She appeared to have had a 180 degree flip in attitude when dealing with customers just a foot away from us. 5) When we were leaving - I paid the 15% tip that our server does not deserve and got up. She picked up the check and left the table only muttering a soft ""thanks"" again with no eye contact. We got up and walked out the door. No one said anything to us. No ""byes"" no ""thanks."" Nothing.As much as I enjoyed the food there, sub par service just does not fly anywhere. Maybe if you're lucky you'll get normal service as you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

Display shelves packed with rows of Japanese sake at the entrance, high wooden stools with majestic, proud wooden tables to the right, mock-sakura tree and a balanced centripetal synergy, accompanied by a stylish sushi bar in the main dining room.Service here is spectacular. From the coat check to the bartender to the server, you be sure to be greeted with warm smiles and Japanese level of respect for customers.Presentation is amongst some of the best I've ever seen. The salmon and rice comes out in a traditional clay pot, mixed table side with chunks of salmon and ikura (salmon roe). You can always experience cooking wagyu beef on a hot stone on your table. The plating for the whole sea bass is very pleasing to the eye, but not any better than the basket of freshly steamed veggies, colorfully assorted in a traditional bamboo steaming basket.That being said, it's a great place to take a date. However, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned and as agreed to by my table of guests, the actual food definitely does not match the standard of the setting. We had a table of good eaters so we tried every popular dish, every recommended dish, and then more, but nothing had a wow factor. The climax of every dish is actually when they bring it out. I so wish I could give this restaurant 5 stars, but my tummy said no. Pricing isn't terribly bad since we stuffed ourselves with almost every dish on the menu, along with cocktails and sake for only $120/person including tip!I typically would think the most essential factor in any restaurant is the food, but I loved the entire experience so much at En Japanese Brasserie, I will definitely return.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

The rice had seaweed bits and sesame seeds while the salmon was moist and tasty Cons:-I used to be a fan of restaurant week but after a series of disappointments, I don't think restaurant week is as good as it used to be in terms of service and food quality -the service was uncomfortably fast (right when we finished our appetizer, they took it away and gave our next item within a few seconds. It gave us a eat-and-get-out vibe)-no one told us what we were eating! They just gave us our food and walked away.

230,VWbNsTmlAMR714qPwkCUDQ,Nilsa L.,5.0 star rating,"I was excited to come here because I saw the reviews weren't that bad. Made a dinner reservation for 2 and when we got there it was pretty empty since it was still early in the evening. Like many Japanese restaurants, the staff greet you when you come in. I almost forgot about that tradition. So the atmosphere is nice. Everything is neatly placed on the table and the staff was very friendly. Upon arrival, you are given a towel to wipe your hands which is very nice. The only complain I have is that the chopsticks is the wooden one like the ones you get with your Chinese takeout. I think with a restaurant like this, we should have real chopsticks. So on to the food. We decided to go for the Restaurant Week menu and I was deciding on whether to add on an order of the black cod. The RW menu include homemade tofu, 2 chef's selection of appetizer, we both decided to get the salmon entree which also came with rice and miso soup, and then ice cream for dessert. The handmade tofu appetizer was ok. It wasn't strikingly great, but it does have tofu taste. Maybe because it was handmade, but I wish it was more delicate and smooth. The 2 chef's appetizers were a good starter even though I couldn't work out all of the ingredients in the dish. One had mushroom and daikon. The other had sprouts and some sort of meat or tofu, I wasn't sure but it tasted good. They were cold appetizers and it wasn't bad at all. Lots of flavor but not salty. Then the main course came. The salmon entree came with three gently fried salmon in a dash broth with mushroom, crab, and edamame. I don't recall tasting or seeing any mushroom or crab, but I liked the broth. By the middle of my entree, I was already thinking about black cod. I love black cod and decided to order it. What the heck; you gotta live a little! I was surprised that the dish came with two healthy portions of black cod. As soon as I had my first bite, I was in heaven. It was so flavorful, so buttery, with just the right amount of miso marinate. I was so full by the time I was done with the first piece, but I couldn't stop eating it. It was really THAT good. After the entree, we decided to stick with the restaurant week ice cream and not order any extra dessert. I was surprised and excited to know it's fig ice cream. I love fig and have never had fig ice cream. It was a small scoop but it was a nice end to the meal. Again, the ice cream had a good hint of fig flavor, but it wasn't overwhelming with artificial sweetness. If anything, I would go back just for the black cod. I would be a happy girl if I could get two orders of black cod and some rice.  As I'm writing this review, I am already craving for more.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Their salmon roe stone pot rice dish was beyond this world. Their food was indeed really delicious. The way their menu is set up is quite confusing and difficult to understand the portioning.

The Coffee and Zest was coffee, whiskey, lemon & orange zest with lavender, very interesting but not as delicious as the Local Honey. The Kuroge Washugyu salad was amazing perfectly coated with a light dressing and the cold meat was surprisingly tasty. I don't usually order chicken at restaurants but the Organic Stone Chicken is an absolute must after the Salmon Clay pot this was my favorite. Yes the wagyu was good but it isn't fulfilling. Wagyu in NYC is a novelty and is given sparingly. If you want wagyu go to Texas (that's where it all comes from anyway) and have yourself a full steak of it!  Anyway back to the chicken, it was so tender and moist, but the texture of the skin was the best part. The Salmon Clay Pot was the reason why I came here and I'd go back for it again, it was my favorite dish, simple but divine. Like I said, the wagyu was good, I didn't get enough of it, when it comes to wagyu I never do. I would recomend Wassan's wagyu as well as Sakai's over En's though. The Strawberry Panna Cotta was a perfect way to end the meal. Other honorable mentions are: Yama-imo isobe-age (yam and edamame), mochi croquette and black tea pudding.

We left our shoes at the sliding rice paper door to the tatami room, and sank into our low seats. My only complaint of the evening was the wooden disposable chopsticks (why do high-end Asian restaurants do this??). Otherwise, the service and meal timing was perfect, and we had a ball.On to the food. Everything we tried was strong, from the salad and appetizers to the heavy hitting chicken karaage (fried chicken) and black miso cod. The miso cod is one of the best examples in the city, and I don't know how they manage to make it soooo buttery in every bite. Each piece slowly melted on my tongue into a savory puddle of umami. The crunchy fried chicken was a highlight too. With the typical Japanese garnish of lemon, the citrus balanced the heaviness of the batter.

I made a reservation for me and mom Sunday evening for Mother's Day, which provided the occasion to finally check this place out after lusting over the menu for months.I ordered the Nohara set, which is vegan. My mom had the Soyo Kaze. Both menus are prix-fixe, seven-course dinners, made with seasonal ingredients. My first course came out looking absolutely beautiful; the Zensai plate had a bowl of EN's famous fresh scooped tofu, hijiki, among other creative preparations of sea vegetables. The smoked yuba tofu salad was served under a glass dome. The smoky flavor paired really nicely with the truffle soymilk dressing. The yaki nasu (grilled eggplant) was extremely flavorful and soft in texture and although the pickled vegetable sushi roll was one of the less inventive items, it was still tasty. I think my favorite course was the yasai kushiage, or vegetable tempura. Much to my excitement, the seasonal produce for this month featured multiple kinds of sweet potato. I love sweet potato and the variety of (perfectly fried) root vegetables came with a thick miso sauce that reminded me a little of barbecue. The final savory course was a rice and mushroom hotpot that cooked at the table for 20 minutes. Dessert consisted of two scoops of seasonal sorbet, which were raspberry and apple - very light and refreshing.Seven courses is a LOT of food, so I was absolutely stuffed at the end of my meal. I was kind of already stuffed by the tempura dish, but I couldn't bear to waste the rice pot or take it to-go when the fresh preparation was clearly the highlight. If I return to eat the prix-fixe again, I think I will *try* to ration my appetite and pack up a fraction of each course as I go, just so I can finish my dinner without feeling too full (and take leftovers home!).At $70, the price is steep, but extremely worth it for an occasion meal. Considering the quality of ingredients, service, the theatricality of the dishes, and the sheer quantity of food, I felt like the price reflected the experience nicely. The ambiance of the restaurant is really wonderful, too. The space is enormous and open, sharp and modern, accented with flower pieces. My mom and I both enjoyed the music playing all evening, too.

I won't belabor the night's dishes, except to say that the saikyo miso marinated grilled cod was extremely tender and had fully soaked in the savory flavor of the soy, and that the obansai dish, one of which was a creamy white miso and sesame dressing with asparagus and scattered sesame seeds, was very light and refreshing.The kisetsu no ice cream for the night was pumpkin, a flavor which required little imagination or thought on my part because quite frankly, I had no idea what pumpkin ice cream should've tasted like. But not to worry, the surprise flavor of the night was absolutely enjoyed as it was light enough to delightfully close our dinner, but substantial in flavor, both in its perfect touch of sweetness and dense enough texture, such that it wasn't forgettable.Additional dishes we ordered were the 15 piece sashimi (fresh!) and the green tea soba flan, which was quite wonderful. The matcha flavor was hard to miss, and when complexed with the texture of flan, came through very well. It wasn't too sweet, and so the taster really gets to fully appreciate the aroma of the tea.

Since the entire table's participation is required to get en kaiseki set menus, we alternated between the sets, with four people getting the Aozora and four people getting the Soyo Kaze. As set menus are supposed to showcase the best of the restaurant's dishes, you could say we had pretty high expectations. In addition, we also ordered the 21 piece assorted sashimi and oysters. Unfortunately, it seems that En Japanese Brasserie spends much more time and money on its presentation than its food. I would say that the part of the dinner that I enjoyed the most was the presentation - they tried really hard to make their food look creative (seeing your crab and rice cooked in a little pot in front of you, grilling the chicken on little metal trays at the table, cute mini bottle and straw for the matcha soy milk, and just generally well-thought-out details for each course), but the taste just did not match up. I've had better sashimi, I've had better lobster, better crab, and...better everything, to be honest. The rice in the crab dish was especially...boring, and I don't mean boring in a way that showcased the flavors of the crab. It was uninteresting, and I would say that my grandma cooks better crab than that. The tofu that En Japanese Brasserie is so well-known for was just okay. In all honesty, it felt that the food was catered to western tastes. Nothing felt elevated from what it normally was (again, the crab was just...crab?).The downside to their elaborate presentation is that the dinner took around four hours. I get not wanting to rush the customers, but we really didn't need those four hours for seven courses. There was a long wait between the first and second courses, and the third to last courses all came relatively quickly.The service was okay, but not amazing (though our host at the beginning was very nice about the alcohol situation since only half of our group had their licenses on them). The room was also smaller than I had thought it would be upon booking, but then I suppose that's my fault since I should've known NYC real estate prices wouldn't get us a super big room for $100. It did make it awkward for the servers to serve us though, and we had to try to avoid knocking them/the food over. In addition, I'm not sure if the door closes, but when booking, I had the impression that the room would be more secluded...or at least, you know, the door would be closed when food wasn't being brought into the room. We could hear all of the restaurant noise outside unfortunately.After dinner, it was a relief to leave so we could pick up cheap beer and onigiri from M2M.

I have never been to a fine dining restaurant that had such a hard time with proper salt and seasoning levels. We order two of their tasting menus along with several others dishes.

I know fine dining is usually on the smaller portion size but for a few of the dishes that were good (shabu-shabu) the portions were comically small. The single beef slice I repeat one beef slice, shaved so thin you could see through it. I am sorry to say but that is not a real course, especially when it is suppose to be the ""main"" course of the tasting menu.

I'm not sure why but the pictures did not seem to tempt me to come. Walking into this restaurant, it was very simple in terms of decor and the staff was very friendly. We came on a sunday night and the restaurant was empty because it was superbowl sunday. So besides our party, there was probably only 2 or 3 other tables with people eating. Upon opening the menu I asked the waitress for her recommendations and she didn't seem to have much knowledge of the menu. She pointed an item or two that she said was good but when i proceeded to ask for more details she was unable to provide me....i had to resort to yelp pictures to figure some stuff out! Totally unprofessional. But we ordered a few dishes to share because it seems like everything was tapas style and we'd probably need a couple of them to fill us up. We had the salmon roe rice which was probably the best thing on the menu and definitely the most worth it. It had such great flavors and the salmon roe in the rice gave your mouth a blast of flavor each time it popped. The cod was good....but its also the same cod you can get at any other japanese restaurant. The pork belly was really good and flavorful, and the meat was juicy and tender. We also had the tofu, but honestly it was nothing TOOO amazing....kind of flavorless in my opinion.

Nonetheless, EN Japanese Brasserie took me by surprise with their scrumptious and decent sized portions of their restaurant week dishes. Here's the menu:Appetizers: Handmade Tofu and O-Banzai1. No matter what you order for your entrée, these appetizers come with it by default. At first, I thought you have the option to choose either one but it turns out, you get both. Woot!2. The handmade tofu came in a cute squared wooden box and it was dipped in this soy miso sauce, which was quite delicious. I personally love tofu so I really enjoyed this one. 3. What is O-Banzai? The menu says ""chef's selection of two Kyoto-style appetizers."" Now what the heck does that mean? You may or may not be in for a surprise. If you're Asian, you probably had similar cold appetizers with tofu skin and mushrooms. To me, it's more of a Chinese-style appetizer. Entrée: Lobster Tempura or Grilled Washugyu (extra $13) or Mushi Yasai (veggie dish )1. All the entrées sounded really awesome so I ended up picking Lobster Tempura. Battered fresh lobster meat is a must try! Even though they gutted the meat from a small lobster, this dish alone was quite fulfilling.2. If you have the extra to spend, I would suggest try the Grilled Washugyu. Saw someone near our table ordered it and it smelled so good!Dessert: Black Sesame Ice creamI never had Black sesame ice cream but I think it has now become my second most favorite flavor right after green tea ice cream. However, this might be a no no for those who are self-conscious about sesame being stuck between their teeth. Overall, it was a great experience. It's definitely one of the better Restaurant week experiences I've had.

My hopes were relatively sky-high on this item.Everything else was wonderful. Especially the truffle with egg custard. Its preparation, presentation, and taste were memorable.

For a table of four, I would say we probably ordered a dish or two too many. That aside, there are some must-orders here. The beef salad to start is a very nice take on a ginger-dressed salad with thin cuts of beef. It's perfect for sharing between 2. The lobster ishiyaki was, in particular, a crowd favorite. I would stay away from the shrimp fritters - we all found them to be a bit of a gross/gelatinous texture and unfortunate flavor. But moving on... The garlic fried rice is a nice side to have throughout. And onto the finale, we all shared the buta shabu shabu, which basically changes your view on life. The spicy miso broth is absolutely mesmerizing. Despite having far exceeded comfort levels, I couldn't stop eating this soup. The nice thin pork loin/stomach cutlets cook quickly, and with a small bunch of the vegetables from the soup, every bite is perfect. I really can't say enough about this soup... I woke up the next morning thinking about it!I have to say that on top of the good food, we really had some amazing service.

We ordered the sake and shochu flights - very tasty and excellent presentation - another star for that.However where this place takes a nosedive is on the food itself. We ordered a ""chu toro spicy okaka"" roll and a sashimi sampler to start, and they bring out the most basic, low rent take out style spicy tuna roll I have ever seen. It tasted fine, no actual problems with it, but it was a $5 roll at best with a fancy name and a $21 price tag. The $36 9-piece sashimi sampler was mediocre at best - again not bad food, just rather basic and extremely small for what you pay.For the main course I got the Uni Don rice bowl and she had the Sea Trout. The uni don was a rather small portion and extremely slimy - it just mixed right into the rice - unacceptable for $29. The $20 Trout was at best a 2oz portion and should have barely qualified for an appetizer, let alone a main course - however it was very tasty and nicely seared.I am not sure if this place intentionally staggers the food, but I finished my Uni Don before my girlfriend's trout came out - we usually share anyway so it was not a big deal but just wanted to note it. My girlfriend and I have been to countless japanese restaurants on both ends of the price spectrum, and while this place was not the most expensive, it has by far the worst cost to quality ratio of any japanese, and possibly any restaurant we have ever been to.

Rather then the normal choice selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts, the only thing we chose from was the entrée. Normally this would be a big bummer for not being able to try a bunch of different things, but everything here was so awesome that if I had to share I would have been sad.For starters, we were given an appetizer of Handmade Tofu in a little wooden box. The flavor of the sauce and toppings were reminiscent of the wafu ramen I've had elsewhere. It was slightly fishy and 100% delicious. Next came two appetizers that I neither knew the names of or what they were composed of. The menu just says O-Banzai and describes it as a chef selection of Kyoto-style apps. They were both very good though.Next came the entrees. I ordered the Lobster Tempura and my girlfriend had the Stone Grilled Washugyu. My lobster tempura was plated quite nicely. It came with the shell of the half of the lobster that the meat had come from. Although I must say that was slightly disappointed when I flipped the shell over to find an empty carapace. They also added a Shishito Pepper Tempura with it and spice salt for dipping. The Stone Grilled Washugyu steak was amazingly good. Kobe strip steak? Hells yes! It came over a bed of scallions and the stone was so hot that any piece that was still too rare was cooked instantly. The entrees also came with Onigiri and Miso Soup on the side.For dessert, we had a scoop of Black Sesame Ice Cream. For lack of a better word, it too was AH-MAY-ZING! Just thinking about it now, I'm starting to crave some. Well, looks like I'm due for a trip to CICF after work.The food here was great. The wait staff here is also very friendly, patient and attentive. I never had to ask for water refill and happily obliged to my request of lemon wedges.

EVERYTHING IS FREAKING FANTASTIC!!!I personally love uni, and particularly preferred the Santa Barbara one out of the three samples (Japan and Maine being the other two). But it's a great experience to taste the difference of the sea urchins from different parts of the world. My husband is a steak guy, and he had his fair share of good steaks, but according to him, nothing compare to wagyu beef. The evenly distributed marble of fat in between the meat makes the beef so tender and melts in your mouth. The waitress explained to us that they feed the cows with beer, give them massages daily, and walk them like pets...... and into the slaughter house.Then the cod. OH, THE COD!!! I wanted to harass the chef for the recipe. Just get it, and you won't regret it. Even if you are allergic to cod, get it! It's worth it!On the side note, the drinks are delicious as well.

And in fact, EN probably rivals the best meal I had in Kyoto. I normally try to keep my yelp review short--just touching on the best parts. But since everything we ate was noteworthy, this review may be long. First, while waiting for our table, we had cocktails at the bar. Simply put, they were delicious. They were also strong!We ordered the $65 nine dish tasting menu, with the $35 alcohol pairings. My girlfriend claimed that the salmon sashimi topped her all time list of favorite pieces of sashimi. This scooped tofu left us raving for the next 12 hours. Yes, I agree, how can tofu be worth talking about for 12 hours. But EN managed to make it worthy. I loved the black cod. In this case, the trite expression holds true: the cod melted in my mouth. The chicken arrived still cooking on a hot stone plate. When dipped into the accompanying sauce, what at first appeared to be simple chicken transformed into a five star worthy dish. Despite the fact that I don't like dessert, or or ice cream, the strawberry dessert tasted amazing, and went well with the delicious plum wine.Overall, we really enjoyed the alcohol pairing. My girlfriend did not like her first shochu, (similar to Vodka, but only 14%) though I ended up very much enjoying both mine and hers. The restaurant was happy to substitute her second shochu for a sake that she was happy with, despite not normally being a huge fan of sake.With the high ceilings and tree in the center, the atmosphere impressed us.

Waiter: Relatively timely and very watchful about not letting the water reach the bottom of the glass. I was even impressed with the water, you can really taste how filtered and clean it is. Our waiter was very friendly, helpful, and informative with the menu.Food:The Agedashi tofu and black cod were amongst the best dish to eat. They were both  highly mentioned and recommended and without a doubt a good recommendation. The agedashi tofu was light, did not have too much flavor, the mushroom soy sauce was cooked to perfection with an easy texture to eat. The black cod was a delicious, perfectly cooked fish but be aware of any small bones. The clay rice pot was another delicious dish as well. The salmon was fatty with some fish eggs changed the texture and flavor of the dish.I slightly regret ordering the donuts over the icecream sandwich. I felt the donut was not sweet enough, it was slightly bitter but the icecream made it sweeter. It was a good balance of something really hot and cold but it lacked a little extra flavor and taste.

380,nhJc3hqllASqxwoVY6Ar1A,Serena T.,3.0 star rating,"EN Japanese Brasserie, located in the West Village, offers freshly made Japanese cuisine in a cavernous, trendy space.  Known for its housemade tofu, this restaurant takes pride in its seasonal ingredients and ever-changing menu.  I recently visited EN for dinner with an eating buddy, where we sampled several dishes.The menu offered quite a few selections - we started with the freshly made scooped tofu, served warm with wari-joyu.  If you've never had freshly made tofu before, I would highly, highly, recommend it.  The texture is smooth as silk and unlike anything you can get pre-made. The flavor is delicate and light. The wari-joyu, which is a mix of soy sauce and fish broth, provided a subtle enhancement to this already pristine dish. Yum!We also ordered the corn chawanmushi  - for the uninitiated, chawanmushi is steamed egg custard; really delicious!  The corn and rich broth provided a sweet counterpoint to the smooth, eggy custard.  My only complain was that the tiny wooden spoon wasn't nearly large enough. I would have gladly used a serving spoon for that custard!Anything with a poached egg in it calls out to me, so of course we had to order the hicken tsukune - grilled Japanese-style chicken sausages served with a poached egg. This was delicious, especially with the runny yolk spread all over the chicken sausage and the sweet, tangy sauce.The Mochi Croquette also caught my eye, since it had two ingredients I love - mochi and duck!  The dish also included potato and was served in a hearty dashi broth. This definitely was not what I expected - when I think of a croquette, I imagine something breaded and fried.  Though this dish didn't resemble the traditional croquette, it was flavorful, chewy and delicious. The broth was hearty and the mochi soaked up all the flavors perfectly.To accompany our dishes, we ordered the EN Garlic Shiso Fried Rice. The garlic and shiso flavors were strong but not overwhelming, and the rice just right - not too mushy and not too crunchy.If you're looking for delicious Japanese cuisine in a trendy atmosphere, give EN Japanese Brasserie a try.  I docked one apple because the prices are a little high, but that won't stop me from going again (maybe not every week though, ha).  Perfect for a nicer night out!",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

My friend and I got the Kobe beef for the main entree.  Unfortunately, they made you pay $12 ON TOP OF THE $35 for the Restaurant Week menu, so I thought this made the meal unnecessarily expensive.  The beef dish came out on a stone slab with the meat still sizzling -- my friend told me that if you get this dish normally (not RW) you actually get to cook the raw meat yourself.  I thought the meat was very chewy and tender.  You can pair it with some salt or soy sauce-like-sauce to add some flavor.Lastly, we both got the sesame ice cream.  It was actually really good!  It tasted kind of like green tea ice cream, but it had the smoky sharp flavor of the sesame seeds.  I really liked it and wish I could hunt down where they get the ice cream.Lasting thoughts: this place's food is pretty good, and the atmosphere is very romantic here, but be prepared to spend $50+ on dinner here (if you get 3 courses)",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

386,oDpcZFyArgbiTdvrZFzlvA,Jenny C.,2.0 star rating,"2.5 stars to be exact.I LOVE Japanese food. And I have been wanting to come here for the longest time. But  alas, En let me down. I came here for a nice dinner date on my birthday and ordered a variety of dishes. I had the grilled black cod, homemade tofu, gyu tan, watercress salad with soymilk dressing, and black sesame mochi doughnuts (sorry I forgot the names of the dishes). Anyways, since it's better to start with bad news... The Bad:The miso black cod was absolutely depressing!!!! My heart was broken and no I'm not exaggerating. This is my most favorite fish to eat and it was cooked very poorly. What a waste of good fish. :( The fish was under grilled and didn't taste very fresh. It had a sort of hard texture and what was supposed to be a soft, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth dish became bland, dry, and fishy. Just remembering this makes me want to cry or reprimand the ""chef"" who made this. Because really, it is such a novice mistake that could have been easily avoided if the said ""chef"" cared about what he/she was making. Such a lack of regard reflects very poorly of the kitchen staff. An under-cooked dish like this should not have made it to the table.  The beef tongue was pretty bland too. Didn't really have any sauce nor was it marinated or anything. So meh. The Okay:Salad was interesting with the tofu skin blanket and soymilk dressing. Never had that kind of dressing before so it was worth the try. But I felt like it was missing something to cut the bitterness of the salad since watercress is a pretty bitter green when eaten on its own. It wasn't bad, but neither was it really good.The Good:Their homemade tofu was amazing! Very very very good. You can have it either hot or cold, I chose hot. The tofu was so smooth and silky and the soymilk it produced was deliciously naturally sweet. I love tofu and this is THE BEST tofu I've ever had!! Desert was pretty good too.Sadly, the tofu was not enough to leave a good impression. For the price, I expected better main dishes and better quality check. Especially for the black cod.

The drinks were deeelish. Oh! We also had the house made scooped tofu. Like many of the other reviews, it was great.The second time, my uncle got the sashimi lunch set and I got the kuroge washugyu yaki shabu...it was heavenly.

Not a big fan of the ginger on top though. It's quite possibly to accentuate certain tones of the tofu (really? I dunno, how much flavor can you get outta tofu anyway??) but it didn't sit well with me and I had to push it aside. Dishes of little appetizers tasted weird, especially the eggplant with bonito flakes. The daikon was better but not very flavorful. The grilled lobster was excellent. Loved the sauce it came with and the cute little taro chunks were tasty too, albeit on the bland side. A dish of rice came with the entree but it was sort of cold so I left that alone. Black sesame ice cream was creamy but not heavy. It was ok at best, nothing to be amazed about.

Service ****A little slow, however, spot on for everything else.  Dislikes - the noise factor.  definitely not a DATE environment.Likes - Minus the noise factor, it's a really pretty, upscale, cultural setting.  Absolute beautiful food presentation.  Forewarning, it will make you feel like you have to eat all of your meals in small bites-which is perfectly fine with me.... that's how I roll....Tips - Don't sit by the bar away from where the chefs prepare the food.  It's a horrible seating & view... not to mention DARK!Overall: I liked it...but I didn't love it.  I think I loved the decor more than I did the actual food here..... but chance tells me I will be able to give it another shot!",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

401,-Ta9oXdYnd408Sn5bUeaqQ,Margaret S.,5.0 star rating,"This has hands-down been one of my best dining experiences in NYC. A restaurant that feels hip and serves amazing food, but somehow seems to have stayed under the radar among the ""restaurants to try"" lists. They have a great selection of saki--if you're like me and have only ever had sake in the form of a sake bomb, you need to try real sake here. Also an amazing selection of French wine--likely where the ""Brasserie"" factor comes into play. Be warned that the food servings are all very small--this is like tapas-style Japanese food. I was here with 3 other friends, and we went the route of ordering lots of dishes to share. The O-Banzai (small Kyoto style dishes) are good starters, but be warned that they're cold. We got the Goma Ae (broccoli and cauliflower in sesame dressing), Shira Ae (brussell sprouts with Japanese sweet potato and tofu dressing) and Hijiki (seaweed with snowpeas and soy beans).  The Goma Ae and Shira Ae were flavorful, but the Hijiki was rather uninspired. Each portion probably had 6 bites total, but great for sharing if you all just want a taste. For our main, we got the Lobster Ishiyake--stone-grilled lobster--that was served on a hot stone.  Decently flavorful, but very little meat for the price. We also split 2 types of sushi; the Chu Toro Spicy Okaka is a glorified spicy tuna roll (although that's my favorite kind of sushi so I wasn't too disappointed) but the Tofu & Avocado roll was amazing. I never thought I'd have sushi that was complex, but this had so many harmonizing flavors that took the entire meal up a knotch in my book. The real winner of the meal was the Mochi Croquette; when we ordered it we were expecting something that looked like a standard croquette, but instead received a mochi mound within a broth. We weren't entirely sure what we were eating--the description included duck--but it was amazing. Definitely a hidden and underrated gem on the menu. Desserts were out of this world. I'm not normally a huge fan of dessert, but the black sesame ice cream was unlike anything I had ever tasted (in the best way). The fig ice cream was a close runner-up.

402,lkI0r8HccX-uZQkgcQWj-w,Sherry L.,4.0 star rating,"I work right by EN and only recently have I discovered its awesomeness. I went once for lunch back in December and another time for dinner about 2 months ago (yes, this review is late...).First of all, let me say: I love tofu. I almost can't get enough of the stuff! I usually can't find very good, freshly made tofu unless it's in Asia (omg the yudofu in Kyoto and the homemade tofu in my hometown of Tianjin makes my mouth water!). But when I heard that EN makes its own fresh tofu all day long, I dragged a few co-workers for lunch on a cold winter day.EN has some nice lunch specials - a little pricey for a normal day but totally worth it for a splurge! We went right before New Years so they had the mochi bashing... thing (?) at the entrance and my friend took a picture of me (that was fun haha).Anyway, the food! The tofu was nothing less of amazing. The 3 of us shared 1 order of the warm tofu served with wari-joyu, which is a sauce made from ponzu, soy sauce (I think) and other magical stuff. The big chunk of tofu came in a square wooden box emerged in some soy milk. You should've seen the look on my face, I was as excited as a kid on Christmas Day!The tofu was warm but not hot, and I could tell it was made with great care and precision. I remember my grandfather telling me about the tofu-ing process and I remembered something about careful timing and some precise chemical reactions. In other words, if you screw up, you don't get tofu.. you get something else. But EN made my day with their tofu. It was soft with this distinct tofu taste. Yes, tofu does have its own taste, believe or not! You usually don't taste it because it's not fresh tofu, which is probably why there's still such an aversion to this amazing food.The rest of lunch was pretty awesome. I got the miso cod, which was cooked perfectly. The meat was flaky and tender, and completely without the stink of fishiness. My friend got the karaage. Both of ours came with another thing of tofu - which I don't need to tell you how happy it made me.When I went back to dinner a couple of months ago, I knew I just HAD to try the Uni Ikura Don. I love Uni and I love rice bowls. EN is slightly on the pricey side but imagine my surprise when I saw my dish! It was HUMONGOUS! A heaping and generous portion of Uni with an also geenrous dallop of Ikura and fresh wasabi on top. The bright orange of the Uni and Ikura was subdued with a sprinkle of finely cut nori around and over the rice.This dish was definitely worth my 25 bucks! There was so much Uni! Both the Uni and the Ikura were very fresh, which you don't get unless you know the restaurant gets enough customers to keep restocking this stuff. The sweetness of the Uni was well balanced with the saltiness of the Ikura. The textures were also well matched, as the Uni was Ikura's oily interior (for lack of a better word) blended richly with the soft Uni.Wow, writing this review really made me hungry!

I would say..it s one of the best places to have a lunch.It s not a traditional size of Izakaya, but it s still decorated in a well-designed Japanese style. I enjoy the atmosphere, and I think it s a good choice to come with either friends or colleagues. What I had?Freshly scooped tofu:We were all extremely pleased by this dish. It s very smooth, but not too soft. You can feel it melts in your mouth, but you can still enjoy the bite and the taste. The tofu was served with a home-made wari-joyu sauce, which is not regular a soy sauce, but also mixed with water and other seasonings. It s certainly a MUST try in the restaurant. My aunt brings me to the restaurant, and she said the tofu there is one of the reasons she missed NYC.We also had four different small plate appetizers..They are traditional Japanese appetizers, light and refreshing. They were all a quite small size, but I think the size of an order is perfect. You enjoy it, and you think of it next time. unfortunately..I dont remember any name of them.

The service was great (but a bit confusing as tons of people kept coming to our table so it was difficult for my boyfriend to order a beer and get in a timely manner since there was probably miscommunication between the staff).My boyfriend and I split a tasting menu (consisted of sushi, 3 small sides, cold tofu, cold noodles, delicious cod, chicken on a hot plate, ice cream). We tried the edamame and a bit of my sister's pork belly. My sister's boyfriend ordered a decanter of sake which he loved (and thought the wealth of options on the menu was great). Everything was very good. My boyfriend and I were still hungry (after we realized I had ordered incorrectly and he didn't intend to split the tasting menu but to order 1 each), we ordered a small size of sushi - so delicious! Our waitress felt bad about the miscommunication so she gave us complimentary homemade chips (yummy!) and covered the sake. It was very very nice of her (and the entire waitstaff) since it was really my fault to begin with.For dessert, we tried some of the ice cream (tangerine, green tea, black bean, and one other flavor) all of which were very good.Would recommend this place to anyone who loves small plates, fresh great food, a great ambience, and of course a waitstaff that actually cares about their patrons!",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Chef Abe Hiroki offers a modern approach, not only offering traditional sushi but also cooked dishes: Saikyo Miso Black Cod, and Washugyu steak. It's a fine restaurant; jut not a must-visit restaurant, in my opinion given how expensive it is.Ambiance: The interior is dark, large and cavernous; I like the vibe. I am a stickler for detail and there is one that I would have thought that given the price point, management would have gotten right. The seat level of the benches are significantly higher than the seat heights of the chairs. So, typically the woman sits on the inside on the bench, then she towers over the man joining her. A little detail, but one worth fixing. Also, although I am tall (6'2""), I am not gigantic so chairs and tables should fit me. I was disappointed that I was unable to sit at the table without my knees lifting up the table. Yes, En has short table legs. Food: Top notch and you really can't go wrong. But, be prepared for a hefty bill. Everything is expensive. Service: Gets the job done. Can't complain, but also can't rave about it.Drinks: - There are very good options for wine by the bottle and by the glass and excellent options for sake. En does Saki really well offering an extensive list of small-batch, artisanal sake and shochu.

EN has adopted a similar concept, but instead they've modernized it and made it as classy as possible. I've been here for lunch and dinner before, and everything is presented beautifully and in the freshest state. Most recently I came in with my friend Jodi for the set menus. There are two types of set menus (kaiseki), the Soyo Kaze ($65/person) and the Aozora ($90/person). We decided to each get a different one and share everything. There are 7 courses to each menu. You can find all the details for each course on their website, but here were the ones that stood out. Note: The menu elements do change from time to time depending on season, which is awesome!Lightly Seared Tuna with Ponzu sauce - this tuna was amazing. So delicious, and seared perfectly. The Ponzu wasn't too salty, and was light enough to give flavor but without overpowering the delicate fish. Saikyo Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod - the cod melts in your mouth and the flavor of the fish is just amazing. The miso flavor is so fragrant and compliments the fish PERFECTLY!Freshly Scooped Tofu - amazing. This is not the stuff you buy in stores. It's naturally sweet, had a mild flavor, but the texture is amazing. Saikyo Miso Foie Gras and Filet (USDA Prime Filet) - the fois gras is SO good. The filet is grilled amazingly so that it's got that delicious crust, but so tender in the inside. DROOL! Stone Grilled Organic Chicken - this comes with garlic shoyu for dipping. The stone is kickass, and it makes the chicken incredibly hot when it comes to the table, but the chicken itself is cooked tenderly. I usually avoid eating the skin, but here it's too good to resist. One of the dishes for each set is also sashimi. I gave poor Jodi both of the dishes to finish off, and she said that they were incredibly fresh. She tried fresh sweet shrimp sashimi for the first time here, and she said it was daunting but tasted spectacular. We each also had a noodle 6th course. I believe we each had two types of soba, one was green tea, while the other was regular buckwheat with uni on top. We were stuffed so we asked our waitress if we could pack it home. She said ""Of course, but it will not have its ideal flavor"". She said it in the gentlest way, but we had mad respect for her encouraging us to eat each dish in its prime moment. Each of the menus also has an option to pair sake and shochu ($35-45 additional), which is quite a bit of booze for 7 courses. Overall, AMAZING service too. We were never left unattended and they timed each course amazingly well. We were never waiting for food, and everything was brought out FRESH and with impeccable presentation.

She tried to up sell things at every corner, and that's just not cool. In fact, that's very un-Japanese like! (I don't think she was Japanese... some other Asian). Anyway. I made a rez easily online. They seated us promptly, and this time they seated us at in the big dining room- which is a nicer area than the front. We sat around the center piece. From the get-go, the waitress (look out for her! With black, thick rimmed glasses) asked us two times if we wanted cocktails. I don't drink, and bf doesn't like cocktails. Yet, she still goes on to describing the refreshing cocktails... no thanks. Then we dives into the specials. Which is fine- happy to hear about them. But we've been here before and I knew what we wanted to order. I don't know if she was trying to pitch us for our naivete? She went on and on about the kobe beef steaks, which were some 100 per piece. That might have even been ok except I DON'T EAT BEEF! I even joked, sorry you wasted your breath because I don't eat beef (and she looked mad!). Then she went into how they just had truffles flown in from Italy! Man this chick is craaazy! We ordered:1) O Bonzi (3 app sampler)- asparagus on some kind of tofu paste? Maybe?, this was chilled, and good (nothing wowza, though), the fern sprouts- which were interesting albeit a little bitter and almost TOO cold, and the pork belly with lotus root. I liked the crunchy taste of lotus root, but was disappointed the pork belly wasn't the crispy kind, with lots of fat. I felt like I ate pork for nothing. My bf said this was the best one though. - $162) Of COURSE, the hand made freshly scooped tofu- warm (you can choose cold, I suggest warm). This made TONY 2011's 100 best dishes of NY. I think this seriously might be one of my favorite things to eat of all time. Made every couple hours, the tofu is milky, soft, flavorful- and filling. If you love tofu, get this!  You don't even need the soy sauce it comes with! -$8 (?) Wow great value.3) Crispy Fried Chicken - a filling alternative to the stone grilled, and heavy. Made with boneless chicken thighs, the batter is perfection and it's salty- in a good way. Great with the lemon. Perfect crispy but juicy on the inside. -$164) The Warm Soba Noodles with duck broth- I have to say I liked this the least. Mainly because the broth didn't taste like duck at all - no duck fat, just very scallion-y (not a fan). My bf said it was like miso. The soba themselves did not taste very hand made. Meh. - $16Rest assured, bf and I were full. EXCEPT the waitress warned she'd leave a menu because ""we didn't order enough food for two"". Oh trust, we were so full! Needless to say, we didn't want dessert, because we were full! But, if I was eye-ing the flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. Total came to $55, but after deal, it was like $15 some dollars. Waitress didn't sneer too badly about deal. Aside from pushiness, the service was fine, albeit the soba came out way later than the rest of the stuff but that's due to proper pacing them.

However, we found plenty of cooked dishes for me to enjoy in the end (although it was a torture watching them eating those beautiful sashimi slices). With that said, this review is based on some of those cooked dishes I had. Their miso black cod and special salmon collar were delicious, but the yellow tail collar in the pepper-soy sauce vinaigrette was disappointing. Homemade tofu is great as usual, but the samba noodles with duck breast was pretty bland. The seafood pot cooked with sake-kasu broth was highly recommended but tasted just okay to me. Others, however, seemed to have really enjoyed it. I did like the stone grilled wanyu beef, but too bad I had to let it sizzle to medium this time.  Overall, I wasn't too too impressed with all those cooked dishes I've tried here, but still decent enough. The highlight of my night was still dessert. Loved both the fig and black sesame ice cream. Fig is definitely their specialty and black sesame I just simply love.

We enjoyed everything as they were light but packed with great flavor. We had beef for dinner which was cooked well and hit my meat craving just fine.

He recommended 3-4 dishes per person. We ended up getting 2.5 each and that was plenty. To start with, they have a huge drink list of different sakes. I got the sparkling sake which was actually 2 glasses and very sweet. The cocktail with sake, club soda, and lime was amazing. We got many of them throughout the dinner. The hits:  The black miso cod was the best dish of the night. The homemade tofu was delicious with the sauce they provided, we got it warm per the waiter's recommendation.  I loved the mushroom and soy milk hot pot, it was a ridiculously huge portion of mushrooms. The salad with mushrooms and chicken was a big portion and lightly dressed. The misses: the sea urchin dish was not good, but I've heard that the urchin is a very strong taste. The salmon sashimi was very fresh, but I thought it was overpriced. The salmon clay pot was recommended by the waiter. It comes out as a big pot filled with rice and salmon, a server then breaks up the salmon and mixes it with the rice. It comes with little bowls of roe and an herb.

461,UaVJmBu96uUJNJfe58Z0sg,Sandy C.,4.0 star rating,"My friend asked me if I want to try some ""fish heads, eel bones and beer."" And I gave him a stare as if he's out of his mind and I nervously said ""sure...""This type of food is only served the first Saturday of each month from 10PM-11:30PM, so reservations may be hard to come by. But I guess he was lucky and was able to get reservations during the day for that night. We've arrived at the restaurant and it was a cloud of confusion. The hostess asked us if we were there for the Makanai, a Japanese kitchen tradition that demonstrates both cooking skills and the wise use of inventory remainders in feeding the staff or in other words curious people like us. And yup that is exactly why we were there and she directed us to go straight to the bar.At this point I was still confuse. Why aren't we getting seated at a table, but rather lining up by the counter to get our food as if this was some sort of very fancy soup kitchen? Turns out this is how it works, it is like a family style buffet type of dinner. Which was pretty interesting. So the bartender gives each person a glass for their unlimited refills of Sapparo and you look for a seat in the communal tables.*You simply line up, pick up a dish and fight for all you can eat food - you know the whole buffet drill. I kid. That is not how it works, everyone there were so friendly and lined up in an orderly way and waited for their turn. First dish I came across were their tofu. The tofu was just okay. I like my tofu either fried or in a very smooth substance preparation. Or even better, give me some syrup and I make ""tofufa"", this Chinese sweet tofu dessert. mMm would love to have some right now...Second is the udon noodle salad in light broth. If you are like me, who can't use chopsticks properly, no worries! They provide you with proper serving utensils, so you would not make a fool out of yourself having noodles fly all over the place, especially while trying to impress that special someone.  The noodles was served cold, but I liked it very much. It was pretty light to taste. Following dish was the chicken katsu, which was pretty nicely breaded. But it wasn't really one of the highlights of that night's dinner. Honestly, I can get chicken katsu in many Japanese restaurants or even in Chinese owned restaurants that serves Japanese food. Til today I still don't quite get it, why is it that so many sushi restaurants are owned by Chinese people? Next up is the Chirashizushi, which is a bowl of rice with scattered sashimi, shredded seaweed and sesame. Hmmm...I did say sashimi, but why is it each time I went to get another serving all I see left is the seaweed, sesame and lots of rice? Oh wait, if I looked carefully, I see a smidge of sashimi. So I guess it was a little aggressive when it came to this dish, everyone else stripped the sashimi off this bowl of rice. But that's okay I like the seaweed and sesame any way, so that means more for me. But luckily they always bring out new batches when supplies are low and I finally got to have some of the sashimi. This dish was pretty good, I liked it. But I think I was getting full from just the rice alone, yet it was still very good!Then it was the highlight of the night - crunchy deep fried eel and fluke bones. Wow, these were amazingly delicious! I couldn't help it, but every time I went back to refill my plate, I would skip everything else and go straight to this dish. Each bite was crunchy until the last bite. It was full of flavor. Who knew fried eel and fluke bones would taste so good? Next in line is the sake-marinated whole roasted tuna collar, but every time I go up to get more food, all I see are bones. Argh, those aggressive fish eaters didn't save any for me! I remembered my mother always told me to eat more fish, while I was growing up. Now I want fish, but there's no more and I had to scrape off scraps of meat from between each little bone and put together a dish of fish for myself. I think the server pitied me and they brought out a new untouched dish all just for me! Yay! Poor me didn't have to scrape for pieces of meat any longer and can use my poor chopstick skills to get slabs of fish meat piled on my plate. The fish was pretty good with a subtle taste of sake.Last but not least, it was the fish head soup. The broth was very flavorful and infused with the taste of fish. No, not that fishy smell from fish markets, but rather a very rich fish oil kind of taste. When they said fish head soup, they were not kidding, it was the real deal because occasionally I would need to spit up some fish scales.*If you can't find a seat at the communal tables by the bar area for the Makanai, do not panic. There are more tables on the left side from the hostess by the main entrance.P.S. - Good luck balancing a glass of Sapparo, a plate of food, a bowl of fish head soup, juggling a napkin, holding a spoon with your nose and clenching a pair of chopsticks between your teeth.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I spent $34 (including tax+tip) on my own entree, plus sharing the restaurant's homemade tofu and two desserts with three other friends. When my friends suggested getting the freshly scooped tofu as an appetizer, I admit I was hesitant. It's tofu. How unique/good can it be? How silly of me. Of course it's not going to be like the tofu you buy already packaged and cold in the supermarket. This tofu was still warm (they make several batches a day), silky soft, and had a slightly nutty flavor. A fairly hefty portion too! It was perfect as a shared appetizer. Perhaps because I've grown up with Korean food, I got a lunch box set with various side dishes.

Cooks make magic even with humble ingredients like fish heads, bones, vegetable peels, and scraps of rich wagyu beef, turning them into delicious, irresistible dishes. But not dishes for the customers--foods for the cooks themselves. These wondrous restaurant-family meals, called makanai, have inspired EN's Chef Hiroki Abe to cook a lustrous tasting menu of tasty treats rarely found on a Japanese restaurant menu. Walking into the restaurant to confirm my reservation, the hostess told me to go to the bartender and tell her my name.  The makanai I found out, wasn't served in the restaurant proper but was hosted  instead in the bar area in the very front before entering the main dining room.  Upon giving my name, the bartender gives me a tall empty glass for each person I made reservations for.  This is what you use throughout the night for unlimited refills of Sapporo beer.  Indeed. I said unlimited refills.  It is included as part of the meal.The website advertises the dinner as ""family style"" which had me thinking that they would bring big plates of each dish to our table and everyone in our party would share it.  Instead, the family style part is more about the communal tables that you share with other patrons while eating.  Food wise, it is more proper to call it a all you can eat buffet where you go up and get as much food as you want for as many times as you want.  They constantly brought out new batches of the food as each one is running low throughout the night.The dishes served were:Deep fried eel and fluke bones.  These were deep fried, flavorful, and very crunchy.  Couldn't stop eating these.  They were like the snack-able chips provided at some restaurants but much better.Roasted magura tuna collar were really popular with the diners. Every time time they brought this out, everyone picked the meat clean to the bone very quickly. These are giant pieces of collars from the tuna and was surprisingly meaty.  The meat has a subtle taste of sake and miso with each bite.The Chirashi was created from sushimi grade raw fish meat odds and ends along with various bits of fish roe and sprinkles of roasted sesame seeds mixed on top of a bed of rice.  Pour in a bit of the provided soy sauce and the Chirashi was simply delicious.  Only thing about this dish is that the other patrons loves to take mostly the sashimi parts and leave tons of rice behind.  What a waste.The fish soup was amazing.  Just think of your favorite miso soup but even lighter, clearer and enhanced with the extra flavors provided from the fish meat used while cooking the soup.Udon noodles salad in a light broth.  I believe the broth is mirin and soy sauce based and provides a nice light flavor to the soft udon and various vegetables mixed in.  This was served cold and was very refreshing.Chicken Katsu.  This was a very competent  version of a well known dish.  Nice meaty chicken pieces breaded and fried with a thick sauce provided to pour to taste.  Not too special compared to the rest of the dishes that I've mentioned already though.Firm tofu in sweet syrup.  Some of my dining companions liked this but I found it a bit too bland.  I also personally prefer a more lighter and silkier tofu when mixed with any kind of sweet syrup.  This was my least favorite dish of the night.Some of the dishes changes each month so not everything I mentioned here would be available for the next makanai.  They rotate the selection each month depending on what they have available at the time.  I believe the tuna collar and the eel & fluke bones might be two of the consistent dishes on the menu each time as it's part of the meal's name.  I really wish they had the wagyu beef that was mentioned on the website since I heard some very good things about it but I guess it leaves something to possibly look forward to the next time I decide to do this again.Towards the end of the makanai,at 11:10 exactly, the staff tells everyone that is still interested to get their last refill of the Sapparo, which we did, and we happily hung out for another half an hour just chatting and relaxing.  After our stomachs had time to rest a bit we walked away still stuffed but happy that we got to experience this.P.S.  Apparently the makanai attracts a very Asian crowd of foodies.  When we were there, I would say a good 80% or so of the diners were Asians including our group.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

O-BANZAI (kuroge washugyu shabu shabu salad, snow crab & asparagus shira ae and odashi tomato with a tosazu gelée) - These three appetizers were very different from each other and altogether a good start to the meal. The Washugyu beef was barely seasoned so you could really taste the flavor of the meat. The skinned tomato was really fresh and the tosazu gelée was an interestingly tart accompaniment. The snow crab and asparagus was the most ""normal"" appetizer; it was like a seafood salad.yelp.com/biz_photos/P_UR…CHEF'S CHOICE SASHIMI (seven piece sashimi selection) - YUUUMMMM I salivate just thinking about EN's sashimi.

Thankfully the moromi miso was put mostly on the side so I could avoid it. yelp.com/biz_photos/P_UR…CHA SOBA (chilled buckwheat and green tea soba noodles from Shizuoka, Japan served with tsuyu) - Wow this was delicious.

The seating is low and comfortable, and I hear they have a tatami room here as well.I got the Himawari Kaiseki, which I would suggest over the more expensive kaiseki because the Himawari is more like what you would find in a traditional Japanese izakaya.HIMAWARI KAISEKI:1. O-Banzai: Kiriboshi Daikon, Zenmai Piri-Kara, and Hijiki. The hijiki and zenmai piri-kara were my two favorites, and each of the three dishes was a perfect appetizer to the start of the kaiseki.2. Sashimi - two pieces each of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna. The fish was fresh and very yummy. I normally don't like yellowtail, but my opinion was changed here.3. Saikyo Miso Marinated Black Cod - there's a reason why so many people rave about this dish, and that's because it is AMAZING. It's soft, tender, and flakes right off. 4. Freshly Chilled Scooped Tofu - I'm very picky about my tofu, and if it's not silky, I won't eat it. I ate the entire bowl. The wari-jiyo was a perfect complement.5. Kurobuta Kakuni - I normally really like pork belly, but I wasn't too crazy about it here. The small drop of Japanese mustard really overwhelmed everything.6. Tenobe Somen - the perfect end to the main portion of the meal. Chilled noodles with a light enough tsuyu to clean the palate and refresh yourself.7. Peach sorbet - AMAZING. It's seasonal, and you couldn't find fresher peach chunks in here. Intense, simple, and smooth.The rest of my family also ordered a couple other dishes to share, and I have to say, I'm very impressed.1. Warm Freshly Made Scooped Tofu - as good as the chilled, if not better. Their wari-jiyo is just PERFECT. Soy milk can be drank as well.2. Gomu Dofu Age Dashi - two sesame and two regular tofu. Intense sesame flavor without being overpowering. The dashi broth is great! Save it for some rice if you get any.3. Unagi no Shirayaki - if there is one dish you need to order from EN, THIS IS IT. Live eel flown overnight from Shizuoka, this is the best eel I've ever had in the states. Grilled to perfection, it's tender, smooth, and tasty.4. Saikyo Miso Black Cod - the parents liked mine so much, they got their own.5. Stone Grilled Kuroge Washugyu - Japanese black angus rib eye that you grill on a hot stone yourself! It's so delicious, and so fun. Definitely recommend this.6. Jyogokokumai Rice Pot - fifteen grain rice. Arrived at the table in this awesome, huge pot! It was okay though, and sort of bland to eat on its own.Pretty much everything was a hit, and the chef(s) has great control over that grill. I applaud him.For desserts, we got Flourless Chocolate Cake with Green Tea Ice Cream and the Soba Tea Pudding. What's great is that the kitchen takes time to CHILL the dishes, so your ice cream isn't half melted by the time it arrives at the table!The chocolate cake and green tea ice cream are perfect contrasts to each other - one icy cold, and the other piping hot (I burned myself touching the bowl).The soba tea pudding was unique in that it isn't a traditional sweet dessert. It has a layer of caramel on top, but it's the perfect dessert for anyone without a sweet tooth.For drinks, we had non-alcoholic fresh pineapple juice with ginger and homemade ginger ale with lime. The pineapple juice was great!

And my experience is a bit complicated:4.5- star for the environment - very spacious, comfortable seating;3.5-4 star for the food - 3.5 star for the taste and 4 start for the presentation;the reason i gave it a 2 is all because of an freshly squeezed pineapple juice...I ordered a nonalcoholic pineapple juice, but didn't specify with ice or not. So when I got my pineapple juice in a small cocktail glass, it was full of ice. So had a sip, it tasted a bit water down...so i told the waitress the same and ask if i can get rid of the ice...and a couple mins after...the waitress came back and gave me a 1/4 full glass of pineapple juice...no joke...exactly how much you see in my attached picture....My friends and I were laughing...and in my mind...i was thinking...is this a joke?? really??  Btw...that ""freshly hand squeezed"" 1/4 full pineapple juice cost me almost $10...i still had a great time...just bcz of my lovely friends!!

Whether or not you decide to come here for brunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed! En is located right in the heart of the West Village, pretty close to the 1 Train. Once you get within a block, you can't miss it. Right when you step inside, you are welcomed by a nice display of sake, the bar to your right, and then the restaurant on the left-hand side. This place has great ambiance and is an amazing place to take someone for some good ol Japanese food.If you like to show up on time like me, then you're probably going to be waiting for the rest of your party at the bar. Luckily they have a stacked sake list, as well as a decent selection of beer. My drink of choice here has always been the Hitachino Nest White Ale, and that will never change.Alright, now onto the food. If you're going to order one thing here, please let it be their homemade tofu. This dish is just simply amazing. Freshly made throughout the day, you can really taste the difference in comparison to your store bought tofu. As far as entrees go, the clay rice pot with salmon roe is just a must. The portion is enough to split among three people, and with this quality, you cannot ever dislike it. The rice comes with shiso, salmon roe, salmon chunks, and some other random veggies that I can't really remember. All I know is that every time that I come to En, I have to order this dish.Now if you're the type with a sweet tooth, then oh boy does En have a treat for you. Their apple sorbet is too legit to quit. This is homemade, and literally has chunks of apple inside, which gives it just an amazing taste. It's pretty much frozen chunky apple juice, for lack of better words.On my usual visits, I tend to get the following things:- O-Banzi: Hijiki, Butabara to renko no kinpira, Zenmai piri-kara- Warm Tofu- Burikama Karaage- Clay Rice Pot with Salmon Roe- Stone Grilled Organic Chicken- Stone Grilled Washugyu- Kurabuta kakuni- Apple SorbetEn is just simply amazing. Throw away your crappy excuse for Japanese food, and stop by here for some real hearty food. From appetizers to desert, combined with an amazing ambiance and service, you really get the total package at En. As long as this place is open, I will keep on coming back to gorge on their amazing treats.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I like the grilled chicken but it's 18 dollars for a Japanese tapa. shabu shabu very good also pricey. rolls nothing special specially the spicy chu Toro. 21 dollars ! very beautiful room. the soft tofu is also great but also very expensive.  and u can have it much better in other places. not because is a good room u can charge 3 times or 4 times the price.cocktails are 14 and tinny, u need 4 to make a real drink, no joke.service is all over the place, to big of a restaurant trying way to hard and they are probably not making any money because there are so many employees. I would actually give them 2 starts but I know what's like to own a restaurant this big and it's tough.good luck to them and if u read my review u will undestand.if they make a simpler menu more isakaya style this would be amazing. for kaysake @ 100 plus per person u have to be perfect like in Kyoto.not to mention the sashimi prices, wow.I am not complaining about the prices but if u order food the way it should be ordered it would cost more then 200 per person. u can't go to a kaysake style place and not have sashimi. that's ridiculous. really if u want to be a kaysake restaurant just do that. don't try to do all.cheers",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

It's whisper quiet and serene in there; a good place to eat if you'd like to actually hear your dining companions. The service is attentive; maybe a little TOO attentive, if you know what I mean (holy shit, i JUST took my last bite and my bowl is cleared away). One of my cousins has a severe dairy and nut allergy, and they were super careful about checking with the chef.The whole idea of this is small plates, so of course everything is on the small side - i happen to think this is ideal, because I would rather try a bunch of things than just eat one giant serving of something. We started out with a couple of the O-Banzai- the daikon radish (It was good, nothing special...it is just shaved radishes in dashi) and the sauteed pork belly and lotus root - tasty, but nothing to write home about. The Chu Toro sashimi was a work of art and melted in your mouth; just perfect.  We also had a special ramp tempura, which was addictive! Perfectly crunchy.The freshly made tofu was comforting and warm on the chilly night, the wari-joyu enhanced the soybean flavor. People who think tofu is bland should try this. Subsequently we had:Saikyo Miso Black Cod - this was really well done, perfectly cooked; however, this totally got overshadowed by....Unagi no Shirayaki- this is grilled FRESH eel, flown in from Japan, and it's one of the seasonal dishes - totally tender and delicate. I thought I liked the frozen, prepackaged eel a lot but now I can't even believe they are the same species.The Mochi Croquette- my friend Sonny directed me to eat this and he wasn't wrong - it was delicious, all glutinous rice outside and rich and sticky duck inside....Note though, that the texture might be a little strange for people who dont like gelatinous things as this is SUPER gelatinous and sticky to boot. Foie Gras Chawanmushi - Rich and warm and smooth.Clay Rice pot- this was tasty, with the salmon and salmon roe, but honestly I think it was a waste of stomach space- I would have rather tried something else.For dessert we had some tea and the red bean soup, which came with some floating toasted mochi (again with the glutinous, but I loved the campfire taste of the mochi, although it was a little hard to eat)  ice cream and some delicious fried crispy yam things. We also made it in time for the Sake tasting, which is 3 generous portions of sake on ice, for $18.All in all, with generous tip, the bill was $300 - not cheap, but I thought it was totally worth it for the quality of the food that we got.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

513,KYrA99zoFNYS39bFY-t60w,Lucy C.,5.0 star rating,"I've been hearing great things about this place for a while and finally made reservation with some friends yesterday. I was blown away by the decor and great ambiance. It had a very upscale, trendy, modern Japanese feel with a lot of different seating options. There are even low tables with mats for those who want a more authentic Japanese eating experience. There are many tall windows to allow maximum light in during the day and at night the atmosphere is very romantic. Perfect place to come with a small group. They also offer coat check.When we were seated, a very friendly waiter greeted us. However, he kept trying to get us to order without giving us even a second to even look at the menu. He kept going on and on describing the dishes and seemed very nervous. I really appreciate his effort though. I started off with a freshly squeezed, pink grapefruit cocktail with gin and honey. One of my all-time favorite drinks now, sweet but not overpoweringly so--very light and fresh. I also tried the seasonal sake--best sake I've ever had. It was very smooth and clean.I ended up ordering the Soyo Kaze and my friend got the other 7 course meal. The three small appetizers that came with it were made with high quality ingredients, but it was nothing special. The sashimi was very fresh, some of the best I've had. The grilled black cod was definitely my favorite. It was marinated in saikyo miso and was extremely flavorful--amazing. EN's freshly made tofu is apparently famous, ""untouchable"", so I was most excited to try it. Absolutely delicious. It was so soft is practically melted in my spoon. The wari-joyu sauce that came with it complimented it very well. Next, I had the stone grilled organic chicken. My friend had a bite and said it was the best Asian-style grilled chicken he had ever had and I agree, it was very tender and appetizing. The last dish was the chilled soba noodles. I'm not a huge fan of soba but I truly enjoyed EN's soba. The broth was excellent. Finally, we were served strawberry ice cream, which was much better than standard ice cream, but i was disappointed we didn't have the choice between green tea and red bean ice cream like most Japanese places. I also tried my friend's black truffle egg custard, which was absolutely great and the eel rice pot, which cooked on our table for 25 minutes before we could eat it--very fun. I really appreciate little nuances like that.Overall, the food was very fresh, prepared well, and definitely healthy. The ingredients were all high quality and with none of that extra nonsense. The portions were small to medium, so don't come here if you're starving. I left relatively full. My set was $65, which is on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. My friend had a lot more food in his set, which was $90. Overall, with drinks, food, tax, and tip, it was around $250. Wait time was reasonable and bathrooms were very clean. Will have to lay low on high-class dining for a bit now but would definitely like to come back here again.

The best discoveries are always serendipitous, as they say.First, what a gorgeous, airy space. This is probably one of the few restaurants in Manhattan that can make you forget you're actually in Manhattan, the land of delicious food consumed in cramped quarters. Take a few minutes to wander around and absorb all of the design details: the recessed panels of bamboo stalks and whimsical carved wooden blocks, the latticework art, the luxuriously cut branches of cherry blossoms.We spent a few minutes waiting at the bar and snacking on vegetable chips, which we realized too late were actually ordered by the extremely polite European sitting next to us and not communal. Oops.EN's menu is technically family style with a focus on small plates meant to be shared. In our experience, however, most of the protein options are more than substantial enough to be considered entrees. The two of us left stuffed with the below spread:(1) Freshly scooped tofu, warmed. This silken heaven is made on premise three times a day. So simple, so refreshing. I recommend you enjoy on its own before adding the miso soy sauce it comes with. I've grown up eating tofu all my life but the freshness and purity of this rendition made me taste it in a whole new light. (2) Calf liver sashimi. This was my first time trying raw offal and I think I might like it better than foie gras even. Make sure you get a mouthful with the green onions, garlic dressing, and sesame oil dipping sauce all in one bite. Chew slowly and savor.(3) Buri kama kara age (fried yellowtail collar in a pepper-soy sauce vinaigrette). Fantastic texture and flavor, on the sweeter side.(4) Braised black sea bass nitsuke. We destroyed this poor fish. Ridiculously fresh with a lightly sweet sauce. The vegetables that came with--okra, carrots, lotus root, and spinach--were tender and tasty.(5) Black sesame and fig ice cream. Both excellent with morsels of real sesame and fig, though I was definitely a bigger fan of the former.My only quibble about the whole experience was our young, Ms. Frizzle-esque waitress, who was perfectly sweet if not the most attentive of creatures. We had been seated 10 minutes before she came over to introduce herself and only after we had flagged down another waiter. A more seasoned coworker would probably also have recognized that the two fish entrees we ordered shared a similar sweet sauce and brought it to our attention. I imagine the service is significantly better if you're sitting at one of the actual tables along the windows as opposed to the group dining square in the center.

THE FOODAs this was our first time dining at En and we wanted to try some of the dishes they're known for (fresh tofu, black cod, etc.), we both decided to get the Soyo Kaze prix fixe menu.  Many other Yelpers have complained about the high prices here, which is understandable if you focus on the a la carte menu, I think the fixed menus are a bargain if it works for you.  Our menu had seven courses, and the quality across the board was excellent - especially the black cod and stone grilled chicken.We also split an order of the fried chicken.  We skipped the sake pairing option and just ordered a couple of drinks, but if I were to do it again I would have gone for the sake pair - this is a long meal and I think it would have complemented the dishes nicely.THE SERVICEAs you would expect from a higher-end Japanese restaurant, the service was very friendly and efficient - our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, the pace of the dishes moved along well, and our dishes were always cleared away quickly and water topped up promptly after each course.Overall, I give En 5 stars.  For a special occasion with a group or if I am hungry for good izakaya food (and willing to spend $100+/person), this is a great choice.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

It's a lot of food in my opinion and a good price for the quality of the food - which is excellent. The non-vegan was a trio of something - it was all delicious and salty and cold - something seaweed, mushroom and something else. Then 2 pieces each sashimi - tuna, salmon, yellow tail. It was the most delicious fresh buttery fish. Excellent. Then the Black Cod? - a decent size piece in a miso broth that was so delicate and buttery and just so delicious. Then homemade tofu w a broth, the organic chicken - which I wasn't excited about a first but it came sizzling hot on a stone and was  perfect, moist, a little seared, and delicious. Lastly the soba which was just ok after all that other delicious food. Kind of bland for soba. The vegan preset is good as well. But a shame it's the same price as all that delicious delicate fish and chicken. You get to try the tofu, some yummy smoked veggie salad w soy milk dressing, a roasted eggplant dish that's impossible to eat w chopsticks lol, 7 grain rice and mushroom dish, sushi roll, veg tempura. All very good and thoughtfully done. Vegans and  vegetarians will not be disappointed. Had the non alcoholic pomegranate something drink and it was super yummy. The apple sorbet is amazing!

So we decided to do our own thang. We started off with ""appetizers"" or I guess lighter dishes:- Raw tuna with avocado salad: tuns pieces was rich and fatty. Just delicious. I loved the big avocado pieces also. It literally was just the tuna and avocado. But it was simple yet wonderful. - Dashi tofu: Was this really tofu? It taste different when it's fried and crispy! So good. The sauce? Addicting. - Assortment of sashimi (9 pieces): All so delicious!! The pieces were thick and with the right amount of soy sauce/wasabi, you were in heaven. Next, the ""heavier"" dishes:- Uni roll: I am a huge uni fan but this roll was light, very springy, and topped with delicious uni. - Karei karaage (flounder) - Bones and all! But I had no problem eating it. It was so crispy and flavorful. Loved every bite of it. I would recommend this dish! My favorite.Drinks: I didn't get any drinks since I was (and still am) on antibiotics. Sad face. But next time I will definitely try out a cocktail.Service: Initially the service was great but as the restaurant got busier, service started slacking. At least the delicious food made up for it.

They did not.  Not even slightly salted.  It was entirely bland and tasteless. I wouldn't eat it again if someone gave it to me for free.As for the appetizers, they were not memorable either.  The silken tofu that everyone raves about...yes it was soft but isn't all tofu? I don't see the big deal here. I'm glad it came with the soy sauce, which added some taste to my meal.  As for the other appetizer...I don't even remember what I ate. I think that speaks for itself.The décor is pretty and decent...but nothing outstanding.  Chairs and tables are low, which I appreciate because it felt authentically Japanese and also because I am short.  The crowd made the restaurant even less desirable.  It was packed pretentious people who I'm sure is raving about this place just because it is a trendy restaurant, but fail to care that the food has no taste.

Tip: try to sit closer to the bar itself because that's where the food is served.  The tables are communal so expect to share with people but that didn't pose any problems at all.There are no waiters to serve you; it's a buffet.So what does $45 get you?  1) Unlimited Sapporo Beer. Uh, awesome?2) Sesame toasted silk tofu:  If you are a fan of freshly made soft, silken tofu, you are in for a treat. It's so fresh, it melts in your mouth.  3) Japanese-style salad topped with seaweed:  the sauces were a mix of citrus and vinaigrette; it was good and opened up your appetite for more foods to come.3) fried eel bones with peppers:  light and crispy, wasn't oily- and the sweet peppers was a nice addition.4) tuna collar:  This was my favorite among them all.  It was meaty and smoky, the texture was unique and like Joe L. mentions, had the consistency of eating chicken.  I seriously want to eat this on their regular menu but sadly, I don't think its offered.  5) Sashimi over rice:  A-mazing.  Most likely, the end pieces of the sashimi was used but it was still equally tasty.  Topped that off with vinegar-rice? Yum.6) Fish Head Miso soup:  you will never drink regular bland miso soup ever again once you taste this.  The fish head gives the soup that extra oomph!  Think tonkatsu ramen broth (where the pork bone gives the broth an even more rich intense flavor).  Flavors were aromatic and as Asian customs dictates, I slurped my bowl really loudly (to indicate a well done soup). No shame.  7) Fried Chicken Cutlets: 'nuff said.The food keeps coming so if you miss your chance on some portions, don't worry; dishes continuously come out.  Another good thing is that since reservations are needed, there is a good crowd control so it's never really that packed and everyone gets their portions.  With all that and unlimited beer, you will be rubbing your belly all the way home for a well deserved sleep.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

The miso cod was incredible - perfectly cooked, well seasoned - I ate every bit of it.We also had a pumpkin soup that was on the specials menu - it was served cold, in a bowl over ice, which seemed like it was more for show than function, however, no complaints, it was quite tasty.One of the people I was dining with swears by the stone grilled chicken - she says it's the most incredible chicken she ever has tasted. I guess I'll have to take her word for it.My other dining companion ordered the 8 piece sushi dinner - I had a piece of the salmon. It was fresh, but nothing extraordinary I've never had before.

You get a bunch of small dishes accompanying your main dish ( a whole set). My favorite lunch item so far is either the friend chicken or the black miso cod. The restaurant has classy decor and high, lofty ceilings. Downside may be that your meal may get very pricey very fast, so I would recommend trying it for lunch first.

579,oTft3Q54PwpaRRICmTc0PA,Joe L.,5.0 star rating,"Thanks Wing L. and Vicky L. for inviting me to join the festivities at EN Japanese Brasserie known as ""makanai"". This monthly event at the restaurant is a unique dining experience that I think should be on any foodie's bucket list. Simulating what the kitchen staff eat on a regular basis, this event costs $45 and features a buffet of tofu topped with toasted sesame, lightly dressed greens, a giant platter of tuna collar, fried chicken, fried eel bones and roasted peppers, sashimi sushi rice, and fish head soup.I'm not much of a fish person usually... but the soup and the tuna collar was delicious. The fish head soup is a miso-based soup and the fish adds an element of depth to the flavor that I haven't tasted in a bowl of miso soup before. It was extremely delicate and bold at the same time. The tuna, the tuna was just awesome. Because it is on the collar, the meat isn't as flaky and soft as miso black cod, it's more of the consistency of chicken. The best thing... you can't order this item off a menu anywhere else. It's just unique.I can go on and on about the meal. But it's just making me hungry. I won't over-hype anything more, you guys need to eat it to experience it. Hopefully I've convinced you to go make reservations for the dining experience. First Thursday of every month.

Ambiance is great and the staff was fairly attentive.The RW prix fixe started out with the house-made tofu I'd heard so much about. It was subtle and delicious, served in a fish broth with a little bit of ginger on top.Appetizers were some kind of pickled (?) fern and some thinly sliced mushrooms in a light citrus-y broth. Both were very tasty, and the texture of the ferns was pleasantly unusual.For the entree, we both ordered the ""kaki fry,"" which was essentially a plate of breaded oysters that would've been at home on a po'boy. They were all right, but it didn't seem like a particularly inventive menu choice, and I was a little disappointed.Dessert was black sesame ice cream, which was actually fantastic: dense, very creamy, not too sweet, and served at the perfect texture and temperature.Got the recommended sake flight to accompany the food ($18 extra). All three were very good--their sake list exceeds most restaurants' wine lists, and they clearly know what they're doing.I left feeling relaxed but somehow not quite satisfied. Like I said, the portions are tiny considering what you're paying for them. The tofu and apps were each about the size of a small scoop of ice cream, and the dessert was...well, a small scoop of ice cream. The entree included only four oysters.

Interior is breathtaking. I love the open kitchen and centerpiece; it's really a great environment to enjoy food in. The house-made tofu was undoubtedly delicious, and so were the two Kyoto-style appetizers. One was gluten in a sweet sauce which was just ok, and another with daikon and beansprouts in a white wine yuzu sauce, which was great. Our main course, the kurobuta kakuni, or pork belly, was just meh. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it just wasn't GREAT. Too similar to Chinese food, and the pork was slightly overdone. But other than that, the vegetables were wonderfully executed. Miso soup was fantastic, and the rise was, well, your average rice. Sufficient presentation in all dishes. Hands down the best part of the meal was most likely the black sesame ice cream. It was truly something extraordinary... I'm even craving some right now. On the other hand, service was good. Nice waitress took a photo of my dad and I while others seemed friendly and offered us water very often. Food: 24 | Decor: 28 | Service: 22 THE VERDICT: Overall, I'd probably recommend EN to the 1%er. I understand this is in the city, but sometimes food prices just don't match with the food itself.

Homemade Tofu - apparently this is made fresh every hour or so and has received a fair amount of hype.  It was good, but no more stunning than the street side do hwa you can get in Chinatown for $1.  I did enjoy the plating in a wooden sake box2. O-Banzai - our two Kyoto-style Appetizers were fried eggplant in bonito broth and dried daikon.  The eggplant was actually pretty tasty although unexpectedly chilled.  The daikon was forgettable, and I didn't bother to finish it3. Grilled Lobster with Uni - as subtly alluded to above, this was a tiny lobster half...more of a hulking crawfish or tiger shrimp than a respectable lobster.  I recently read The Secret Life of Lobsters, which goes into detail on how lobsters run a fairly brutal society with dominant males beating all the lesser lobsters into submission on a nightly basis.  I would hazard a guess that the lobsters we ate were not dominant.  They should have been thrown back for a few more years under the sea down where it's wetter, take it from me.  The flesh was on the chalky side and the uni miso glaze overpowered any lobstery sweetness that might have existed.  When it comes to lobster, there are few better accompaniments than butter.  The potatoes with dots of brown sauce on top looks disturbingly like mammaries, which was probably appropriate for the baby crustaceans4. Miso Soup - the restaurant was approximately 200 degrees and they served us hot soup...amazing...many customers complained about the heat, but the temperature in the dining room never changed5. Onigiri - this flower shaped ball of rice was attractive but rather bland6. Garlic Shiso Fried Rice ($10) - infinitely better than the onigiri, this fried rice was very garlicky and topped with shiso and seaweed.  I might have hoped for some fried egg and more salt, but it was probably the best thing we ate7.

As I plopped on to a stool, I couldn't help but dive right in to the tranquil aura and modern, sophisticated space surrounding me.  Spatially, especially by NYC standards, EN is very expansive.  The restaurant is comprised of various dining areas and private nooks that are divided by paneled glass walls reaching up to the mile-high ceiling.  Larger-than-life paned windows frame the perimeter of the space.Breathing a sigh of calm, I asked one of the bar tenders to recommend a shochu-based cocktail - to which I ordered the ""Ginger"":  homemade ginger ale, rice shochu, lime juice, and soda.  A couple of delicious sips in, Michelle arrived. Once I closed my tab at the bar, the two of us formally checked in with the hostess and were promptly led to our table.Upon sitting, we were presented with cocktail, a-la-carte, and Restaurant Week dinner menus, in addition to chilled towels to wipe the ""city"" off of our hands.  How lovely and sophisticated! Our empty glasses quickly became filled with ice-cold water as our adorable Japanese waiter inquired about additional beverages.  Michelle followed my lead and ordered a ""Ginger,"" while I decided to switch things up and try the ""Seppun"":  shiso leaf, grapefruit and yuzu juices, shochu.As satisfied as I was with the ""Ginger,"" the ""Seppun"" knocked my socks off.  The contrast of the muddled shiso leaf with the two citrus fruits was pure magic.  Sweet, sour, and herbaceous notes sung the most lovely chord, leaving me wondering if the shochu had ever been added in the first place.  After one more round, however, there was no doubt that the Seppun was one highly addictive and very deceptive cocktail (I could not taste the alcohol...but after two, I certainly felt it.).  In other words, it was perfect.It didn't take Michelle and I long to know that we wanted to go the - gasp - Restaurant Week (menu) route.  Hell, it had me at lobster tempura, after all.The first course to arrive was the Handmade Tofu.  Now, had I not read so many wonderful things about this dish, there is no way in hell that I would have EVER ordered it for myself.  To me, tofu has always seemed like a tasteless, gelatinous mess that is eerily formed in to a perfectly bite-sized square.  And it's white.  And it has human facial-like pores.  And it wiggles.  No thanks. However, what was presented before Michelle and me was the farthest thing from a stark-white square.  No, this was custard-like.  Hand scooped!  In the shape of a cloud.  Surrounded by a shallow pool of ""wari joyu,"" a sweet/salty blend of soy sauce and fish broth, and topped with a light dusting of green onions.  ""Is this really tofu?""  I asked Michelle.  ""I mean, it tastes more like a savory custard.  It's actually really good!""  First Restaurant Week, now tofu?  This certainly was making for a big night. We didn't have to wait more than 5-minutes for our next course, the O-Banzai, which is the chef's selection of two Kyoto-style appetizers, to arrive.  This was my least favorite portion of the meal, as we were presented - albeit beautifully presented - with two bowls of rather bland Japanese ""mountain"" vegetables.  Although hard to distinguish, I believe that one contained mushrooms and the other, some type of green bean.  Yawn.As perfectly-paced as the prior two were, our entree course arrived within 10-minutes of our completion, if you will, of the vegetables. A bright red, halved lobster carcass was presented next to tempura-battered chunks of its own meat.  A single green pepper plus a small mountain of wasabi and yuzu salts accompanied.  As barbaric as all of that may sound, it made for quite an artful display.  All but a couple of chunks of the lobster yielded fresh-tasting meat; unfortunately, the pieces which came from the tip of the claw were very fishy and mushy. On a separate plate came flower-shaped onigiri, which was laced with sesame seeds and some sort of green.  Since we felt the need to dip, drizzle, and dunk, Michelle asked for a side of soy sauce.  In addition, a bowl of miso soup accompanied, though I couldn't tell you what it tasted like.  I hate the stuff.  The final course to arrive was a single, perfect scoop of black sesame ice cream.  Black sesame anything reminds me of Hong Kong, which conjures up very happy and delicious memories.  This particular flavor of ice cream tastes similar to peanut butter, with a texture almost like cookies n' cream, due to the sesame nibs.  Yum!",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I went with two friends (foodies and notorious over-orderers who happen to live in the neighborhood and were not aware of ENJB either). We were all pleasantly surprised when we arrived as the restaurant is really spacious, high ceilings, nicely decorated and has different areas, like a sushi bar, private rooms behind shoji screens and (liquor) bar. I was a little bit nervous because in the past when I have gone to upscale restaurants during Restaurant Week, I have been treated less than, shall we say, a preferred customer (shady!). But the staff at ENJB was lovely and the service was great from start to finish.My friends and I did order from the RW $35 menu and while my notoriously over-ordering friends were really impressed by the regular menu's offerings, they basically stuck to the plan. There was an additional RW offering of a saki flight: a wooden tray holding four different types of saki to taste, which we all got. The appetizer was a handmade tofu - extremely creamy and delicious. As an entree, I had the lobster tempura, which didn't look that thrilling, but was actually very sweet, moist and delicious, with an accent of sancho salt. My friends both ordered the steak and got the upgrade to kobe beef (for an additional cost), which they both enjoyed very much. For dessert we all got the black sesame ice cream: very nice. After dinner we asked for the drink menu and saw that they have an extensive shochu, so we couldn't resist having a cocktail too. All in all, we ended up spending about $80 a piece (so much for sticking to the $35 plan!), however, we all thought it was well worth it for the good service, nice ambiance and good food and drinks. A normal night out at this place looks like it would run a couple hundred dollars a head.

We also each got a glass of their house-infused shochu (I liked the brown sugar flavor over the ginger).I wasn't as big a fan of the three appetizers, but the tuna+avocado salad was incredibly fresh, as was the freshly-made tofu. The best dishes we had were the miso-crusted cod (melt-in-your-mouth fish goodness) and the salmon rice pot (who knew steamed salmon, salmon roe, and rice went so well together?). The organic chicken was also pretty good (where can I find wasabi salt in New York?!

The entrees here are actually tapas portions by design, even though they're in the $20-$35 range.  The waitress pointed this out when answering our questions about some of the dishes, so at least we had a chance to leave before committing to the wallet pilfering (more on this connivery later).  But the point here is that this is not stated on any of the menus, so if you don't ask, you wouldn't be in the know.  You can thank me later.We ordered several items, one of which was the 15 piece sashimi plate.  The salmon was very good, the hamachi was good, but the tuna was not fresh (ie - flavorless, rougher and much less tender than fresh tuna should be).  When we mentioned this to the waitress, she seemed in disbelief, and later returned with ""the chef said this is Big Eye Tuna, so it's supposed to taste like that.""  According to the waitress, En decided to start serving Big Eye Tuna as opposed to its normal Blue Fin Tuna because Blue Fin Tuna is on the endangered list.  I'm all for supporting animal conservation efforts, but the least you can do is give your customers prior notice before serving it or taking the order.  If you know the taste is different than what your customers are used to tasting because you purposely are changing the type of fish being served, wouldn't it be a courtesy to your customers who are shelling out buco bucks in hopes of enjoying some high quality sashimi, to tell them to expect a different taste than the tuna they normally are served at high end sushi restaurants?  Another UNpleasant surprise was a special dish that was not printed on the menu, which was a snapper dish.  This dish was verbally quoted at $17, but when the check came, we were charged $20 for it.  Yes, I know the difference was only $3, but the fish served was actually just the head (complete with eyeballs, of course) which had very little edible meat on it (as can be expected - since usually there is very little edible meat on a fish head).  Unless you grew up in a prior generation or two in mainland China (or most other eastern Asian countries), you probably aren't pleasantly surprised to be served just the head of a fish, nor skilled at eating it, for that matter.  I do want to be fair here and add that the broth it was served in was quite tasty.Now last but definitely not least was the stinker / kicker of the night.  When the bill arrived, the damage came in at $231 (for two people including drinks).  This wasn't the surprise.  We asked to have the bill split into two specific amounts on two different credit cards.  One of the bills came back to us with an extra $20 charged, for no appropriate reason.  Mathematically, it wasn't an auto gratuity.  In fact, the bottom of both bills each had the FULL suggested gratuity amounts printed, which indicated no gratuity had been automatically included in either bill.The only reason I didn't rate En with only one star is because one of the dishes, the Gindara, was very well prepared and delicious.  Other than this one bright point, the rest of the food and experience were nowhere near the caliber of dining one would expect from the caliber of prices one will be paying (or at least be charged, for that matter).  I'm giving props to Lana T.

How do I know what I'm going to want to eat days in advance?Lately I've been going out to eat super early or sitting at the bar. That's the only way you can get in to some of the hot restaurants in the city without a reservation. And both those options are fine with me. But in order for me to taste the tuna collar at the fish heads, eel bones, and beer dinner, I had to make a reservation. This feast happens on the first Thursday of every month at 9:30pm. The tuna collar isn't guaranteed to be on the menu, but usually makes an appearance.So we showed up just before 9:30pm and were directed to very uncomfortable stools at a very narrow bar. Without any instructions or introductions, food slowly started making its way to the bar. We were given glasses for unlimited Sapporo refills and like a wedding buffet, a line started forming at the food table.This dinner is called a ""makanai"" and is a meal exclusively for restaurant employees in Japan before or after their shift. They're called family meals in this country and having worked at restaurants for the last 10 years, I've experienced my fair share of these. Generally, they're made with the leftovers and are uninspired and rushed. I've heard tales of restaurants with elaborate and delicious family meals, but somehow I've never been employed by one of those places. Chef Abe Hiroki also uses the leftovers (to conserve waste) to create this feast, but the dishes he puts out are far from uninspired and rushed.The food came out in intervals and I was getting a little worried the tuna collar was not going make an appearance after all. But as I nervously surveyed the bar, I grabbed plates of bamboo shoots seasoned with bonito flakes, mixed chirashi (sashimi and rice), a crisp and bitter green salad with a great ponzu dressing, chicken katsu (fried tender cutlet), a bowl of deeply flavored miso soup with sea-bream head, and a pile of crunchy deep fried eel and fluke bones.The fried bones were the highlight of the meal for me. They had such an unusual texture with a strong crispy exterior. The flavor was a subtle blend of fish and oil, with lots of salty crunch. And once you got through the layer of panko bread, the brittle bones provided even more crunch. These were difficult to stop eating.The tuna collar took its time, but finally made it out as the grand finale of the meal. A server cut the meat off the bone and served it that way.  The meat from the collar had been marinated in sake and miso, so it had sweet and complex notes. The meat itself was fatty and richly flavored.  It was a great end to this unique and adventurous meal, although I couldn't resist one more helping of those fried bones.And throughout the meal, we were allowed unlimited Sapporo refills.

607,J91Z-EF0G8n8rSj4EJKqqw,Asuka N.,4.0 star rating,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner yesterday evening. I really dig the atmosphere, which has high ceilings and the right amount of Japanese decor. We ended up sitting in one of the private rooms in the back, which has the tatami floor and where you would usually sit cross-legged, but there's space under the table to put your legs - so it's like sitting on a bench, which is much more comfortable. The waiters were very good about bringing food in a well-timed fashion so that everyone had something to eat. If anything, they were a bit impatient with the speed at which we ate - we took forever to figure out what to eat, and we definitely held them up from closing up shop (we ended up leaving at 12:30, well after closing time.Instead of trying to pick courses on my own, I went with the 'aozora' tasting menu, which incorporates some of the seasonal items and entrees that aren't available on the a la carte menu. The worst item on the menu was the sashimi, strangely enough...I'm not sure what it was, but the tuna and salmon sashimi were incredibly second-rate and seemed like it wasn't fresh at all. I've had better sashimi at the cheap Chinese-run sushi joints...very disappointing. The fish selection is also extremely limited. The beginning appetizers also weren't amazing. The seared tuna was good, but it was overshadowed by the radish, of which there was too much. The brussel sprouts were somewhat unimaginative, and the oyster wasn't memorable.That said, the rest of the courses were very well done. The egg custard with black truffle was a highlight. Aside from being a sucker for anything with truffles in it, it really does add a nice depth of flavor to a dish that usually is pretty straightforward. The scallops with uni sauce was absolutely delicious as well - the uni works really well at adding a unique flavor. The various rice pots I had here - the snow crab, the salmon, and the anago that came with the tasting menu specifically - were all delicious. The 15-grain rice has great depth of flavor, and the broth it's cooked in really cooks into both the rice and the meat/fish. The miso glazed foie gras was different - the liver isn't as meaty as I've had at French restaurants, but it allows for the miso flavor to seep in, which was very tasty. Paired with the filet mignon, this may have been my favorite dish of the course. Dessert is also really good - the macha quartet gives you green tea everything -  pudding, cookies, chocolate, and ice cream (I think? I was a bit tipsy by this time) was well-done.Sushi aside, the dishes here are very good, while at the same time offering a fusion twist (like foie gras) on the foods of other cultures. I'd like to come back and try some of the other dishes a la carte - in the end, I don't think I'd go with the tasting menu because the sushi was a lost cause. All in all, though, it's very well done.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Finally, one of the hosts comes over to speak with us.  Oh lovely, is he coming to update us on the status of our table, or to apologize for the wait, perhaps even offer us a drink for the inconvenience?  No.  He is coming over to tell us in a very cross fashion not to stand in the busiest part of the restaurant.  I tell him, look, we moved here because someone stepped on my friend's foot, and we've been waiting for nearly half an hour.  But we shift back into the ""bar"" half of the restaurant to continue waiting in a much more crowded area.The jostling continues.  Finally I go back to the host station and say, look, we are going to go back to standing in this area, because we are being jostled, and by the way, we've been waiting for our table for half an hour, after being called (twice) to confirm our reservation, so could you please tell us what is going on.  (I do not mention, although it is quite obvious, that there have been four empty counter seats for some time now which we have not been offered, or that various small parties of handsome white folks have been seated while we have not.  It's that darned would-be nightclub thing again.)The gentleman with whom I am speaking:- Accuses me of ""screaming"" at him (when I had not in fact raised my voice at all, and the rest of our dinner party, standing right behind me, could not even hear what I was saying.)- Walks out from behind the host station into the bar area and says to us, and I quote: ""look, you can stand right here.  Why don't you stand right here.  Do you want to eat our food or not?""When I ask to speak to the manager, he replies (with a smile and a triumphant flourish) ""I am the manager.""  I request his card.  Although Mr. Adler's card does not identify his title, a Google search done later on confirms that he is the general manager.  At this point - and it is now 32 minutes past our reservation time, the very time that the restaurant called repeatedly to remind me about - we leave for Village Yukucho.  Someone else in my group tells Mr. Adler that he owes me an apology.  He does manage to mouth, very insincerely, the words, ""I am truly sorry,"" but it is quite obvious that he is pleased and relieved to see his customers leave.   Again, tragic.   I imagine Mr. Adler feels that he can do whatever he likes, given that he is the manager and therefore there is no one to whom his behavior can be reported.  Even if your restaurant is busy, you cannot treat your customers with contempt.  I suppose that a letter to the owner, who may or may not realize how badly her management is defeating the efforts of those doing the real work of feeding and serving people -- and a public warning to fellow Yelpers -- is all that remains.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

617,7mNC2WPgF8j81InrOr302g,Anie C.,4.0 star rating,"EN Japanese Brasserie is not an authentic Japanese restaurant. What you can expect to find here is a cuisine that bridges the culinary arts of Japanese dishes, along with other oriental cultural flavors, and a bit of contemporary American. This is immediately observed when you walk into the restaurant, and you find yourself in a dim-lit, lounge-y atmosphere.We started out with the fresh scooped tofu, both the hot and cold versions, which are supposedly made hourly. We were excited for this tofu, maybe a little too excited, which was why when we tried it, it just seemed a bit bland. The cold one was tougher, with a harsher texture, but a bit more refreshing. The hot one was incredibly smooth, however, and was accompanied with a delicious soy milk base.Wanting a mushroom dish, we ordered the Kinoko Kiriboshi Daikon Ohitashi, a small Kyoto-style dish, which contained ""assorted Japanese mushrooms and sun-dried daikon radish with yuzu."" The sweet sauce in this salad was absolutely delicious, and blended magnificently with the mushrooms. Definitely a hit.Continuing with the mushroom obsession, we went on to try the Kinoko Tonyu Nabe, which was a soy milk hot pot with assorted mushrooms. In concept, this dish could have been great, soy milk and mushrooms can work very well together. Unfortunately, EN did not appear to do much with the ingredients of this dish beyond throwing mushrooms into soy milk -- all of it was bland and tasteless, even the soy milk.Of course, we had to sample their rolls. We went with the Uni, Snow Crab Tempura & Avocado, and an Eel related (our bad, we forgot the exact name) roll. The Uni and Eel seemed relatively fresh, which was great, but the problem here had to do with the fact that there was simply too much rice. It was loaded with rice to the point that each sushi piece was no longer round, but squared. That's when you know you've got a sushi-problem.As for their rice bowls, the Uni Don rice was unique -- probably the most exotic dish we had that night. The Uni was freshly prepared, and its flavors mixed well with salmon roe, mountain yam, and sticky rice. A lot of strong fish flavors were present, which can easily be overwhelming, but they all worked together in the end to create an incredible, fresh fish taste.The steamed fish reminded us of a traditional Chinese dish (usually consists of steaming a live swimming fish with flavorful sauces), which surprised us again given that we were supposed to be in a Japanese restaurant. This fish, unfortunately, however, was harsh in texture, despite the attempted flavorful soy sauce that was poured on top.For dessert, we tried the soba tea pudding, the mochi donuts, and the homemade ice cream (green tea, vanilla, fig, taro, sesame, and apple sorbet flavors). We definitely give EN credit for having such a diverse and original dessert menu. It is for that reason we ended up ordering such a large variety of selections.The soba tea pudding was too sweet. You know us, we love sweets, but even this was too much for us. Just a couple bites in, we knew there was no way we would be able to finish this.The mochi donuts was a first for us -- a great, unique concept in diversifying the mochi family. Its texture was chewy, like normal mochi (maybe a bit too chewy with its hard exterior) -- regardless, our favorite part it was that unlike American donuts, this donut was mildly sweet.The ice creams were rather traditional, not too different from the ice cream we find at the supermarkets and many other Japanese restaurants. Green tea was our favorite (staying traditional here). Vanilla was bland (too similar to other vanilla ice creams in the world). Fig was different (maybe too obscure). Sesame and taro were flavorful, and probably high on our list. Apple sorbet was, unfortunately, a mess -- too sweet, with too icy of a texture.

626,EG8GA22ChU7VhPDBvngSxA,Nicole S.,4.0 star rating,"Note: This review is based solely on the Fish heads, Eel bones & Beer dinner party. Go to the restaurants website for the description. Reservation is required and they inform you that it is 'not fancy' - in the bar area (not dining room) and you serve yourself buffet style. Seating at the dinner party is on a first come first serve basis at high bar tables. I would recommend coming early if you want to snag a spot close to the bar area where the food will be served. The staff is extremely attentive and works very hard to make this a pleasant experience for everyone. I noticed a couple arrived who had an additional 6 guests who were arriving shortly. There was no space to accommodate that size together in the bar area so the host gave them a table in the main dining room. The food comes out throughout the evening. Just as another review of the dinner party noted a line forms immediately as people are anxious to eat and they are concerned there won't be enough food. If you can stand to wait (probably 45min) go up after the majority of the guests have served themselves. By that time more of the food that has already been served will be on its way out and will be piping hot. Everything was well prepared and delicious. The only thing that would have made the night even better, was an explanation of how the food was prepared in the style described on the website. My boyfriend spoke to a waiter and he described exactly which scraps were used for the nights dinner and why. The only thing that detracted from the overall experience was the other guests. Most of them spent way more time then was necessary choosing what pieces of meat they wanted. This held up the line unnecessarily as bowls and bowls of food were going to be on their way out. I would suggest the restaurant have someone stand behind the bar and ladle the food onto peoples plates. Just one other thought. The bartenders work extremely hard throughout the night - filling your glass, bringing out food and cleaning the buffet area.

I got the salmon and BF paid $13 extra for the Black Angus steak.  The salmon had a nice portion size, but it lacks excitement in the ""savory dashi broth"" sauce.  Have you had Chinese restaurant udon soup broth?  It has that oddly sweet and salty flavor that tastes quite artificial compare to the soup base from actual Japanese-owned ramen places.  Yeah, the sauce for my salmon was like a thick condensed version of that.  My BF's steak was a joke.  Again, it had a generous sized portion, but it was cooked so dry and served borderline cold that my BF actually started to steal my salmon.  The funny thing was that when he ordered the steak, the waitress didn't ask him how he liked it cooked (rare, medium, well-done, etc.).  We also had the miso soup, which tasted just like every other miso soup out there.  Thankfully, our night was saved by the Black Miso Cod, which we decided to order outside of the restaurant week menu.  We've tried Black Miso Cod in several high-end Japanese restaurants in the city, and it was the best we've ever had.  The highlight was the cod skin, which had an amazing smoky taste without any hint of fishiness.  Back to the restaurant week menu, which ended by a raspberry sorbet.  It was refreshing, but nothing special.Conclusion?  Save yourself $38 and get the Black Miso Cod for $26 (the portion size is about the palm of an adult male's hand, sliced in two pieces).",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Good service and decor): From the selected sashimi pieces in the Restaurant Week menu, we could tell that freshness and quality of fish used is top of the line. Melt in your mouth salmon and soft yellow tail opens up the appetite like no other. If you like fresh tofu, EN services the most fresh tofu we've ever had in the States. Two distinct dishes make our must indulge list: Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod (on Soyo Kaze menu and a la carte); Lobster + grilled Uni/Sea Urchin (Restaurant Week menu). The Cod was perfected marinated and very soft, while the Uni gives the Lobster an absolutely unique flavor. Stone Grilled Organic Chicken, while deliciously tender, deserves only an honorable mention because of it's lack of unique flavor.  Cons (select small dishes phone it in a bit, Price is high): Select O-Banzai dishes, while good, can be found in lower east side of Manhattan for 1/3 of the price, so they may not be the most worthwhile pickings.  The price of the meal is relatively steep, and the restaurant menu should be considered a tasting for its size and price. Comparable to: Kushi Izakaya, Sushi Taro.

Remember those restaurants that are purely 'weekday' restaurants (because you actually have things to do and you cannot afford to wait 2-3 hours for a table)? Well, that will quickly become a thing of a past since En offers open table and there is always surprisingly availability even on Friday and Saturday nights. Why? I have no idea. This remains to be understood. Located in the beautiful West Village in a rather official looking building, lies a trendy interior with high ceilings, comfortable well spaced tables, private rooms if you so choose, and an interesting centerpiece that looks like a very large tree (?). Everything about this places screams sellout, from the beautiful blonde hostess to the bound menus that looked like they came out of an old Kyoto house's attic. You would think this restaurant is entirely about the decor and ambiance, like so many other restaurants in the city. Imagine how pleasantly surprised we were to find the food here closest to what we have had in Japan. Indeed, imagine my delight after so many attempted other dining experiences have failed. I miss our kaiseki dinners in our ryokans, and En attempts to fill this carved out hole I have. From the small, well marinated 'Kyoto' dishes (my favorite was the mushrooms and royal fern sprouts), to the perfectly cooked and seasoned cod. The cod -literally- melts in your mouth, much like the effect that Ryan Gosling has on women, it's natural and immediate. The home made tofu is soft and silky, and the small wooden spoon you are given to eat it with only adds to the experience of feeling you are kneeling down in a kimono eating a kaiseki dinner. The stone grilled chicken is tender and juicy. The list goes on. I have not tried the sushi/sashimi because I feel that the most fresh sushi is from restaurants who only do sushi. Judging from the previous reviews, this is not their strong suit.My only regret is not trying the prix fixe, it's on my to do list.

The stone grilled organic chicken is another dish that I regularly order. I like to dip it in garlic shoyu and then lightly in the wasabi salt. Yum. I prefer this dish for the crispy fried chicken.

Service can be a little slow, but we weren't without food for long. I do have to commend the restaurant on a great front of the house experience. Not only did they offer to hang my coat when I got in, the host made sure to hold my place in my book while I took the coat off.Freshly-made scooped tofu: Since this is ENJB's signature dish, we had to order it and this is simply the best tofu I've ever had. It's light, flavorful and so silky smooth and the wari-joyu adds a nice light flavor - I bet more people would eat tofu if it tasted like this. The tofu is quite deceptively filling, so I was glad to have someone to share it with.Mochi croquette: This dish surprised me with how delicious it was. I wasn't quite sure the mochi would work well with the rest of the dish, but it added a nice texture and helped pull all of the flavors together. Kurobata kakuni: It's really hard to screw pork belly up, and ENJB's definitely didn't disappoint. The only thing that I didn't like about this dish is that it wasn't particularly easy to eat a little of each element together because of the big chunks of everything used in the dish.Uni don: Given that I love sea urchin and salmon eggs, it's no surprise that I loved the uni don. Uni can be very hit or miss, but the quality here was quite good (and not slimy)! Considering the ingredients, you know this will never be a cheap dish - I like to think we got this one free with the Groupon.Unagi no shirayaki: This is quite possibly the best eel I've ever had. You can taste how amazingly fresh it is (supposedly flown in from Japan) and the grilling gives it a nice char, just a touch of crispness in the skin and a nice slightly salty flavor. I'd happily eat another couple of portions of this one.Ika tosa age: The fry on this calamari is so light (I think they use panko for the breading) and it's not uber greasy like fried calamari normally is. I know bonito doesn't have a ton of taste, but it seemed to add a little bit of extra flavor and texture to the dish that I liked.Ebi shinjo: My only complaint with this dish was that it only came with three fritters! There was a good shrimpy flavor and just a taste of saltiness. I would definitely order this again.Sauteed Hudson Valley duck breast: When the dish comes, you can't see the duck at all as it's hidden underneath a pile of daikon. The daikon is really good daikon, it's both sweet and a little sour. I'm not usually a huge fan, but I ate lots of the daikon in this dish. Duck breast was so perfectly cooked and tender and the daikon elevated the flavor.Local blue crab miso soup: The actual miso soup is your standard miso soup and the crab adds a little touch of flavor. I think that there is literally an entire crab in the soup (shell, legs and all) which makes for a beautiful presentation. However, getting the meat out of the crab pieces is a little difficult and a lot of work, so I might just opt for regular miso soup next time.Oba sorbet: The sourness of the grapefruit and the tartness of the shiso lemon sorbet really balanced each other out, creating a very lovely dish. This was a nice, light way to end a meal",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

I have only been at EJB twice, and the last time, the service was a mess. First, they brought out the wrong order (we didn't say anything but definitely noticed). Then they brought the next thing, but it was really late. There was a gap of about 20, if not 30 minutes between orders, which is not okay for a small plates place. Once plate #2 arrived, we ate it, they took it away, and they brought the same order (mistakenly) again! The same was happening at the table next to us. They cannot keep track of their orders, and there is some serious miscommunication between the kitchen and the waitstaff.The food itself is okay. Sashimi is disappointing and unimaginative.

We went with the himawari kaiseki and got the sake/shochu accompaniment, and every dish was well executed and utterly delicious. I've never had freshly made tofu, and I somehow feel like I missed out for so long. The black cod was perfectly cooked. The pork belly dish was reminiscent of Japanese hotpot dishes, and was just as great as any of them. Sashimi is an integral component of traditional kaiseki so I understand why it was included, but I thought everything else was better. Not that the fish was bad (it was really delicious, actually) but I liked everything else more. Oh, and the pumpkin ice cream was, far and away, the best ice cream I've ever eaten.I'm not a shochu drinker, so the drink matching was interesting for me. In general I think it was pretty good, though the shochu was a bit much. The ice cream came with brown sugar sake, which sounded better than it was. Maybe I ate it wrong, I don't know.Now, a word of warning: if you, like the people who sat next to me, want to go to EN for sushi, just.. don't. This isn't that sort of place; it's about actual dishes. Know that in advance so you don't wind up disappointed.Anyway, all around excellent. So worth the time to go.

Also an excellent selection of japanese single malt whiskeys (if you have not ventured into this territory yet, what are you waiting for?). Our sushi rolls were amazing: a spicy, crunchy toro roll and a tempura snow crab roll with spicy mango sauce were awesome. Service was impeccable and very informative. Though we weren't prepared to swing it budget-wise, they had an 8oz Wagyu filet mignon available as a special that night...oh, if only...I was not, however, a fan of the blue shrimp nagiri. That is not their fault, I just wanted to try something new. They asked us to save the shrimp heads and they would deep fry them and bring them back to the table and we should eat them ""like you would a potato chip"". Though this was a lovely touch from a service standpoint, the fried heads themselves tasted only of oil and were simply not enjoyable.I will definitely give this place another visit and will most likely stick to sushi rolls and main courses.

Hers was cooked tableside on a portable gas grill. Mine was also cooked tableside but on a hot stone.The hot stone they bring out doesn't look hot or capable of cooking anything. However the waiter will instruct you on how to grease the stone using the piece of animal fat provided and then place the strips of kobe beef quickly on the stone to cook it.Besides the food being amazing here it's the service that really tops it off.This place is fine dining but is no way snobby.

And what's more, the place had emptied out by 10...all that wouldn't have been so bad if the food itself was better.We ordered a tuna avocado salad, probably one of the better things we had.  The Angus steak salad was not good - the meat itself was fatty and barely seasoned.  Fried tofu was actually not bad, and the broth was quite tasty.  Veggie tempura was strictly ok.  Soba noodles tasted like something you could get at a deli.  Black cod miso was blah...had much better at other places.  Sushi rolls were not bad, but again,  nothing spectacular.  Dessert was actually decent for a Japanese place.Overall, will not be going back.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Most restaurants are in small locations, which gives them a cozy, hustle-bustle feel. EN Japanese is quite spacious compared to what I expected but this fact works against them. The interior could be designed a bit differently, utilizing the space better. When you enter, the bar area to the right is quaint and setup nicely; not distracting with just enough table space for people waiting and a nice selection of sake. However, the dining area in the front of the place feels a little crowded because of the proximity of adjacent tables. Nevertheless, its the food that makes up for it.The edamame is a bit different than what I usually eat. There is a hint of miso or something similar which makes it addictive. The edatsuki edamame seems a popular choice since they were out of it by 9pm. We then moved onto the Sea Bass Kara-age which was out of this world. It was perfectly cooked with a nice light layer of fat at the edge. The fish melts in your mouth so it was a mangasm.Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the roll. We got the snow crab tempura roll which looked good but tasted a little off. The sauce was a wasabi infused miso sauce I believe (not sure) but it was a little overpowering. Use with caution...its got a delayed kick on your palette.  The roll itself would have been nice save for one ingredient. I know its name in korean (ggehn-neep) but I dunno the english translation. It wasn't right for the dish but if that wasn't there, the roll would be great.The highlight was the Gyu-suki, a ribeye cooked tableside with just the right sauce and condiments. The meat is set to medium rare but the waiter can stay to cook to your preferences.  Quite excellent. The meat is flavorful, easy to chew (even with it rare), and the condiments compliment it well. The egg they give as a dipping sauce goes great with it.The staff is courteous, professional, and very helpful. Nothing less than what's expected for dropping 100+ for a meal.  It is well worth it.The drink selection is nice, lots of choices but we stuck with the plum and peach cocktails. Not too heavy, just right for sipping and good conversation. Definite points for that.Overall, I would highly recommend this place for some fine dining japanese.

The fried rice was just a pleasant dish that had no frills, just chopped garlic and seaweed shreds on top.  A minimalist's fried rice. My favorite dish however was the salmon aburi sushi which was served nigiri style.  It was extremely tender and once it was in my mouth I wished there was more than one piece for $7.  A nice place to go for a date or if you have the money to splurge.  Overall, it's a really well-done and done-up izakaya.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

We decided to be adventurous and try lots of things and share them. For appetizers ....People had been raving about the tofu and we had to order that one. It was nice, just make sure you use a lot of the soy sauce they give you. Very smooth, very soft, nothing like the tofu you have regularly. We ordered the o-banzai. That was a really good choice. We chose the royal fern (his favorite), the lotus root w/ pork belly (surprisingly my favorite, I usually stay away from pork belly) and the creamy mushrooms (didn't like that one). It was nice getting a bunch of different things (Try the lotus!). We then had the 9-piece sashimi. It was ridiculously amazing. The yellowtail was our favorite, it was so soft, rich, and amazingly fresh. We also got the crab soup which was pretty nice, wished there were some more veggies or even noodles in it. We had the ""wood dragon,"" an oolong tea for drinks. It was so nice. Beautifully steeped and served in a very pretty pot.For entress (if you can even call them that since they were so small)We had the spicy chu toro roll (fatty tuna w/ okra). Wow, this one was a great one too. Loved the okra, I thought it'd taste weird but it gave the roll this luxurious texture. It was amazing, I kind of wished they hadn't used a spicy mayo for the spice, maybe something else different? Second, we had the kuroge washugyu hobayaki (black angus strip loin) with these little rice cakes. To be honest, the beef was amazing (rich, soft, velvety) but I felt as though those rice cakes ruined it for me. They were really hard and flavorless. I've made rice cakes before and they should have some flavor in them, they taste terrible without any seasoning. The sauce given just wasn't enough. Lastly, we ended it with the grilled fresh eel from Japan. Big mistake. Sure it's from Japan, but it's still grilled eel. It was nice, but I wouldn't recommend buying this, a bit of a waste.The menu was so creative that I really wanted to try more things, like their mochi croquette, their rice clay pots, their salads, their fried rice and fried chicken (which other people were raving out) and a bunch of other things.

It really set the stage for a great dinner.For dinner I started with the Restaurant Week Sake Flight.  Very flavorful sake and not too harsh.  It was a much different experience from other Sake I've had.  And was more about the flavor than the actual spirit.The meal started with fresh hand scooped Tofu with a sesame oil sauce with scallions on top.  This was a nice soft & creamy tofu.  Excellent starter.The Second Course was asparagus with sesame seeds and Miso (I think).  This was super fresh and had an awesome asparagus flavor.  The woody sesame seeds was a nice balance to the grassy asparagus.  It was also paired with a sort of pickled radish and fried tofu skin.  This was ok but it was a nice counter to the Asparagus.For the Main course, I had the Miso marinaded black cod.  This was awesome.  The fish was very moist and had a great flavor.  The true sign of this was how easy it was to eat with chop sticks.  I'm salivating just thinking about it...  And with the main course came a pretty standard Miso soup.  It was very refreshing and pretty good!For a dessert,  we had a black sesame ice cream...  It was amazing because it was more of a savoury ice cream than a sweet.  The sesame flavor was a little overpowering but overall it was quite good.Pricing during restaurant week was very good.  $35 for the full meal and $16 for the Sake flight.  I highly recommend EN, you won't be dissapointed.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

We ordered edamame, veggie tempura, house salad and a fried rice. We each had two glasses of wine. When we handed the waitress the menus after ordering, she handed it back to us and with a huge attitude informed us that they recommend 6-7 dishes and we hadn't ordered enough food. I expressed that it was 6pm (an early din time for me) and we weren't starving so we would order more if we were still hungry. Snappy lady walked away. Everything was FINE, and by FINE I mean I could definitely live without it and never go back. The portions were NOT small like the woman had told us. I just felt like we were treated like crap and I was over it very quickly.The bill was 100 bucks (including tip). I mean, for what we ate/drank it was a bit excessive.

687,EO8sE2OVSMuFGf5v_zIxtg,Bryan T.,5.0 star rating,"restaurantbrat.comI izakrazy for izakaya.I feel an odd attachment to EN, not because it is serves the best Japanese food out there (it doesn't) or because it tends to attract a stylish crowd (it does) or because I love the layout of the place, which features soaring warehouse ceilings with a bustling open kitchen flanking a mammoth central display that, depending on the season, could be home to an entire cherry blossom tree or a sleek granite waterfall. No, my love of this place stems from the fact that it was one of the first places to introduce me to izakaya-style dining, and my 5-star rating is in part to thank the place for this act of life-changing significance.For the quality of food alone, EN probably doesn't deserve a 5-star rating in the same way that a French Laundry or a Sushi of Gari does. However, the one thing that I've come to love about EN is it's rock-solid consistency, spanning multiple visits: dinner dates, group outings, casual drinks, and even a family reunion. There are a handful of spectacular dishes, and number of very good ones. And the rest are comfortably above average. This is what, in my mind, separates EN from the chasing pack - sheer dependability. I can't think of a single bad thing on the menu. Here are some of my favorites:Seabass Kara-age: Every single chipper on the planet needs to sample this delight and take note. The thinnest layer of crispy breading, coating the flakiest fish imaginable. With a squeeze of lemon, this is one of the best versions of fried fish I've had anywhere. Come to think of it, this may be one of my favorite dishes in NYC, full stop.    Freshly Made Scooped Tofu: Made in-house at specific time intervals through the evening. Request yours immediately as its prepared so you hit the apex of its purity and fluffiness. So fresh you can taste the soy beans that went into it. I like mine warm. Reminds me too much of stale jello cold.Stone Grilled Organic Chicken: Light and crispy, salty and tender. The accompanying garlic soy dipping sauce is divine.EN Garlic Shiso Fried Rice: One of the most overlooked items on the menu, but the cornerstone of every good meal I've had there. Considering I love garlic so much I would have it in my morning coffee, this probably shouldn't come as a surprise.Chilled Soba Noodles (with warm duck broth): Buckwheat noodles with just the right texture - springy on the first bite, then starchy and soft on the follow-through. Served on a bed of ice, to be dipped in a dark, heady broth that brings to mind a clean yet concentrated consomme.Washugyu Yaki Shabu: It's playtime! Thin slices of beef short rib that you (with childish abandon) sizzle on a hot rock. Damn it, if you can't play with your food, what's the point? The beef is well marbled and tasty to begin with, the sear brings out a smoky complexity.Kobe Sushi: When you have meat as premium as Kobe beef, why put it through the usual kitchen motions? Eat it as is, raw, unadorned beauty, on a ball of perfectly vinegared rice. There is a reason this is the finest beef on the planet. Other great dishes include the Age Dashi Tofu, Blue Crab Miso Soup, Saikyo Miso Black Cod, Kakuni (braised pork belly) and their sampler of three different types of miso paste.

Let me clarify..Taste + Fullness + Price = xmore on that later.When my girlfriend bought the groupon for this restaurant, my wallet was a bit apprehensive about going as it knew the place was a bit pricey (for my standards), but when I sat down and read that their ""style"" was small portions, my stomach became apprehensive.We started with the sake tasting menu with the sea salt chips.  You know how single people go through their lives thinking, ""maybe I just haven't met the right person?"".  Well, I was never much of a sake person but I think I just met the right sake, all 3 of them, because I loved 'em all.Then we had the pork belly(?), the stone grilled organic chicken and the garlic rice.  They were all thumbs up excellent.  And when you combine those thumbs with my girlfriend's, that was about the size of the portions too.In this case, I thought that the taste of the food held up well with the price, and I did not feel like I was ripped off in that department (the groupon helped). The food was really good and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Unfortunately, I left hungry so all the factors of the equation were there except for the fullness.  The price did not hold up well to the fullness and the taste, so I don't see myself coming back again.  I know what you're thinking...

Overall: 4.25 / 5 Food / Drink: 3.5 Due to a limited menu to do my own diet restrictions (I'm a vegetarian,) I'm only able to review the Prix Fixe Options that were available to me during Restaurant Week. As an appetizer I was able to sample their famous Handmade Tofu. It was soft, creamy, and quite delicious. The other dish that was served as an appetizer was ""O-Banzai."" As per the menu, it is described as, ""chef 's selection of two Kyoto-style appetizer."" They were both cold dishes, and while I don't recall the exact names of each selection,  they complimented the tofu quite well. I was a little disappointed with their vegetarian option in terms of the entree. Their, ""MushI fuyu yasaI or steamed seasonal vegetables with a hacho miso dipping sauce"" was a little bland. While I'm sure the vegetables were all fresh, and were steamed well, I thought I would be presented with a bit more variety and flavor. The dipping sauce however was very good. I wish I could comment more on the sake flight. I admit that I'm not as familiar with sake as I would like to be, though every sake that was presented to me was very smooth and enjoyable.

We were so frustrated that I ended up going up to the front desk to ask for the check, and even still, it took them fifteen minutes to get it to us.I strongly advise against going to EN.

Half of the table got the Aozora tasting menu while the other half had the Soyo Kaze. Almost everything from appetizer to dessert was delicious and on-point. The only thing that was kinda sub-par (partially because our expectations have already been raised from the previous courses) was the Washugyu beef dish. It was OK, just not mind-blowing.

713,6KGdXaZRaym0sH4ZeDasRA,Lowie T.,5.0 star rating,"Wow, this place is one of the most  largest, elegant, epic looking Japanese restaurant  I have seen here, aside from Morimoto but that's Japanese fusion so idk if that counts. Anyway, the place looks like an old warehouse building possibly. The ceilings are about 20 feet high, with a large tree installation growing from the center where a community seating area surrounds it. The rest of the restaurant is surrounded by dark cherry wood, grand columns, and a gigantic sushi bar where I saw a chef filleting what looked like a 7 foot fish. The bar area in the front is very classy looking and there are private rooms in the back for more traditional Japanese dining. This is definitely a place you want to take someone for a wow factor.The food does not disappoint either! I didn't know, but they were offering Restaurant Week options which were pretty generous. Although the food was so well made that I doubt anyone would get full from those portions. They did offer 2 appetizers, (the hand made tofu was silky smooth), 1 entree (delicious real lobster tempura with the whole lobster shell as garnish!) and a choice of wagyu beef for $13 extra, or a veggie dish, and dessert was a black sesame ice cream- also amazing. I opted out of the RW menu and got a miso black cod as my entree and it was probably the BEST miso black cod I ever had! The skin was crunchy and the fish was super buttery & had teh perfect amount of flavor. A small side of shredded radishes was a perfect addition to cut the buttery-ness of the cod. My friends got 2 entrees to supplement their RW meals, but I doubt they were full. For dessert the waiter recommended the ice cream sandwich which I highly recommend as well. It's 2 thin wafers with red bean, green tea ice cream, and fruit. You press down to make it a sandwich and each bit gives you a little of each ingredient, into a perfect bite. No mess, and it won't be like anything you have tried. For the grandness & great quality of food, the prices are not that bad (miso black cod was $26).

I suppose it was my mistake to think of you so highly before actually sampling your food and drinks. Perhaps that's why I feel so let down. I was expecting great things. Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good. But it was nothing more than your basic ""fancy"" Asian fusion, beautiful presentations of colorful plates full of raw fish and spices you don't normally cook with. I might be too jaded by the ""trendy"" Japanese cuisine that seems to be popping up everywhere. But don't charge me $65 for the tasting menu that doesn't wow me. I've been to this rodeo. It was a nice looking space, large scale installation artwork hanging from the ceiling and funky glassware. The design didn't wow me either, and I have been known to bump a review up a star for an awesome atmosphere. Regrettably, I can't give them props for an amazing layout. The food was, like I said, good. But not amazing. Not even awesome. There was not one dish that I can remember. Absolutely nothing stood out to me. I like to leave a meal wanting to come back for more, to try something else, none of that happened at the end of my time here. The other disappointing feature was how extremely small each portion was. My entire table left hungry (some of my party got the tasting menu, some got entrees and appetizers). The only part of the whole meal that was interesting enough to mention was the Kobe beef that was served raw and you cooked to your liking on a hot lava stone in front of you. Interesting concept, but it's not an original one. My table of 6 wound up ordering extra entrees to try and satiate our hunger, it didn't help. Here is why I went with 3 stars instead of 2. They made a killer cocktail. It's the Ginger and it's delicious. They make their own ginger ale, and its just fabulous. If I could buy it bottled, I would. Alright, so maybe it's a good cocktail spot for someone who lives nearby.

The Black Cod was delicious, and the fried chicken melted in our mouths. They accommodated our party of 18 at the beautiful upstairs space (the fee for the space was $250). They also worked with us to get the menu to the price point we were comfortable with. Cons: There was a lack of cohesion when it came to service. Food was brought in spurts. We had settled on a minimal menu (entré of chicken and black cod). They brought out the chicken first (after edamame & salad, which were also brought at different times, and far apart) then brought the cod much later. This was a bit of a problem since some of the people at the table couldn't eat meat and were waiting for the fish as their main entré. The killer was that they brought the rice, a traditional side dish last, after some of the guests were ready to leave. Also when settling on the menu we were told we would have ice cream for dessert. I should have clarified, but didn't, but everyone was served green tea ice cream. I really would have preferred a choice or a heads up that it was going to be specifically one kind of flavor.

They didn't have a table available for us right away, so we were seated at the bar to enjoy a pre-dinner drink. After glancing at the menu, we found that this place has an extensive shochu list (a huge plus!), and the night just got better from there. We only had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table. The place was busy but not overcrowded. Once we sat down for dinner, we ordered many different dishes to sample the menu - seafood, meats, etc. Everything we had was exceptional, the dishes were creative yet the flavors were still authentically Japanese. For dessert, we ordered the soba tea pudding and mochi doughnuts. It was absolute heaven. The space is huge and features modern decor, with beautiful wood detailing throughout. Somehow the place manages to accomplish a trendy, yet intimate vibe. The servers were very attentive, and were quick to offer recommendations on which sake or shochu would be best to pair with your food. If you're unsure, definitely take their advice - they know what they are talking about!

We had 9:45 reservations and were seated at 10pm, so not a huge wait on a Friday night.I really enjoyed EN's interior. A fun blend of old school touches (chefs out in the open, the big sculpture in the middle of the restaurant) and sleek modern decor. There also appear to be back rooms for groups, where patrons pulled their shoes off and dined in a more traditional manner.I wasn't up for alcohol, but they had a nice selection of non-alcoholic cocktails, like the Lychee Cooler. Homemade tofu, as everyone has said, is amazing. So creamy and light. The seaweed and soy bean appetizer was also delicious.Then came the night's one blip. Ten minutes passed. Twenty minutes passed. Our black cod entrees were nowhere to be found. People who were seated after us received their main dishes. We were left to wait.Eventually, we were approached by a woman from the kitchen. She asked if we had received our entrees. We said no. She went on to apologize profusely and say a mistake had been made, but it would be corrected as soon as possible. Our waiter soon followed and offered my mom her next glass of wine on the house.We eventually received our meal. It was worth the way. The cod was so tasty, so soft, so very yum. The rice and the miso soup were a nice, light accompaniment.We were out of Pellegrino. Without asking for another, our waiter provided a fresh bottle - this, too, was on the house, he said.Dessert was fig ice cream. The perfect serving size, delicately sweet. I think dreams are probably made of fig ice cream. Delicious.Our bill came. Our first bottle of Pellegrino was comped as well.We were Restaurant Week goers. Sure, we ordered extra drinks, but many restaurants wouldn't even blink over a blip to customers who weren't paying as much. But EN went above and beyond to overcome an honest mistake.

What you'll find here is a great dining experience with some of the most delicious flavor combinations that's hard to find elsewhere.  Even traditional dishes were prepared to perfection.

I had the EN Dinner special (for two), a ten course dinner that sampled all their 'signature' dishes... think tasting menu.  Portions were small; enough to truly appreciate the flavors of each, dare I say, creation.  It had me wondering if I stepped into an episode of Iron Chef.  By the time my black sesame ice cream came around, I was satisified, not stuffed... going to a restaurant like this, it's about an adventure in taste (not gastric expansion).

My favorite dishes include the super-fresh sashimi, fresh tofu, amazing deep-fried seabass (like butter!), and miso-glazed black cod.  Just keep in mind that good food doesn't come cheap.. this ain't no Teriyaki Boy!

Had a dinner reservation for 9 pm and it wasn't too crowded so we had our choice to sit around the huge open space surrounding the monstrous centerpiece.  FOOD/DRINK:The menu was homemade tofu, hijiki seaweed and pickled vegetable, black miso cod, miso, rice, and tangerine ice cream.  What was remarkable about the cod was the fact that I could actually taste the flavor of the fish.  Usually I feel like fish takes on the flavor of a sauce or marinade, however, the cod tasted like the ocean and was the most buttery fish I've ever had.  A lovely pickled piece of a ginger-like thing was laid on top and the entire presentation was quite thoughtful.  As mentioned by others, the house made tofu was really clean tasting; there wasn't as much of a fermented flavor as store-bought tofu.  Further, the sake flight was so lovely.  I'm not an expert by any means but the 3 sakes offered came with descriptions and had distinct flavors.  It was a fantastic pairing to the meal.  SERVICE:The service was incredible - attentive without being intrusive, friendly and the staff had absolutely 0 attitude.  FUTURE OPTIONS:  The best part is, after the wonderful meal, 2 coupons for $ off the next tasting menu were given to us.  But what I'll return for is the staff menu that's served on the 1st Sat of every month.  For $45, you can eat a menu inspired by what the cooks and chefs that work there eat with ALL YOU CAN DRINK SAPPORO.  AMAZING.I'm excited to review EN because I never thought I would have an opportunity to eat here and upon doing so, I wasn't disappointed but wowed.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

We came early so missed the explosive greeting that seems to meet each guest at this delightful Japanese restaurant. From what I can tell, the menu has adapted a bit from tofu heavy to incorporating more meats, but it is still a delightful place to take vegan and vegetarian friends. Definitely try one of the drinks with shochu (famed for not producing hangovers). We tried a ginger-shochu-lime-soda concoction which started off a bit strange and evolved with food and time into something I want to learn to make at home! The freshly squeezed pineapple juice with ginger and vodka was also a delight. A trio of appetizers is a great way to start. The okara is flavorful and a great way to dispose of tofu lees, crunchy seaweed, and asparagus with a tofu/sesame/miso sauce were all delightful. For us vegs, we tried the tempura vegetables (very light and fluffy), dumplings in a mushroom based broth, and the tofu avocado sushi roll. No matter what, make sure to order the tofu-avocado. The texture of both the avocado and the tofu was unrealistically creamy. Have never tasted tofu like that before! Dessert was a molten chocolate cake served with green tea ice cream. Again, the best I've ever tried of each. And a tofu cheesecake which is smooth, yet tart. Have heard the flan is incredible, but they were not making it that day. The interior is lovely.

I would definitely recommend trying this.After all that, we were stuffed!  I had expected the dishes to be small, but between two people, the portions were very hefty.  Needless to say, I'm kind of in love with this place and you should be too.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

This turned out to be great because we asked a lot of questions about the sake and our delightful server lead us around the menu with the skill and grace of a sommelier. We eventually decided on the flight of 6 different sake styles. My favorite was the undistilled- the cloudy one- we got a bottle of that next. we ate so many dishes and all were perfection but the two that stand out to me are the two I would have never ordered on my own:Uni don:  sea urchin and salmon eggs... omg so good! smooth and silky, better than I could have ever imagined. Unagi no shirayaki:  Eel... wow, light and slightly crispy. The unique flavor is unlike anything I have ever tasted before, but not in a strange sense. I thought right away that this is a taste I wish I had not had to wait 36 years to find. Another detail I like about the food presentation is the thought put into the garnish.

My friends dragged me to see the movie and I expected lotsa visual effects, no plotline, and a forgettable movie. But something unexpected happened...not only did I stay up to watch the entire film but I also enjoyed it.Similarly, a group of 8 of us went to EN for dinner, and I expected some mega-Japanese restaurant a la Megu with campy showmanship and mediocre food resulting in empty pockets. On top of that, it was New Years Eve so who knew what mood the kitchen staff might be in and how much more I'd be spending. But it's amazing how things surprise you when there's no hype. EN was one of the few restaurants offering a la carte for new years eve so my g/f and I opted to split four dishes, and most were surprisingly delicious: Soba noodles with warm duck broth (our favorite)--noodles were chewy and slurpworthy, the broth was hot and ducky (top chef reference), and the 3 pieces of duck breast in the soup were perfectly cooked.  Miso oden (a close second)--a hot pot of minced shrimp ball, root vegetables, tofu and beef tendon. The broth was earthy and a little sweet, the shrimp ball and tofu were comforting, and the somewhat odd combo of ingredients all worked well. Uni don got the most oohs and aahs when it came out (just imagine how good a steaming rice bowl with a gigantic piece of uni on top with salmon roe and nori would look), and it was creamy, sea-salty, and rich. But the taste could not match how unimaginably heavenly it looked. Freshly made tofu--this dish intrigued us the most as the menu described it as being made fresh 4 times per night. But I think I'll stick with normal tofu. This fresh tofu was more like a warm soy milk broth with pieces of tofu in it. It tasted okay but was pretty disappointing. The damage wasn't that bad as all of our dishes except the uni don were $15 or less, and service, while slow, was friendly and accommodating. The complimentary midnight sake toast was a unique touch, and as is Japanese tradition, we all got complimentary pieces of mochi, which we helped pound and ultimately make during the night.

There were six courses and standouts included the truffled octopus which almost brought tears to my eyes, and the lean tuna which had a complexity and depth of flavor I have never before experienced in tuna. Of excellent but perhaps not one of a kind quality were the shabu shabu, the custard, and the eel. I did not care for the lobster tempura which was overcooked and which used a green tea powder (fine on its own, but as there was another dish that used green tea in a better context, I felt that it was a bit of a failure). The tasting menu is definitely pricey, but well worth it. The service was impeccable, rigorously polite, with at least two servers bringing the dishes. At the same time, the service was not suffocating and my date and I were able to have an intimate space inside a very busy restaurant.

They must have a good deal on the rent.Food- As most have mentioned, the home made tofu is delicious, soft and creamy. I recommend an ample dose of the fish broth/soy sauce to give it some extra flavor once you've sampled it straight up.- The sashimi appetizer was fine but nothing special (see photo). The yellow tail was the stand out on this particular night. - The steamed whole perch was succulent. I would have this again.- They were out of the uni miso for the grilled giant squid but we took our chances anyway. It was served with a creamy sauce. The squid didn't stand a chance.- Same for the shrimp avocado salad - too much creamy dressing. Actually, I think they used the same dressing for the squid! Drinks- The plum flavored shochu went down smoothly. Be careful - it sneaks up on you. Service- The bartender at the front didn't seem to fit in.  He was also very distracted even though he only had 4 customers. - Same for the host. He was preoccupied with his computer instead of greeting us nicely.- Our waiter was patient, knowledgeable and well versed with all items on the menu.- They must have the dishwasher on overdrive. A fresh plate magically appeared every time mine was even slightly messy. Ambiance- I love the large main room but the combination of materials was a bit odd - carved wood, cement blocks, tree branches, miscellaneous objects and different color woods. I guess they were going for an eclectic mix but the overall effect was a bit disjointed in my opinion. Fortunately, the lighting complemented the room nicely so one really wouldn't notice unless you were specifically looking (what can I say - I knew I would be writing a review).- I like the seats around the center of the room. The table surface is a dark black marble and provides nice contrast for the food. You also have a good view of your fellow diners if you feel like checking out what they are eating.  There is pool of water in front of the table is peaceful but it felt like it could use a few fish or lilies.OverallI would go back to try a few more items on the menu but I'm not running.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

EN Japanese Brasserie is the restaurant week archetype. They understand the concept and so they do. They think about each single detail, They want to please you, They want you come back... and They get it with me. Someone who makes the best to amuse you, can't be wrong.First at all, just mention that the service was excellent, friendly and extremely correct. They also explain with detail and a big smile each of the dishes that they were presenting. 5 starts for them. Moreover, I'm sure they carefully study all the dishes presentation and the result is just perfect, perfect at the first sight, perfect in the details.  I had the feeling that serving temperature was perfectly studied. And just an example, they even take care of the orientation of the plate when comes to your table, suggesting which one must be eaten first, follow this suggestion because somehow it works.  Below a detailed description of my experience. Try it and Enjoy it!1. HANDMADE TOFU (freshly-made scooped tofu with wari joyu o-BanZaI) very nicely presented in a small wooden box, same as used for Sake, with a wooden ladle. Creamy and Firm; delicate flavor contrasting with the strong Ginger topping and the tasty soy/fish sauce in the bottom.  AWeSoMe.2. chef's selection of two Kyoto-style appetizers: before to describe it, just mention that under my view, temperature is a very important ingredient in some dishes. They know that and they take care for, and so they serve it cold, not too much not a little, just perfectly cold.               SHIRA AE (asparagus with a tofu and sesame dressing): very interesting. The asparagus was perfectly cooked, crunchy, very tasty and covered with a creamy sauce strongly marked for a sesame flavor. yeah, I do like it a lot.                KIRIBOSHI DAIKON (sun-dried daikon radish simmered in dashi). it was good. Although not something I dream for. 3- ONIGIRI and EN MISO SOUP The soup was very good. Tastier than a usual miso soup and comfortable. The soup looks to be the bridge to avoid a big contrast between the appetizers, cold and totally different style, to the hot and more consistent food. The Onigiri was just OK. Its a rice ball so it was dry, but too much; mostly I missed some dressing. 4a- SALKYO MISO GRILLED BLACK COD (black cod marinated in saikyo miso, grilled). So good. So fresh . So tasty. The fish totally laminates when you touched it. Very good and better than in many other places. However, I had before Black Cod at Omen so my request for this dish is very high. Have to mention that as side they serve small pieces of carrots which are crazy salty, but when you combine it with the fish...jezz.... I love it. 4b- one of my friends order the kakunI Berkshire (pork belly braised in sansho miso) instead the black cod. I'm not meat person and definitely not for pork. But he said it was amazing. And for those with big appetite this is what you have to order. Huge portion.      5- KISETSU NO ICE CREAM : Green tea ice cream. 1 ball coming in a cold bowl. Best Ice Cream I ever had. Coming for Spain I know about Ice cream, since its very popular there and same as Italian ice cream, which are some of the best. Well, I don't know how they do it but is amazing. I think they maybe use Soy milk? they achieve a new ice cream texture. Totally smooth with a delicate flavor. HEAVEN 6- Restaurant week Sake tasting. 3 samples. Light and fruity. Strong and delicate.

No, just a light meal, thanks. We told her this from the beginning. We ordered 3 salads, two forms of tofu, and 3 mini appetizer thingies and one large soup.  She said ""that will not be enough food for you.""  ok....that was weirdly offensive, but then we politely said we would order more if the time for that came.  we got our food and it really was penty-it wasn't a gluttonous feast, but it was truly very pleasantly satisfying.  She made one other comment about not enough food when she came to check on us, along with asking again if we wanted cocktails or anything to drink.  When she took our plates, my friend couldn't resist saying, ""that was a perfect amount of food, thank you!"" to which Yvonne T in her irksome voice said, ""Oh, you must have small stomachs."".  WHAT?! First of all, we are eating a light meal, yes, but since when is that a problem? Must we all get the 4 course tasting menu? it is 9pm on a week night, don't judge. Second of all, if you are so damn concerned about what we are eating, why didn't you mention that one dish was fried tofu, whereas we had already ordered a fresh tofu dish?  You could graciously point that out and suggest another type of dish.  Thirdly, stop with the drinks, already! i know you are trying to pad the bill in order to get a bigger tip, but joke is on you, as now I think the service sucks, and I don't want to give you a dime over 10%.Lastly, shut up Yvonne T.  I worked in the service industry, and when you don't agrree with someone or they are being rude, you suck it up.  You smile and kindly ask them what they want, then you complain about them when they are gone.

Not that I ever had it anywhere else but, now I know that I REALLY LOVE FIG ICE CREAM.!!   It is probably the best ice cream I ever had in my life.  No joke.  I thought green tea was my favorite flavor, but fig really just blows my mind.   I'm going to buy an ice cream maker just to make this ice cream myself.  Anyway, over all I think I really enjoyed it here.  The server was quite nice, giving us fresh hot tea at the end without us asking.  I like the little signs of appreciation.Although I wasn't going crazy over the food, I am quite curious to see how dinner would be.  I am definitely coming back to use my $20 coupon that was given (another sign of appreciation).  Oh yes, and to somehow steal the fig ice cream recipe from the chef.  :D",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Some disclaimers: DON'T come here if you're going to be cheap and complain about spending a lot of money. You WILL spend at least $100 each.

I don't understand how people say they left here famished.Ok, with that out of the way- we had a 9 o clock reservation, we were about 15 minutes late, and were seated right away. The gals all ordered martinis (white peach was incredible, lychee martini was great but very sweet). The boys got Sapporo (of course). For apps we got the fried chicken (and yes, like everyone else says, its so yummy), shrimp fritters, edamame (warning: its served cold, and has a smoked flavor. i enjoyed it but some ppl didn't), oysters (these apparently tasted delicious, but one of our party was sick afterwards and was convinced it was the oysters).For our ""entrees"" we each ordered a protein, then got some noodles and rice dishes for the table to share. The garlic fried rice was DELICIOUS, albeit VERY VERY VERY garlicky. You'll be burping it up in the morning. The thin wheat noodles with sesame dipping sauce came in 8 little portions per order, but it was pretty much cold angel hair pasta with a sesame/soymilk sauce. We were assuming it would be hot so we were a bit taken aback, but it tasted good regardless.A few of us ordered the lamb chops, which were delish. You get 3 smallish-sized chops per order. A couple of people got the organic chicken which was GREAT, charred and a pretty big portion. The rib eye steak comes in a dish that actually allows you to cook it at the table to your desired temp, which is cool. The Kobe beef was probably the smallest portion, but thats pretty standard anywhere when you get kobe, since its a more expensive beef. We didn't have ANY room for dessert, which should tell you something. The service was great, the waiters were really informative and helpful.

Edamame- soaked in dashi2. Tofu Salad- mizuna greens, cherry tomatoes & Japanese turnips with yuzu dressing3. Crispy fried chicken & vegetables- with aromatic rock salt4. Saikyo Miso Black Cod- black cod marinated in saikyo miso, grilled5. Kakuni braised Berkshire pork belly- in sansho miso, with a boiled egg, spinach & daikon radish6. Jako Gohan- steamed Japanese rice mixed with tiny dried fish7. Green Tea Ice CreamI would have to say the highlights of the meal were the crispy fried chicken and the pork belly.  I had extra servings of both.  The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  It had a great taste to it, not too salty and the lemon brought out the flavor really well.  The pork belly was very tender, it just had that melt in your mouth quality.  The rest of the menu was forgettable and I was underwhelmed by the other courses.  I've tasted better edamame and miso black cod and the choice of rice right before dessert seemed like an odd placement.  Hardly anyone touched it.    I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because although the space and decor were impressive, the food wasn't outstanding and the service was sub par.  Granted it was only $45.00 for 7 courses, but that could have been better spent elsewhere.  We had to wait a long time before our drink orders were taken.  We had the room reserved for 3 hours and yet the waiters kept bringing the next course even before we were finished with the previous one.  It would have been nice if they had let us savor each course and given us some time in between courses, rather than bringing out the next course too soon and letting it get cold an making us feel rushed.  I almost feel like we would have gotten better service if we weren't in a private room or didn't have a preset menu.  What made up for the food and service was the company. =)",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Don't think that this means the quality is low however. I'd put En's overall food quality just below Sakagura (both being a bit below Kyo Ya and Tsukushi). But hey, in the top 4 is still quite a feat! They make the entire tasting menu experience a no brainer. For each course you have the choice between two different dishes. Obvious answer: Go with a friend or date, both order the tasting menu, and one person take the left side, the other the right. I remember liking every dish, but it's been too long since my initial visit to remember all of the dishes I had. I can still remember that the black cod was amazing as was the udon (served over ice chips) and yellowtail sashimi. Also, the black sesame ice cream is the blackest sesameist richest I've had anywhere. The service is TOP NOTCH too. Orlando (the host) does a great job of making you feel like a special guest. He stops by a few times during your meal to make sure everything is going perfectly. If something's wrong, he will fix it. Despite the frequent visits, they never make you feel rushed. Take as long as you want to finish a dish, and like clockwork, once you finish it is whisked away and replaced with your next in an instant.

The space:The restaurant itself is a gorgeous loft space, with incredibly high ceilings, a large plant filled centerpiece that guests can sit around, very minimalist wooden tables, and little private curtained tables for large parties, where you can remove your shoes and kneel at the table in traditional Japanese style.The restaurant week menu was exciting because they offered everything but sushi, so it was a treat and change from the usual Japanese restaurant experience.The menu:We started off with handmade tofu with wari joyu (a delicious soy based sauce). If you typically have a texture issue with ""questionable"" foods this one would be tough for you, but it was delicious, but perhaps a little too mushy.Afterwards you receive two kyoto style dishes (traditional Japanese appetizers): Nasu Agebitashi- fried eggplant soaked in dashi topped with bonito (bonito is basically the name for various types of medium sized fish, dried bonito is used as a base for a traditional Japanese soup stock, most likely in the dashi served with this dish) andKiriboshi Daikon (sun-dried daikon radish simmered in dashi).As entrees, I split tried both theLobster No Uni Miso Yaki- grilled lobster with uni miso and theStone GrIlled Washugyu- Kobe-style rib eye steak served with ponzu citrus soy (which was served on a hot stone!)all of which was served with onigiri (white rice) & miso soup.The meal was finished off with delicious ice cream that had sesame seeds inside! It was delicious.And I mustn't forget the three-part saki flight to accompany the three course meal.

Very expensive, and objectionably ordinary. The sashimi was near $30 and consisted of 3 slabs of tuna, and 3 pieces each of two kinds of white fish. The cuts were not well executed, and the textures and tastes didn't impress as anything other than standard fare. At $3 a piece, with little variety and standard quality, I felt ripped off. The garlic fried rice was a gloopy, greasy affair with some dried herbal toppings on the side. $10! With tax and tip, nearly $50 for a most unsatisfactory delivery order.

I have since come back regularly, and must agree with the other reviewers that their service and food have seriously slipped.My last experience at En was terrible. I came in alone for dinner and ordered from the chef-tasting menu.  A few minutes later a couple arrived and started photographing the place (it is a nice restaurant), but then this bizarre woman started taking pictures of me eating. What? When is that ever ok? When I looked questionably at the staff, all eyes turned away and pretended as though they hadn't noticed (which is odd since everyone from the staff was watching her). Since nobody at En seemed to care about my obvious discomfort, I shot her boyfriend an angry look and she stopped.When my food arrived, the miso cod was good, but the skin was tough to cut through. The warm tofu was cold and more rubbery than I remembered it being. The organic chicken on hot stone was mediocre, as well as the green tea noodles.  So to end this awkward night, the manager brought out a dessert for the photo obsessed woman and her boyfriend on the house (for what, taking pictures of the restaurant)!?!?!?!?! I have been going to En for a year, and have never gotten anything on the house! Not even for my birthday. Never! I regularly spend about $100 every time I go there, and with my three friends we run the bill at $500! I know the wait staff, and never even received a free refill on my $8 tea! They force me to buy another one, and somehow the teakettles are always only half full.So to celebrate, the awkward woman starts taking more photos of the place, her boyfriend and me (Why? I honestly don't even know who she is).  When I finally got up to tell the hostess that I felt uncomfortable with the woman taking pictures of me, the reply was ""Yes, that is really awkward."" However, nothing was said to her, and I don't even think the staff remotely gave a damn. Needless to say, I can find better places to eat dinner that treat regular customers with respect (as they would an odd tourist who will probably go back home and never eat there again - smart business moves).",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

My brother-law-swears by their miso black cod, and now I know why -- it had asurprisingly rich, buttery, flavor for fish, and I loved it. (The shredded radish on the plate cut the richness nicely). There was also a course that reminded me of ramen, but without the noodles -- a tender cube of relatively lean pork belly in a hot flavorful broth with half a hardboiled egg and greens.

I'd been wanting to try EN for over a year but never had the chance. I finally made a reservation yesterday and went there for dinner with my boyfriend. First, the place is absolutely gorgeous. The dining room is huge with very high ceilings, and a beautiful communal table in the center, where you are likely to be seated if you're in a party of two. They also have small private rooms which you can reserve in advance, and I'm really hoping to get one of those next time I go.The food, which is Japanese, is tapas style, so my boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share. We got the kaiseki tasting menu, which includes seven dishes and also ordered a couple of other dishes a la carte. Quite honestly, not one single dish was disappointing, and almost all of them were just plain outstanding. The sashimi was fantastic, especially the yellow jack, which I don't think I'd ever had before (and their wasabi is obviously fresh and just great). The highlights of the meal were:- the grilled black cod: cod is usually a little plain, but this one was just amazing... very tasty, it just melts in your mouth.- the salmon chirashi: I didn't expect too much from a rice dish, but the salmon and salmon roe were just great.- the chicken meat balls: who would have ever thought chicken could be made that tasty?!- the grilled oysters: grilled tableside, in a thick miso sauce. I don't usually enjoy cooked oysters (though I really like them raw), but these were just so fresh that even cooked they still retained their original taste...Not to forget, the fig ice-cream we got for dessert was divine: very rich and creamy, and most likely made with fresh figs... possibly one of the best ice-creams I've ever tasted (and believe me, I know ice-cream).They also have a large drink selection. We shared a bottle of Kagatobi sake, which was really dry and quite nice, and also had a couple of martinis.

It was like watching a true artist perform.  When you see just how much time and skill is involved with the preparation of the food, you realize how important it is to savor each and every bite.  A good lesson learned for dining, and living, well.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

They label the drinks as ""dry"" or ""sweet"" so you can kind of guess on what you would like.  The sake were surprisingly good, and we got to pick out our shot glasses from a basket.Food wise, we ordered -- edamame soaked in dashi (REALLY different from other ones I've had, really flavorful)- crispy fried chicken with rock salt (tasted like my mom's fried chicken, so i wasn't completely OMGing it, but my boyfriend thought it was amazing)-Stone Grilled Wagyu Kobe-style beef (they used ponzu sauce so it was really light and the beef was very soft. they added scallions to it too which was a nice touch)-Gyu- Suki (sukiyaki. poached egg also served on the side. kind of rich for me and preferred the grilled wagyu- better.)-Garlic shiso fried rice (pretty good, but got tired of the flavor after a while)I think the most magical thing was the FLOURLESS CAKE with GREEN TEA ICE CREAM. I'm not a big fan of sweets, but the combination of chocolate melting in your mouth and green tea ice cream was to DIE for.

It's a huge space with high ceilings; I think it used to be a furniture warehouse? Don't quote me on that, but whatever it used to be, they did a fantastic job redecorating. If there arent any seats at the bar but still don't want to stare straight at your date, you can cozy up to the centerpiece (which, by the way, used to look a lot cooler with a funky stick design). Very unique. Great for groups, great for couples.The food is pricey, but often justified Their garlic rice is to die for. They make it fresh, so it takes about 20 minutes, but oh-so-worth it. Their homemade tofu is amazing, soft and creamy, completely different from regular tofu. Raw tuna and avocado salad with wasabi soy dressing tastes super fresh and comes highly recommended! If someone else at our table orders it, I have a hard time keeping my chopsticks out of their dish. Honestly, I'm not normally that rude.Most dishes are really solid, but they start to taste the same after awhile because they use a lot of ponzu sauce. I'm not complaining, ponzu is great, but I like more variety, especially if we're eating a lot of smaller dishes. I'd also recommend against the raw wagyu beef, its $38 for only a few slices. Plus it tasted hard and practically frozen, not red and fleshy like I like. Maybe there's something special about it that I'm not getting, but I didn't think it was worth it.Another thing -- their private rooms look AMAZING and I wanted to book one for my boyfriend's birthday. The problem is, they will only serve prixe fixe meals in the private rooms, which is unfortunate because 1) I wouldn't be able to have the things I love, like the tuna salad and garlic rice, and 2) because no one likes to be forced to pay $50+ and have zero choices about their meals.

Once we made it the table we quickly asked if the homemade tofu was still available since it only available at certain times of the night. We ordered a bottled of saki and the waiter brought us a basket where we could choose from all kinds of saki glasses.Two of us decided on the tasting menu that was $100. We had samples of 12 entrees and ice cream for dessert. The only think that I didn't like was the fish cake.

Unfortunately, we didn't get to sit in the main dining room, but the lounge seating around is also really cool. First of all, the cocktail menu is fabulous! I started with the sparkling lychee. SO delicious! Sparkling pinot noir with lychee juice with a big, plump lychee on the bottom. Next, I moved onto the white peach martini. The martini was poured over muddled and slushed white peaches. Scrumptious! Then I had the ginger martini. Infused ginger soju was bitter in the beginning, but it had a sweet finished. As for dinner, we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We started with the homemade tofu. Warm, soft tofu in soy milk were served in a pot with a side of condiments of daikon, scallions, and dry seaweed. It was SO silkly smooth. Next, we had the beef tataki. Slices of fillet mignon were slightly seared (mostly raw) and served with apple ginger dipping sauce. The beef was so tender and the sauce had a sweet and sour taste. I really enjoyed the dish. Then we had the grilled black cod, which was my favorite! The fish was so buttery soft and delicious! For our sushi, we had the spicy tuna with okra and the spicy tempura crab with avocado and tobibiko. The sushi was served with two special dipping sauces, but I preferred using traditional soy sauce. The spicy tuna was really good and the use of okra was really unique. Dessert was wonderful! The flourless chocolate cake was to die for! It tasted more like a souffle and the green tea ice cream was the perfect compliment. The red bean soup with mochi was really good! I really liked the ""grilled"" mochi balls that were floating on top of the warm red bean ""soup."" Along side was a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

1007,8L-VLUQ6bRrY8DDTLR4DAQ,Felipe V.,3.0 star rating,"I'll start off with the positive aspects of EN before going into details of our meal.  The size and decor of the restaurant are epic.  I felt I was eating in the grand hall of a museum or indoor garden.  The ceilings must be 30' high.  The staff is also extremely attentive and polite, and knowledgeable of what they're serving you (though also very quiet, so it can be hard to hear their explanations).I could be biased in this review as I had been thinking all day that we'd be eating at a steak house, so was slightly (too put it lightly) disappointed by the fact we were eating Japanese food...so maybe some of the let down shows through in the descriptions.  We ordered various cocktails, and they were pretty good.  My friend's Lychee Martini was exceptional, and the Showa (maker's with ginger infused honey and ginger ale) started off strong, but near the bottom of the glass ended with a sickly sweet syrup.We all decided to try the Kaeda (which was a 6 course meal and dessert) which had some ups and down.   The first dish consisted of 3 small plates of various vegetarian options...they were all ok, though I was surprised by the texture and taste of one of the apps as I totally thought it was meat (so points for that).The second plate consisted of sashimi.  The Yellow Tuna and Salmon were fantastic in every respect.  Fatty, fresh tasting, well coloured and great texture.  Definitely would envision myself returning just for the sashimi/sushi they serve.The third course was the glazed cod that was also incredibly delicious.  A not too heavy buttery taste that melted in your mouth.  The only thing I did not understand was the scoop of finely chopped radish which had no flavour, and added nothing to the dish.Next, was the hand-made tofu.  Now, I rarely eat tofu, so it could have been just my inexperience, but this dish really was one of the least appealing substances I've ever been served.  First off, it looks like flan, but without the caramelized sugar top.  It also has the same consistency.  A semi-solid pus-yellow mass, and once its in your mouth, you realize how much of a mistake it was to try it.  To say it lacks any flavour gives it too much justice.  There's a distinct taste to this tofu which I can maybe only describe as what I imagine wet dirty paper to taste like.  They try to mask this taste by providing you a bowl full of soy sauce, but it somehow does not even begin to compensate for this globule of colourless mush...but it's healthy right!  moving on...The 5th dish was a pork belly, with spicy mustard, what I think was a boiled potato wedge and half a hard boiled egg all in a bit of broth.  Nothing was particularly wrong with the dish, I could just not wrap my head around the concept.  I tried a bit of everything together, and i tried each piece separately, and neither option was better than the other.  The pork belly though was extremely tender and was nicely spiced, but it just rather reminded me of the meat stews my mother would make when I was a child.The final course was rice (with barley?) and some salmon cooked on top, and a separate bowl of broth that you poured as you wished into the rice.  Again, nothing wrong with this dish.  The rice was nicely cooked, and the salmon tasted fine, but I didn't find any of it too be particularly titillating.The dessert consisted of a single scoop of green tea ice cream.  The density or maybe tensile strength (not really sure what is the proper descriptor for the phenomena I'm trying to describe) of this ice cream was kind of amazing.  It was thick, and trying to cleave a portion of ice cream from the scoop was rather difficult as the rest of the scoop seemed impelled to stay together.  Also, Green Tea ice cream has a real subtle taste, like too subtle.  It was a nuanced taste, which is not what I want in ice cream.  I want an over-powering taste.  I want a flavour that lingers in my mouth.  This ice cream was to taste, what seeing a ghost is to sight...In the end, one star is taken away by that tofu dish, plus the plain finish of the final 3 dishes.  Another star is taken because of the price.  Total cost per person was $113.00, and for that, I totally could have had great wine, pop-overs, brussel sprouts, hash browns and an amazing rib-eye at a great steakhouse in the city.  But, now at least I know.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Come on, $20 for a unagi roll?  Who are these people trying to kid?  I mean, yes, it is in west village and all but....

Last night I chose an eggplant appetizer for $8 that ended up being exactly a 3 inch long, two inch tall stack of eggplant slices. It was about half the size of a brownie, which was surprising. Sure, it was tasty but I'm not sure I want to pay $8 for three bites of eggplant that's not coated in truffles or caviar or gold flakes. That's seriously my only complaint in regards to EN. Everything else is stellar. The interior is hip and super gorgeous, the waitstaff attentive and very nice. The food is delicious and very fresh (they make their own tofu on premesis so be sure to get the fresh tofu). Some notable dishes:-Fresh tofu (not the tofuskin in yuzu, that's literally $12 for two bites of skin)-Mochi potato croquette (sticky rice encasing braised duck on a bed of pillowy potato, it looks small but is very filling)-Oysters braised in front of you in a red miso sauce-Soymilk hot pot, it sounds weird, but cooking meat and vegetables in soymilk really adds a silkiness and richness to them.

The tofu is like a pudding swimming in a pool of soymilk.  Yes, I even 'drank' the milky liquid san the accompanied soy/fish sauce.  As I noted that I'm a vegetarian, the waiter was kind enough to offer a vegetarian version of soy sauce.  Since I didn't order a lunch set, I decided to order another dish so not to look 'cheap'.  I selected the tofu salad without the jako ($9).  It was so interesting that the fresh tofu was 'massaged' into the mizuna greens.  I thought it was well orchestrated and after eating that salad, I felt I didn't even need to order the tofu appetizer.  But hey, got to try at least once.  My eating partner decided on the miso black cod set. Wise choice. The fish was perfectly grilled and well seasoned.  The set also included small dishes of salad, miso soup, sansai, some pickles, and even a small dish of cold tofu.  The waiter also took the time to point out all the dishes for us so we know what we're eating.  It wasn't a cheap lunch, but the atmosphere was nice and quiet (I'm sure this place is better valued as a night scene).  Although the food is 'mostly' authentic Japanese cuisine, the surrounding is more fusion-liked, especially with the Latin music in the background.  That made the oriental experience kind of 'off' for me.  I was surprised how much the tofu filled me up, (but hey, soy is a protein).  The food is clean, healthy, and filling.  Come during lunch to have a zen experience because at night, you're more tempted to succumbed to the bottles of sake surrounding the restaurant.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

The mains were very good, I got the miso cod and my husband got the chicken.  Both were very tasty.

The restaurant is beautiful and the whole staff is very welcoming & attentive. Our reservations were early in their dinner service, so we got to enjoy the music they were playing -- great old jazz like Ella and Frank Sinatra -- for the first 30-45 minutes of our meal. Once the place started to fill up it was a little hard to hear the music.My husband got the Biho sake (which he thoroughly enjoyed) and I ordered their ""Ginger"" drink which is made with ginger syrup they craft in-house -- delicious! I ordered the Soyo Kaze which is six courses plus dessert. My favorites were the miso black cod (so tender & perfectly seasoned), stone grilled chicken (sizzling and smelled divine) and the warm soba noodles (not the thick, coarse noodles I was expecting -- they were thin and by far the best soba I've ever had). My husband got the miso black cod entree (and loved it as much as I did) and the 16 piece Nigiri sushi set. He said all of the fish was super fresh and that the salmon roe was clean tasting and not at all salty (like at a lot of places). We finished the evening with pumpkin ice cream (included with my meal), the chocolate trio (the mousse and ice cream were soooo good) and a French press pot of killer coffee.It is expensive to eat here if you go all out, but that's true of most if not all nice restaurants in the city.

Really, even when looking, it's not readily apparent that such a good (and big) restaurant is hiding behind those walls.The person that seats you announces your presence by yelling out a, presumably, Japanese phrase and the cook staff responds in kind. It's mildly unsettling if you're not expecting it, but it becomes a rather endearing part of the din as others are seated during your meal.They offer a variety of unique menu options or, at the very least, add a creative twist to more familiar dishes like the delicious miso soup with crab. The avocado and baby shrimp salad isn't exciting, per se, but definitely very tastey. There was an asaparagus, beef and tofu in wasabi appetizer as part of the restaurant week prix fixe meal that, while very simple in appearrance, tasted awesome.

I was waiting on the corner of Kenmare and Lafayette for my date to meet me. There I was, smoking a cigarette waiting for her to arrive when I caught her in the corner of my eye crossing the street. I will never forget what I saw because she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I caught myself staring at her as she crossed the street when I realized I should probably meet her half way instead of having her walk all the way to me. And then I realized. I am lucky. To have a woman this beautiful on my arm for the evening accompanying me to dinner. We arrived at En, and this was the second time I'd been here. My first experience was exceptional and I had gone to dinner with a few co-workers when I first started. It was a way of introducing me to everyone. The first time I went I remember noting to myself that I wanted to take someone special here one day because it was almost perfect. And I'm glad I finally got a chance to do so, and couldn't have picked a more wonderful woman. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we arrived on the dot. We sat at the Sake bar for a couple minutes while they prepared our table. The high ceilings, intimate lightning and wonderful aroma of food gave En a majestic feel. It is romantic, with small quiet chatter throughout the space. I couldn't take my eyes off of my date as we sat at the bar and made some small talk as we waited to be seated. The hostess approached and escorted us to our table. It was unfortunately in the smaller dining room in the front. I had hoped for a table in the main room where it's stunningly decorated. As we walked by, I could sense that everyone watched her walk by. She turned heads. And it's obviously no question as to why she would. I was just happy enough to be the one with her and not the one wishing I was. We sat down and she took off her coat to reveal a seductive dress. We had a corner table and a lamp was placed there. It reflected off her skin giving her a warm and inviting glow complimenting her hair and eyes. Despite her assets ... her true beauty was with her eyes. Though I'm sure  any man would be caught looking at her neck line, I was preoccupied with getting lost in her eyes. Corny, I know. But it's the truth. The service at En is one of the best. I ordered for the both of us and while she got a white wine, I settled with the Seppun. A delicious citrus flavored drink that not only compliments the food, but also serves as a nice treat for your taste buds. We started with the Edamame, served cold with a light touch of salt. They tasted fresh and had great flavor, despite the rudimentary preparation. Our second course was the Minced Duck which was served on a leaf on top of a burning clay pot which cooked in front of us, tantalizing our olfactory senses with wonderful blends of duck and scallions. Though the crackers were admittedly a bit tough, the duck ended up tasting great and we took down the whole serving. Team work! We followed that up with the stone grilled organic chicken which was succulent, tender, and broke apart in your mouth. She was going through her wine glasses as I was going through my Seppuns and we were making great conversation. She told me about her dreams and what she wanted to do. She had a great vision and the confidence to prove she could do it. What a turn on. I took a more passive role, listening to everything she had to say. I wanted to learn everything about her and she obliged. Our final course was two sushi rolls, the Tuna Avocado and the Salmon Avocado roll. After she finished her first bite, she looked at me, eyes completely wide (and omggg so sexy), and remarked that it was the best sushi she's ever had. I couldn't help but smile because I just wanted to make her happy and thanks to En, it seemed to be going in my favor. The service was top notch. Truly experienced wait staff who never interrupted when it seemed inappropriate or when we were in mid-conversation. They came only when it looked as if we had a down time or a pause in the middle of things. They cleared the table in a timely manner to prepare for the next course, and they refilled my water even when it was only half full. I never had to ask for the check, and they gave us plenty of time to talk and order a couple more drinks and continue conversing. When it did come, my date politely excused herself so that I could handle the bill. I thought that was very classy, and something all women should take note of. When she came back, we were ready to hop across the street to Lelabar to have a few more drinks. En is in a great location that also has Sweet Revenge right around the corner for some after dinner desert. I've recommended this place highly to anyone asking for a Japanese place, and I'll stick to my guns in recommending it again to all my Yelpers.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

From outside, you can't imagine how large the restaurant is. Unlike most restaurants, En doesn't crowd the tables next to each other, so there's a great amount of breathing room and you don't have to sit on top of the table next to you. That coupled with the soaring ceilings results in a restaurant that's trendy, but not obnoxiously loud -- I think it's great for groups and for couples' meals.If you want to get your money's worth and get the best food En has to offer, stick to the small plates they have to offer -- avocado/tuna salad, moshi croquette (possibly the best dish in the house!), gama dofu, grilled squid, salmon rice pot with salmon roe, fried chicken, etc. And if you're going to get a yummy drink, try their mojito -- it has a unique and flavorful (girly) taste!For the quality of food you get, I think En's very reasonably priced -- for a 3-person dinner, including 2 desserts, that left us completely full and satisfied, the tab only came to about $140 (less tip and tax).",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

We were given the menus and a server came over to offer us tap or bottled water. I love the spacious layout of the restaurant due to it having an industrial loft feel.

I ordered the Grilled Squid with Uni sauce, Sea Bass and Shitake mushroom wrapped Filet Mignon roll. My SO had the Black-cod, 6 piece Sashimi with Rice and Mushroom and Miso soup. Everything was very lovely although the portions are small so be prepared in case you are hungry. The Sashimi was all very fresh and lovely but it was the usual Salmon, Fluke and Tuna that can be found at any Japanese sushi restaurant. The dessert that came with the RW menu is Green Tea ice-cream. We felt that they could've offered something more ingenious than just Green Tea ice-cream.

Decided to come during a weekday lunch. I went solo so I ended up getting two lunch sets for myself so I could actually reach hit $40 on the voucher. Ordered the fried chicken set and the sushi set. I'd say the food was great. The fresh tofu (came with the chicken) as others have noted is very good as was the fried chicken. The sushi set for lunch was great as well. Overall I think the lunch set prices were ok but not cheap (~$15 to $25 or more). Obviously I couldn't finish all of my food so I had the chicken wrapped. Interior is nice/modern and is very large with a large open kitchen. Would definitely come back for dinner at some point. The one negative I'd say is they seemed understaffed that day for with only two servers. Everything seemed extremely rushed. The servers litterally were walking very fast everywhere and even when they dropped things off at my table they were rushing. For instance when she brought the tea I ordered she laid in on table so fast that some of water spilled over on the table. When she came to deliver a udon to a person next to me she dropped it off so fast the tempura pieces fell off the top of the udon onto the tray. I'm not being super critical here, but they should slow it down or at least get fully staffed. Maybe someone called in sick and they were short-handed, who knows.

These dishes are *supposed* to taste that good in my mind).The gobo was not what I expected.

And guess what, the iichiko bottle was cheaper than it is at my dive issakaya in SF. I am going to have a talk with them....That brings me to the final good point.

This was my first experience with uni and En could not have perfected it any better. My friend is a huge uni/sushi fan and ordered a special roll of sweet ebi, avocado and topped with a mound of uni and black caviar. The creamy texture was a lot to take in (good thing we all shared). The ebi was so fresh that it literally exploded into my mouth, before melting into an abyss of delicacy. My entree was the miso cod- it was sweet, tender and buttery, but not in the rich sense. The portions are small but everything is so carefully prepared that you truly want to savor each bite. A friend got the sea bass, which was great but a little too fried for me. Same goes for the shrimp fritters- nothing to jump around about. The sushi for two platter was done well, everything was very fresh. To top it off, the dessert was amazing.

The space is beautifully decorated. We're brought to the counter seats looking at the open kitchen, but I didn't want to look at a pile of plates while dining - they seem like part of decor, but still... The host kindly moved our seats when I requested to the seating areas in the center. A couple of cons about the restaurant. The restaurant is overall too dark - it was hard for me to read the menu. And I am not sure if the 60's music being played was suitable for the atmosphere and it was just too loud. The menu had a great selection of traditional Japanese cooked food. We tried a variety of food from the restaurant week menu and regular menu. Homemade tofu was delicious, but I would not order off of the regular menu for $9 for a scoop. The black cod was yummy and marinated just right. - I ordered this again when we went back second time. My boyfriend had a Kaiseki (7 course fixed menu), and the food didn't seem that much, but at the end of meal, he was full. The Kyoto style appetizers were good. I found them very similar to Korean side dishes, just in more subtle flavor. The lobster tail tempura was so tasty and crisp. The grilled young bamboo shoot was unexpected and interesting. Kobe style rib eyes are so juicy and full of flavor. On a second visit, I tried okonomoyaki since I am a big fan of it. It's made out of all veggie which is fine by me, but I didn't like the consistency - it was too mushy. The kumamoto oysters in ponzu sauce were refreshing and a good deal. Lastly, the dessert. I got green tea ice cream and he had rice cake and red beans w/ ice cream. We combined them together in a bowl and shared. Yummm.. It's like shaved ice with red bean, ice cream, and rice cake. I've loved this dessert since childhood. It was great to see a high-end restaurant like EN incorporating this old and common dessert into their dessert recipe. Overall, this place is a great Japanese restaurant when you're looking for alternative Japanese food other than sushi. I wouldn't go there for sushi as they don't have many selection of fish and the freshness is just OK.

I could eat this stuff everyday.  It's such a great way to finish off the meal.  The service is professional though not the best; on my last visit, they completely forgot about one of our orders.  I love the lofty modern feel and though I've never dined in any of them, the private rooms in the back and upstairs would probably be great for groups.  Hmmm... perhaps I'll plan the next group birthday party or something over there.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

To be fair, the ambiance is very nice, if you don't mind sitting in a sushi bar configuration with a group of people you don't know. We both ordered the $65 tasting menu, but we asked to substitute the pork belly for tuna because my wife is vegetarian. The waitress said that would be OK, but that we would have to pay the difference in price between the 2 dishes, which was understandable. The first 3 small appetizers which come at once were very good. The Sashimi was OK, the black cod dish was also OK, but not at all on par with the one Nobu does, or even the one that I make at home. The tofu was very nice. The ""Toro"" tuna that my wife got was honestly so tough that I was unable to nibble off a little bit to try it. The waitress assured me that this was ""normal"" for high quality tuna. Portions were small, except for the plate of cold noodles with dipping sauce. That was apparently the dish that was intended to keep the patrons from complaining that they were still hungry when they left. When we got the check we found that we had been charged twice for the pork belly and Tuna. Sorting that out required the begrudging assistance of the manager, and even then, she tried to nickel and dime us on the difference in price.  After we left, neither one of us felt well, and my wife got mild stomach cramps.

There is a tree in the center of a water fountain, where there is a bar type setting. It was so gracefully done that I didn't feel awkward sitting next to stranger. They had a great selection of cocktails and a wonderful wine list, I was a little daring and tried the ""Green Tea"" martini but it made me a tad nauseas and ordered a glass of wine and they took it off the bill which was very surprising. The menu, which was endless, featured more cooked items as opposed to extravagant sushi dishes. The combinations and ingredients that were used were not ones that I normally associate with Japanese cuisine but it was pleasing to my palate. My friend and I shared a soybean with ground pork in lettuce wraps, and rare Kobe beef dipped in an apple chutney sauce. They were good, but some ingredient was missing that I couldn't put my finger on it. The idea of this restaurant is to share different appetizers so in doing that, we ended up finishing with the duck, which was odd because it was simply duck on a stone plate with a miso sauce on the side, and a shrimp tempura sushi roll served with tarter sauce.

The first time I went, it was on an expense account, and there was probably not much we didn't order. The food and alcohol just kept coming and I thougt I'd died and gone to heaven.My personal favorite was the sauteed duck breast. The second time I went, I tried the $100 tasting menu. That was also excellent though no duck. Probably not a place for most people to go on a regular basis, but worth the once-in-a-while treat.

1128,5fdw-LMSC6mhrjg6KdBLnw,Candice B.,4.0 star rating,"I had very high hopes for EN.  I researched on yelp extensively for a good Japanese restaurant to splurge on for the NYC trip.  My boyfriend and I starved ourselves knowing we will be ordering the chef's special.  Decor deserves more than 5 stars.  I loved it.  Despite what they say about how there is only a communal table for non-private-party diners on Opentable, they might have recently added another room in the front where you can sit at individual tables.  My boyfriend wanted to sit at the communal table to join the fun: that room was much brighter with that huge modern chandelier and you can see part of the kitchen.  Unfortunately I spoke too soon and we went with a small table in the outer room.  It's much quieter and darker.  The ceiling is really high and there are wooden works up on the wall that are so grand they reminded me of the big Temple in Nara.  They clearly put a lot of thought into the ambiance.  There is even a teapot hanging way up high that projected a small shadow on the wall.  Interesting. The service was strange.  The waitress wasn't necessarily horrible but not very personable or warm at all.  She was surprised that I wanted more hot water for my sencha tea.  What?  I can't be the first person to ever want more hot water for my tea pot!  I wouldn't fuss over little attitude things like this if I were eating at some cheapy place.  But if I were going to pay $200 for two people, I expect absolutely perfect service.  The food was good.  Just not mind blowing.  we started with 3 small appetizers: some konbu (plum sauce way too strong for someone who isn't eating it with heavy drinking), daikon, and some other veggie that I couldn't tell.  Then we went on to sashimi, hamachi, tuna and another fish that I again couldn't tell because I couldn't understand what the waitress was saying.  Oh well, they were good.  Third course was either tempura or shrimp fritter and fried sea bass.  Tempura was fine, sea bass was great, but shrimp fritter was really bland and boring.  Fourth course was grilled black cod or filet mignon.  Filet mignon was tender but not sure what made it Japanese.  Black cod was buttery but I have had better.  Fifth course was yuba sashimi and wheat cakes.  Yuba sashimi was very interesting and tasted more like cheese than tofu.  Wheat cakes were really interesting too and came in two tiny bites.  Gelatin like and tasty.  Sixth course was pork belly or sea bass with lotus root.  Pork belly was tasty as was the sea bass.  But I wished there wasn't wasabi in both of them.  The pungent flavor really overpowered the two dishes.  Nevertheless, the sea bass with lotus root was probably my favorite dish of the evening. Seventh course was rice with salmon roes or cold noodles.  My boyfriend didn't' enjoy his rice because it had some sort of herb taste to it.  My noodles were really chewy and great.  However, by now, we were both so stuffed that we could barely move or eat.  I couldn't believe how big these dishes were!  It took me a lot of time and strength to finish.  Finally ice cream.  We had fig and black sesame.  Fig ice cream actually tasted like fig!  I thought it was just gonna be sweet ice cream.  One thing I did love about EN was their beautiful presentation.  Each dish came in different and exquisite containers.  Food arrangement was also lovely and artful. My boyfriend didn't like how fast the dishes came.  Some came slightly before we were done with the previous course.  Again, very minor imperfections only applicable for fancy pants restaurants like this.  The crowd was interesting.  Nearly everyone wore black and there is something very uniform about all of us but I can't pinpoint why.  A lot of couples which I can completely understand, because if I wanted to woo someone at a quiet, beautiful place with soft jazz, I'd take them here too.  There were also a lot of Japanese business men.  I imagine them to be far away from home near the Holidays, slightly homesick after a long day of work, and wanted some homey bar food.  And because everything is on business account, they decided to come to this high end joint for some dinner.  I wonder if this strange mixture of elegant ambiance and humble homeyness was satisfying for them.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

1135,OJci8jWxKrzeltRb0FUTZA,Judy H.,1.0 star rating,"Wow we will never go back to this place. There were two major problems: food and service. To a certain extent, our problem with the food was just that we ordered some of the wrong things. If that was the only problem though, I'd say that we might come back sometime with a more careful ordering plan. But in addition to the food itself, it took forever to GET the food, so all our hating on the food was multiplied by fuming over how long it was taking.  By the end, we were so irritated that we started planning our yelp review.Food: We got the himawari, uni don, toretate yasai, and mochi croquette.  The himawari and mochi croquette were fine. But we absolutely hated the uni don -- maybe that's our fault though for not knowing that sea urchin tastes like rotten sea mush. Then the toretate yasai, which is described on the menu as ""organic seasonal summer vegetables with a maguro shuto based bagna cauda"" was a huge disappointment. It sounds nice enough from the description, we thought maybe some greens and stuff cooked with some sauce thing. But in fact, the dish is just some raw vegetables, carefully separated into piles, on a huge bowl of ice with some japanese-style ranch dressing. Maybe we should have asked the waitress to explain this dish but I guess it never crossed my mind that a $16 dish could consist of one halved shallot, 4 mini carrots, 4 pieces of asparagus, 3 pieces of romaine lettuce, 4 pieces of daikon, 4 pieces of cucumber, and 2 slices of lotus root (also: are any of those ""summer seasonal vegetables""?). Eating a bunch of raw vegetables when you're at a restaurant expecting that you'll get to eat things you don't have to COOK yourself, is really tiresome and unpleasant. Especially the giant romaine leaves -- each one was like another frozen, tasteless peak to conquer, and all the Asiatic ranch dressing in the world wasn't going to soften the fact that it would have been better to eat salad from a bag. How is this even a valid dish to serve?  Maybe one of the cooks was just like, I'm tired of cooking? Or perhaps he was just arranging his ingredients when some miscreant stole away with his materials and brought them to us. Service: maybe it was because we were using a groupon or because the only drinks we ordered was some tea, but it took us 3 hours to finish our meal.  The place was not packed and we were not lingering over the food, or drinks, or each other. It just took forever for dishes to come out.  For example, after the pork belly had been cleared, we waited 20 minutes before the cold noodles with some scallions came out. How can that take so long?  Then, it seemed like the people around us were getting served a lot faster: the people to the right of us arrived when we were about 1/3 of the way through but nearly caught up to us -- they would have been done before us but they lingered over their tofu course (Amusing digression about this couple, who seemed like they were having a pretty good time: When they got their sashimi course, it included a raw shrimp. This caused the dude no small degree of consternation, and he barely controlled the volume of his voice when saying ""This thing has fucking EYES ON IT! That's weird."" Luckily, his girlfriend was real level-headed and said things like ""the eyes are all part of the shell, did you know that?"")

1138,GAVuoIxcejoX62YJlWqhaQ,Ls Y.,5.0 star rating,"EN isn't anyone's idea of a cozy local restaurant, but on the menu are a few comfort food items perfect for a casual bar meal. Yes, I've tried the fresh unagi (it was good, but worth 35? Not a chance) and I'm in love with the fresh tofu, but those items don't exactly warm the soul on a chilly evening. On my second visit to EN, I decided to get comfortable at the bar and settle in for the evening. My first order with the bartender wasn't for a glass of wine or beer, but for the 40-minute lead time salmon rice claypot. I'd wanted to try it before, but wasn't sure about hanging around EN's bar on a friday night for what is essentially fish and rice, but it was a quiet Tuesday, and what else was I going to do? A few minutes later after the bartender (there's only one for that entire restaurant during the week) got around to serving the drinks, I ordered up the sea bass and cold soba with the warm duck dipping broth. The sea bass arrived fried with a light batter and sans sauce or spices, only a lemon and fried shisito pepper as garnish. It didn't need anything else. No tempura sauce, no ponzu sauce -- just a squeeze of lemon made the dish how I always want fish and chips to taste: a balance of crisp and slightly seasoned batter and a mild yet moist flakey fish. The soba noodles were good (served on ice is a bit dramatic for me) but it was the duck broth that made the dish. Instinctual prescience told me to reserve the duck broth for the rice, and I was right. The claypot rice is totally worth the 40 minute wait, but coupled with the duck broth from the soba disk it becomes transcendent. I could go on, but really you have to try it for yourself.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"

Rather, she could barely apologize and tried to maintain some form of attitude which she cannot pull off.  We asked for the manager and were told it was her - quite a surprise that she could be a manager.  We told her we were leaving and she still hasn't quite caught on how to treat customers - bills us for our drinks.  Paid and left.  Would never return to this place.  Seats are really low and terribly uncomfortable and this ""manager"" has no idea how to manage.   Above all, food was surprisingly poor quality on this tasting menu.  There are a million better places to go - save your time and money.",EN Japanese Brasserie,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Diners,, Bars"
