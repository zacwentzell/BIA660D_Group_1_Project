The dumplings were delicious; perfect size with the right amount of pork inside. Also, the dipping sauce gives a nice  kick to it. The beef with broccoli was also tasty and was a pretty generous portion for the price. I am so glad I don't have to travel to Chinatown to satisfy my Chinese food craving. I can honestly say I found my go to take out place and will definitely be coming back!",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
1,gjQvWPOi-FEhN35YPnB7Pg,Barbara M.,4.0 star rating,"Pleasantly surprised.  I avoided this place for a long time because I made a judgement about its location.  I read a couple of recent reviews and decided to give it a try. Order was called in. No problem.  Reasonably priced. Delivered in 24 mins.  Steamed dumplings and house special lo-mein. It arrived hot. The ginger and pork in the dumplings was in good proportion to the dumpling.  It was tasty. The dipping sauce was good. 8 dumplings is a nice portion..The lo mein had real chicken, pork, beef and baby shrimp.  The noodles were cooked well in brown sauce.  The veggies were crisp and good.I am pleased with the meal and the choice.The delivery guy was all about business.  No calls ahead. He was prepared with change and was happy to get a tip.I didn't receive any napkins or implements to eat the food.  Guess I have to request that. I will find that out.",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
2,dugA_rKOfCPu4Wdj5Rtt7g,Ashleigh O.,5.0 star rating,"I used to order from here as a child as my parents loved it. It was always good. When we moved I missed the place a lot but heard they closed down when I visited. Apparently that is not the case and it was temporary because I moved back and have ordered here several times. Amazing food. I've been to Kwok's, Jade Wok, Good Year Chinese, Garden State, etc, and their food doesn't compare. The only reason Mr. Rice isn't more popular is because they refuse to partake in online ordering a la Seamless or Grubhub. Their veg dumplings are huge and have mushrooms which is a rarity in the area, the lo mein is flavored perfectly, their moo shu pancakes are the freshest in the area. No MSG or frozen food here. Yeah, the place itself is not much but that shouldn't mater when the food is so great!",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

4,AesKzN01amY9vVUQ0DhlMA,Katy W.,4.0 star rating,"The prices and food are pretty good. Ordered delivery here, they said 45 mins but it was at least an hour wait. The good thing is that the food was still piping hot and delicious.*Note: Pt size orders come in 2 containers, 1 small box for rice, and a separate container for your dish. I'd say it's a moderate portion size. (If you're looking to share, I suggest getting Qt sizes.)Menu photos are current as of 12/28/2015.",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
5,d2AH_5GUjLZwKzW7hkyESw,Louise R.,4.0 star rating,"Whoever said this looks like a backalley dump from the outside is correct. The inside isn't any better except the tables to sit at were wiped down which is why we decided to eat inside instead of in the car.  My sister got the chicken lo mein which was one of the best I've ever tasted. The front desk staff was super sweet and when I argued with my sister about asking for NO Veggies, the front desk lady defended her and said most of her clientele request that. That has to directly correlate with the rate of diabetes in jersey city. I ordered shrimp soup with noodles which I have to admit, the broth was super bland. I added four packets of hot sauce however the shrimp were super fresh and perfectly cooked and there were about 10 of them in a quart. It would've been perfect had I requested wonton broth with the same contents of shrimp, noodles and veggies. With two cans of gingerale and a shrimp roll, it was only 13 $. So the look, feel and decor of actual restaurant is like 1 star. The staff 5 stars even though they supported my sisters unhealthy choices. The food 4 stars because of amazing lo mein and bland soup. I wouldn't make a special trip back here for the food, but I definitely get why the locals are all about it.",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

I enjoyed the lo mein a lot, and the beef and broccoli was great. Veggies were nice and crunchy. The pupu platter was plentiful, especially for the price. What a deal.

12,1tW2S8tIHIoQQ0fFYeBr6A,Rone H.,4.0 star rating,"We eat Mr Rice regularly. Had it last night as a matter of fact. We try to eat Halal but at this place pork is definitely on the menu, but it is possible to avoid it if you wish. We ordered the four seasons minus the pork with Broccoli instead of mixed vegetables. We also ordered the general  Tso's chicken with Broccoli. Both dishes with white rice. Shrimp toast and crab Rangoon on the side. Food is really good and fresh.  They will also work with you on your order to keep it as far away from pork as possible. I would give 5 stars if they were completely Halal like Amins. They really could be Halal because of the area they are in. If they were to go completely Halal they could own the Market.",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

They are right across the street from me, and I go there all the time.Good chicken and broccoli and other basic Chinese staples. Wonton soup is pretty solid as well. It's not the prettiest place but they get the job done!",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
14,0KemD-cJqj2gBAaBMk8m3A,Melinda P.,4.0 star rating,"I've ordered from this place ALL MY LIFE. At one point they closed for a year to move over two houses down, BUT when I heard they reopened, I couldn't have been happier!Their lunch menu is solid. You don't pay more than $7 (not including tax) for really great food. Their menu has variety and you can't go wrong with anything. I'm a General Tso's combo fan that includes General Tso's chicken with pork fried rice and an egg roll, but on occasion I flip around through the menu.  Never disappointed. The only downside is they don't accept credit cards. Shame but that's not stopping me.  I mostly order out so delivery time is usually between 30-40min. If that's too long, learn to be patient.  Don't let the outside of this place deceive you.  Many say the phrase ""Hole in the Wall"" and consider it a bad thing. Sometimes those are the best places to eat and this is definitely in that category.Don't pass up the New Mr. Rice Kitchen. It's bang for your buck ^-^",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

I ordered for Delivery, and I got my food within a half hour on a Thursday night, which is pretty good. The Lo Mien was OK, I didn't care much for the sweetness of the sauce in a Beef Lo Mien. However the boneless spare ribs were spot on, I ate the entire container by myself in one sitting! My verdict here with be go with this place for delivery in the Heights, so far its the only place I haven't had intestinal problems with!",Mr Rice’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
