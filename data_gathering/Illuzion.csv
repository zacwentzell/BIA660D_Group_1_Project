1,Z6g-jEpKaZyVeQ4aCtmqGQ,Sage L.,1.0 star rating,"I use Yelp daily to look up restaurants but have never left a review, so you know this was bad.Read below for misleading prices, misleading serving sizes, and ATROCIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE, specifically from the manager. I was looking forward to trying Illuzion because the menu on their website featured some interesting special rolls at decent prices, ranging from $9 to $13.50. However everything was priced way more expensive when I got to the restaurant, especially the special rolls which were actually $17-$20 each. I was annoyed because this difference is pretty significant and I would've gone somewhere more affordable. I didn't want to spend that much on a single roll, so I went to the menu section of regular rolls and ordered one of the more elaborate ones off there for $11, along with an order of fried rice.When the roll came out, it only had 5 pieces. I'm not a stickler, but it was just so little food. I was already feeling misled/unhappy about the menu prices and feeling ripped off a second time before ever taking a bite. I asked the server if there should be another piece. ""No."" I said if the roll was smaller than the others I believe this should've been indicated, because this portion is extremely small for $11 and I wouldn't have ordered it. She said she would ask the manager. I waited awkwardly for 10 minutes (not eating the roll), but no one comes. The server came to refill our waters and again said ""just 5 pieces."" I asked if the manager (who the server said she would get btw--I never asked) is still coming.The manager then stormed over, asking ""You don't like the food?"" in an accusatory tone while reaching to grab my plate. I politely explained that it's not that I don't like it (I haven't even tasted it), just that I was surprised at how small the portion is for this price and that a 5-piece roll is not normal and should've been indicated on the menu. She yells at me that I should've know because every roll with shrimp or lobster is small everywhere (obviously not true). She kept grabbing for the plate saying she'll take it back if I don't want it. I stayed cool and collected, trying to explain how I feel again and telling her I was a dissatisfied customer and just thought she should know. But she kept interrupting me and rolling her eyes. And I had to seriously ask her to stop interrupting so I could finish my sentence more than once. The conversation was about 25% me talking and 75% her yelling, rolling her eyes, interrupting me, and grabbing for my plate. I eventually said i didn't want it, so she grabbed the plate, stormed off, and threw it over to the sushi bar. And then proceeded to huff and puff her way over to the servers and gossip about me. She didn't care even a drop that I was not happy.I have never been spoken to so rudely by anyone in a restaurant, let alone a manager.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We came here for dinner to cap our Memorial Day weekend road trip to Pennsylvania.It was late at night when we got here and since the weather was pleasant, we decided to sit outside the restaurant.The waitress introduced herself to us and handed us the menu almost immediately. There's wide variety of dishes to choose from the menu. From sushi rolls to hibachi, teriyaki and tapas. I selected the ""spicy rolls medley"" that consist of spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellow tail rolls served with miso soup and vegetable salad with ginger dressing.There's nothing particularly outstanding about the food, I certainly have eaten better rolls before but it was decent and they do have a solid customer service.I will certainly visit this place whenever I'm in Hoboken, especially now that I know that it's BYOB and they don't add corkage fee!",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Of course, I'm always ordering the same thing: Sashimi Lunch Special, so there's no cooking involved LOL. Still, I get more than enough fresh sashimi, plus miso soup and salad. It comes so fast that I don't have to worry about room-temperature fish. Their smoked edamame is also good, with an herbal taste of star anise and/or cloves. A nice switch from standard edamame.When dining at the restaurant, I like their bento box lunch specials. Last week I had their grilled miso black cod. It was cooked to perfection and very moist. Well worth the $13. Their saba bento box is good too.I'm still a bit put off by Illuzion charging $2.50 for green tea, but at least they may have read my old review and got rid of the tacky cut-up cardboard and now use little trivets or coasters for their teapots on the table ;-)",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

All were delicious and I'm pretty confidant we will both be making our way back! The ONLY thing I would mention is that if you're sitting people outside and it's getting late, you might want to warn them that the outdoor seating closes at a certain point.

A waiter came over and I hoped he would get her to take it off so I would go away. But nope. He said he was calling the police. I pointed out that having the police at your restaurant wasn't particularly good for business. She didn't care. I don't think they actually called the police. I stood my ground and finally they voided the first charge and charged me for my rolls and no tea.

Based on my experience with delivery through the service ""Seamless"" I would never give this restaurant my business ever again.  I will also continue to spread word of this horrible experience being the worst customer service interaction in my life.  On January 8 at 4:07 pm I placed a simple order of a Shrimp Tempura Roll & an order of Mixed Tempura.  My order was $13.50 and I chose to tip $2.50, now typically I prefer to tip in cash based on punctuality of the driver and experience with the drop off, I only had $2 cash on my so I was going to use my discretion whether I would tip more than what I had already charged on my credit card.  Fast forward an hour and my food still hadn't arrived.  If you have never used Seamless it's quite nifty, the service provides you with a time frame in which your food will arrive as well as an update of when your food order was accepted, prepared and left the restaurant. The time frame provided to me was 45-55 minutes...an hour and fifteen minutes later my food arrived, 20 minutes late. I opened the door and greeted the delivery driver and before he even handed me my food or greeted me back he looks at the order invoice and said to me, ""We have a problem, we need to talk about your order"" I thought I made a mistake or maybe they made a mistake and asked what the issue was. He then continued and stated, "" you only tipped me $2.50 and where you live you have to tip at least $5, you can't tip so low you have to tip me more."" At this point I was in complete shock that he would even have the courage to demand more money from me when he was late. I do not live far from the restaurant either, it's 1.2 miles from my home I didn't think this was an issue especially because the ONLY requirement while ordering was $10 minimum order, there was no tip minimum or delivery fee, nothing else. I asked him, "" well is there a minimum? Because I didn't see anything online"" his response was, "" No there's no minimum but $5 is a good tip and if you don't want to fine! You don't order from us anymore. Order somewhere else next time!"" The nerve of this delivery man...I was so confused and shocked. He just told me I can't order from them bc I didn't tip him 40% of my $14 meal! I took a couple deep breaths and decided to let it go, I wanted to enjoy my meal. I opened my meal and it was wrong!!! The roll I paid for was Shrimp Tempura the roll I got was a California roll. I ordered Mixed tempura which is supposed to come with shrimp and vegetables, I got Vegetable Tempura. To top it off my tempura was cold and soggy and my roll was falling apart, poorly assembled. I decided to call the restaurant and tried to speak to the manager. The first woman who answered asked me if she could help me with anything I said no I just wanted to speak to the manager and she was very persistent and kept asking me what was wrong.  At this point I felt like she knew I was upset and didn't want me to complain. After about four minutes of going back and forth about me wanting to speak to a manager I asked what the managers name was and she told me she didn't know and that she was new. I was in disbelief this was happening to me, then I asked to speak to someone else who was not new, she passed the phone to someone else but first filled her in on what was happening. The next employee I spoke to also wouldn't let me speak to the manager,  three minutes into going back and forth and trying to get the managers name she finally gave me the name Wendy, but that she was there.  I hung up very upset and feeling very swindled and all in all confused and like I wasted money and still hungry.  I decided to call the next day using the name she gave me, I asked for Wendy, the employee said she was not in I asked when she would be back the employee said she didn't know. I let a couple days go by and called back today, the same scenario happened, Wendy wasn't there and no one knew when she would get back. I am at a loss here.

And beautiful preparation.  We had miso soup, tempura, sashimi, and 2 rolls.  The sashimi are 3 pieces per order, and very large pieces, so my dear husband ordered wayyyyyy too much. Still in all, he was shocked that the bill came to only $75. I guess drinks add up!  There is a deli down the block, so we ordered, he had ran out and grabbed some great beers while they prepared our meal.  I LOVE sashimi that is nice and thick. Monster Sushi in NYC has this style, and I prefer it over small, thin slices.  Hmm, I am drooling thinking about it now.Service was very practical and cursive. We like to eat at the bar, and the waitresses were yelling orders right by my ear the whole night.  I would LOVE to return.  However.  Hoboken being Hoboken, this place was frackin loud- louder than a bar. There was a table of 6 cackling geese behind us.  You know the cackling geese.  There are large groups of these noisy 20-something geese all over Hoboken.  Listen.  Hint little girls.  There is a reason you are with a pack of GIRLS every weekend, and there is a reason there were no MEN at that table behind us.

And I was so impressed with the food that I returned to try one of their lunch specials the very next day! (I would've gone the following day as well, but I didn't want them to start recognizing me.)For dinner, I chose ""The Old Man and The Sea"" as my sushi roll, & I shared a side dish of Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura with one of my friends. The sushi was delicious! The shrimp tempura was huge, the rice was perfectly cooked, and the tuna was so flavorful. My only complaint is that I did not expect the ribbon of spicy sauce drizzled on top of my sushi roll. Thankfully, it wasn't too strong and actually added a pleasant bite to the fish. Dinner service was great - our server was very attentive & accommodated all of our requests (brown rice, extra sauce, etc).I caught a glimpse of the lunch menu & decided to try their Bento Box the next day. OMG - the portions are incredible. I ordered Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura to go, and it came with Miso soup, Salad, a few pieces of California Roll, a little egg roll, and white rice. It was so good ... I wish I could've finished it!I went back once more to have a lunch-sized Vegetable Tempura with Chicken Fried Rice ... so good. Again, the portions were so big that I couldn't finish it all. But the food is fantastic.Price-wise, the food is a bit more expensive than I'd like, but you definitely get what you pay for. I can't go there every day for lunch; but when I can, I know I'll be satisfied for the entire day. It's a great place for dinner with friends - or maybe a date? - but the restaurant is a bit small and I'd anticipate a wait on the weekends.

The good: Well, they have a good selection of choices.  From sushi, noodles, rice, and even some fusion items on the menu.  I had a ramen dish and others in my party had sushi rolls.  Everything looked good and tasted fine.The bad:The service is honestly not great, but I'm not local so maybe this is the norm for NJ? First when I asked the server what is the ""paitan broth"" in their ramen dish, he could not tell me.  He could not come up with any description.  Not one word. We sat there for at least 2 hours and he never once came to refill my water. Basically there was no ""service"" to be said.  However, I asked if I could charge my phone somewhere and the waitress nicely charged it for me at the front desk.So overall, it's average.  The ambiance is fine, the food is fine, and if you're in the area and want to bring your own wine to dinner, this seems like a good option.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They have a nice selection of rolls so you should have no problem finding something to order. They lost a star because there is almost always a weird smell inside when i go; a cleaning fluid smell like bleach or windex. Another star because their service is just okay.

Based on my experience with delivery through the service ""Seamless"" I would never give this restaurant my business ever again.  I will also continue to spread word of this horrible experience being the worst customer service interaction in my life.  On January 8 at 4:07 pm I placed a simple order of a Shrimp Tempura Roll & an order of Mixed Tempura.  My order was $13.50 and I chose to tip $2.50, now typically I prefer to tip in cash based on punctuality of the driver and experience with the drop off, I only had $2 cash on my so I was going to use my discretion whether I would tip more than what I had already charged on my credit card.  Fast forward an hour and my food still hadn't arrived.  If you have never used Seamless it's quite nifty, the service provides you with a time frame in which your food will arrive as well as an update of when your food order was accepted, prepared and left the restaurant. The time frame provided to me was 45-55 minutes...an hour and fifteen minutes later my food arrived, 20 minutes late. I opened the door and greeted the delivery driver and before he even handed me my food or greeted me back he looks at the order invoice and said to me, ""We have a problem, we need to talk about your order"" I thought I made a mistake or maybe they made a mistake and asked what the issue was. He then continued and stated, "" you only tipped me $2.50 and where you live you have to tip at least $5, you can't tip so low you have to tip me more."" At this point I was in complete shock that he would even have the courage to demand more money from me when he was late. I do not live far from the restaurant either, it's 1.2 miles from my home I didn't think this was an issue especially because the ONLY requirement while ordering was $10 minimum order, there was no tip minimum or delivery fee, nothing else. I asked him, "" well is there a minimum? Because I didn't see anything online"" his response was, "" No there's no minimum but $5 is a good tip and if you don't want to fine! You don't order from us anymore. Order somewhere else next time!"" The nerve of this delivery man...I was so confused and shocked. He just told me I can't order from them bc I didn't tip him 40% of my $14 meal! I took a couple deep breaths and decided to let it go, I wanted to enjoy my meal. I opened my meal and it was wrong!!! The roll I paid for was Shrimp Tempura the roll I got was a California roll. I ordered Mixed tempura which is supposed to come with shrimp and vegetables, I got Vegetable Tempura. To top it off my tempura was cold and soggy and my roll was falling apart, poorly assembled. I decided to call the restaurant and tried to speak to the manager. The first woman who answered asked me if she could help me with anything I said no I just wanted to speak to the manager and she was very persistent and kept asking me what was wrong.  At this point I felt like she knew I was upset and didn't want me to complain. After about four minutes of going back and forth about me wanting to speak to a manager I asked what the managers name was and she told me she didn't know and that she was new. I was in disbelief this was happening to me, then I asked to speak to someone else who was not new, she passed the phone to someone else but first filled her in on what was happening. The next employee I spoke to also wouldn't let me speak to the manager,  three minutes into going back and forth and trying to get the managers name she finally gave me the name Wendy, but that she was there.  I hung up very upset and feeling very swindled and all in all confused and like I wasted money and still hungry.  I decided to call the next day using the name she gave me, I asked for Wendy, the employee said she was not in I asked when she would be back the employee said she didn't know. I let a couple days go by and called back today, the same scenario happened, Wendy wasn't there and no one knew when she would get back. I am at a loss here.

I can tell you the manager runs this place like a factory. She knew it was cold outside and she could have given us seating upstairs where there is more space and the place was literally empty. She made us sit downstairs in a very small and uncomfortable spot and places a small heater besides us. They don't show new customers proper seating.

After looking at a bunch of places up on Yelp I decided to give Illuzion a try.The first time I tried it, I got it to go. I ordered my usual, being miso soup, sweet potato roll, salmon avocado roll and a side of spicy mayo. Price wise, it comes out to be about the same as the other place I used to frequent which is more than reasonable. What I noticed about this place while picking up my order was the environment. There was music but it was definitely not loud,  you could easily hold a conversation without having to yell. The place is dimly lit and isn't very large. The first thought that came to my mind is that this could be a great date spot. As for the food itself, I have to say that I noticed right away how fresh and flavorful the fish was. I got the same roll from here multiple times afterwards and it has been consistently good. As for the sweet potato roll, I have to say that it was somewhat disappointing. It definitely was not bad but I had better. The miso soup was good but I could not distinguish it from any other miso soup that I previously had. I came to the restaurant twice to eat in. The first time was really good and I was impressed with the service. The second time was for my birthday and I was with a group. Our orders took a very long time to come and for some reason came later than some other tables that ordered after us. Since it was a happy occasion and I was surrounded by friends, I didn't notice it as much, but if it was just an ordinary night I would have been quite annoyed.There is a place for improvement in terms of the sweet potato roll and the service yet this has become my favorite Sushi place in Hoboken.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The California Spicy is also great for non-fish lovers. If you are looking for hot dishes go for the Shrimp Teriyaky or Lemongrass Scallop & Shrimp, they are great!

Tasted quite fresh and worth the money. About 10 bucks for the Toro and 6 for the Uni. The rest of the meal is where it all went downhill..We ordered the El Bulli Roll and the Fallen Angel..both very dry and you could tell was def not fresh. Some points of my Fallen Angel roll just came off the rice, that's how dry the rice was I guess. The Miso Soup was OK. Entire time after the meal my stomach was making weird noises and felt odd..

Also, I'll give them bonus points for offering brown rice substitution for no extra charge. I have to say that the special rolls were a tad on the expensive side.. but the fact that it was BYOB made up for that in how much we would have spent.

It took about 15 minutes for a waitress to come over to our table and bring us waters, and another 15 minutes for her to even ask us if we wanted to appetizers. She could barely speak english, and when I asked for two of the rolls for my entree, she had to have another waitress come over because she couldn't understand me. She ended up getting the entire order wrong, and brought out all of our entrees (4 of us in total) about 20 minutes apart from each other. The appetizers were good, but no utensils were provided until after the fact. The sushi was probably the worst sushi I ever had. The rolls were extremely small and tasteless, and the rice fell off the rolls upon picking up the sushi with chopsticks. Also, the couple sitting next to us had both of their entrees messed up and look just as annoyed.

I've been here for dinner with large groups several times as well.  The food is just as good in the evening.  I've had a handful of sushi entrees including the charashi (a mix of sashimi on a bed of rice), an assortment of special rolls, sushi and sashimi.  All of these have been consistently good.  I've also had a lot of their appetizers, one that stood out to me is the octopus appetizer and I would highly recommend it to all who go to Illuzion.  Kitchen entrees are pretty good as well but I have to be honest that sushi has a place in my heart so I usually stick to the fish. Service at Illuzion has always been pretty good.  It's nothing special but your water glass is always full and they your empty plates won't be in front of you on your table for long when you are done eating.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The regular rolls are nothing special, but again, that's regular rolls. The speciality rolls are good, but the sashimi is fantastic. It is the freshest sashimi I have purchased out of all the sushi places I have dined at. The stir fry udon entry is also very flavorful and has a generous amount of seafood for only 12.50.Once you  go to Illuzion, it will be hard to find fresher and better cut sashimi elsewhere in Hoboken and the surrounding areas.

The service and delivery guys are super friendly and accommodating. Sometimes they throw in free mochis (we're good customers). However, the house salads and miso soups lately had declined severely in quality. A wad of ice berg lettuce, one grape tomato, that's it.

Naturally, we walked in for dinner since they were open.Sushi was still good and creative, though I stuck with the basics - spicy scallop, spicy california, white tuna cucumber - the special rolls were a little too overwhelming this time around. All were great, though I think the white tuna would be great with some scallion sprinkled in.My parents and sister shared some non-sushi dishes that were also tasty. The table favorite: Miso Glazed Black Cod. Slightly sweet and smokey, served over sticky black rice.Lemongrass Shrimp and Scallops was lacking a bit in the flavor department - expected a little more oomph with the description.

We're really not sure what it was, and it eventually was mentioned it was on the house, but really I think the sushi chefs were just hot for my friend. I don't blame them -- she's cute.The sushi was expensive for what it was (I'm used to Brooklyn prices, so sue me) but the fish wasn't very good, the rice didn't stay together, the rolls weren't flavorful, the soy sauce tasted odd and their spicy mayo (what goes in the spicy rolls) was way too tangy.In addition, at least two waitresses stopped by to ask my friend what her Kanji symbol on her back meant.It's not a terrible place, but considering all the other sushi options in the area, it seems as there should be better choices.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Would never have waited that long if we knew. Don't even bother making a reservation here as they don't write anything down.When our table FINALLY was ready, no one walked us to the table, no apologies for the wait, the guy at the front simply waved his hand and shooed us to the back to our table, incredibly rude.To top it off, the waitress was surly and it took us asking 3 times and finally asking a separate waitress to get water.The only good thing was that our food came out quickly since we were starving from the wait.

259,xMNbh4gKsycoGc1Vm8omzA,Jonathan F.,5.0 star rating,"Although I constantly find myself wasting hours on Yelp, [prior to this instance] only once had I taken the time to actually write out a review.Way too often it seems like Yelpers forget the purpose of writing reviews.... As an individual who owns their own business, I see Yelp as an informative tool for the consumer AND an 'opportunity' for the business-entity.  Critique properly as a Yelp review can make-or-break a business.  Someone recently wrote that they enjoyed their food, but they were upset because they were charged $2 extra for a substitution, and then had the nerve to rate this restaurant ONE STAR.  I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.  You even said yourself that you would have rated this place three-or-four stars, but rather than being rational, you decided to be a moron and give this place ONE star based on the contingency that you're cheap.[/end rant]My thoughts on Illuzion... There are only a handful of places in Hoboken that consistently provide both great food and great service: Illuzion is one of those places.  I've tried every sushi place in Hoboken, as well as countless amounts of places around Manhattan.  In Hoboken, it is easily the best.  The fish always tastes of the freshest quality.  The rolls are beautiful pieces of art; they are unique, they are large, and they are delicious.  If they don't have a specific roll you are looking for, they will cater to your needs and try to create it as best as possible - if it's not what you were hoping for... THEY TAKE IT BACK with no complaints.  The interior is as tastefully done as it gets in Hoboken:  It is young, modern, and they're often displaying new art.  There is no techno music blaring like some of the other places in Hoboken.   You don't have to beg for air conditioning in the summer or heat in the winter like those other places as well.  They hang your coat as you walk in.  The staff there is incredible.  They are personable.  They help you with the menus and constantly give you recommendations.  They make sure you're comfortable and happy throughout the meal.  They make sure your glass is full with water, and your other beverages [sake] are served correctly as well.  When you're finished, they don't rush you to pay the check or leave - even if you're there after close.  Most importantly it is ALWAYS the same staff.  This place has ZERO turn-over!  You know them, they know you.Pricing is more than reasonable.  THIS IS SUSHI PEOPLE.  It is not meant to be cheap.  Not quite sure if people are familiar with the process of purchasing seafood on the wholesale level:  EVERYTHING IS MARKET PRICE.  This means that there is no set price for that piece of tuna you're eating.  One day they may pay $7.99/lb and the next day they could be paying $9.99/lb.  Add in the fact that there is a bidding war for the fish as it comes to the market.  Places like MASA [which is a set minimum of $400 per person, and you don't even get to choose what you will be eating] have the best quality sushi in the United States based off the fact that they have more capital to bid with, and will ALWAYS get first pick of fish. If a sushi restaurant is cheap, they are likely working with 'yesterdays' delivery or buying from a discounted fish wholesaler.  Special rolls at Illuzion typically range from $10-$14, but they're large rolls - and absolutely delicious.  I will argue with anyone that this is the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken - and to be quite honest I happen to think it's better than Manhattan's Nobu or SushiSamba [which both are far pricier].If you are looking to eat great sushi in a great atmosphere, there is no better place than Illuzion in Hoboken.  I highly recommend it, and think most will enjoy it.  My go-to rolls are the Nowhere Boy, Fallen Angel, and Blue Heaven.  Their unagi is delicious, as is their calamari appetizer.  Can't go wrong with anything here.-Jonathan",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

331,55IUSOQ1YmDXMbLlitx-uw,Theresa R.,2.0 star rating,"We ordered delivery and the food was good, but not a very big quantity as compared to the price.  More importantly, we ordered per their website in which they charged us $5 more total and the delivery guy looked at my boyfriend because he wanted more tip, $4 wasn't enough apparently, so he gave him another $1.  So after that is when I looked at the receipt and discovered the overcharge.  They told me that no one orders from their website and that I had to come pick up my $5 after I insisted they owe me money, because they of course at first we're not going to return it.  They actually did return the money and I laughed when the delivery man handed over a menu with it.  I gave it back and told him based on the overcharge I would never order again from there.  This company needs to either take down their website or change their pricing on it.  It is a shame that companies act like this.  I received no apology, but instead a huge attitude.  This is precisely how you lose business people!",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The special rolls were delicious yet slightly pricy for the size. The service was far from great, but not worth passing the opportunity to try the food. I will be going there again and hopefully the service will be a little faster this time. The decor and setting are super chic and funky, good atmosphere.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We are very into old school/traditional sushi so I can't really comment on the special rolls, nonetheless the fish are fresh and taste good, and lets face it, that is all we really need... The kitchen dishes were also a pleasant surprise",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I tend to not have sushi delivered because I find you are given a lesser quality, but this is not true of Illuzion, who also has a lightening speed delivery service.",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
336,jDjUmEGrz9KFDPXBV2encw,David S.,5.0 star rating,Best sushi restaurant in Hoboken. The sushi is fantastic quality and they have an excellent menu with a lot unique specialty rolls (my favorite is the Fallen Angel). I always get the sushi when I go but my friends who don't like sushi say that the regular dishes are very good as well. This place also has a great atmosphere and a very cool design for people that care about that sort of thing.,Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

339,uoyxvqOginqHiDxIQ5-lpQ,Lisa H.,4.0 star rating,"This is my favorite sushi in Hoboken. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is bc I have had better sushi in NYC and in Vegas. What I really like about Iluzion is: A) Not too much rice on the rolls, even the inside out versions. I think the other sushi places in town go overboard on the rice. I like that Illuzion uses more fish and filling than rice. B) The special rolls are amazing and still fit in your mouth. Nothing annoys me more than splurging $10-$15 for a special roll and not being able to taste it bc you can't fit it into your mouth and when you do you can't breathe and are trying to just get it down. The special rolls here are amazing, creative and although a bit larger than a regular roll, not too large to enjoy! C) Delivery is ROCKET fast! D) They understand little changes to your order and get them right. I don't like avacado so some rolls I order I order without avacado or add cucumber, and they always nail it. D) BYOB! Its my favorite in the summertime bc my friends and I can sit outside along 4th street and just chill and drink wine or beers and they are so accomodating. They don't rush you at all and we have sat there for 2 hours sometimes, ordering as we go, and they are great! They never get annoyed if we order 10 times over 2 hours and are just wonderful. E) The appetizers are awesome! I love the smoked edemame and have never seen this anywhere else! The rock shrimp and soft shell crab appis are also amazing!",Illuzion,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
