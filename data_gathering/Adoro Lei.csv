5,EWTopznK9B-x9A9yTDbyxA,Peter C.,2.0 star rating,"I always start to doubt myself when I have a bad experience at somewhere so highly rated, but honestly I cannot see what all the fuss is about and I left here feeling really disappointed.One thing I will say is that the service is very fast and efficient...almost too fast and efficient. Within 5 minutes of arriving, we had already been served and were tucking into our appetizers. While I shouldn't hold this against them, it makes me a little suspicious how they were able to take our appetizer order and get it out to us so fast... that being said, the waiting staff were attentive, and really I cannot fault them.The food however left much to be desired. The only words I can use are bland and tasteless, and that pretty much covers the whole repertoire of our order.We had the following:-Calamari - very standard as far as taste goes. It was the kind of dish you'd get at a beach bar for a snack and sustenance as oppose to look forward to as part of an evening meal. Fairly flavorless and unseasoned, and also lacking texture.Rice balls - probably the best dish of the meal, but still nothing to write home about. Soft and gooey, and exuding strong aroma of truffle when broken open; they're served with a marinara sauce that's slightly on the watery side. Again, bar food in standard.Simonetta pizza - supposedly topped with mushrooms and goats cheese, but lacking any flavour that would indicate the two. The only flavour I could genuinely taste was the black pepper I cracked on top of it. Special shout out to the dough and crust however, as the texture and bite really was great.Little Queens Pasta - this literally tasted like something you'd whizz together as a quick dinner after the gym. With pasta, broccoli rabe and sausage meats as the base the of the dish, that's literally what it tasted like. The bare bones of the three. No seasoning or extras to bind it or bring it together. The dish was oily and severely lacking flavor.Crispy sprouts - despite being served on a sizzle plate, there was nothing crispy about them. They were actually boiled, instead of roasted, so immediately they lacked any of that crisp texture. Again, nothing binder the dish together. It was just boiled sprouts, bacon and a handful of cranberries.Pains me to say it based on other reviews, but this place really was disappointing in my eyes. Only saving grace to give it 2 stars was the way the waiting staff carried them self.Avoid.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

The truffle riceballs were my absolute favorite and I could probably eat those all day forever. But the mini calzones and the sliders were also delicious! For pizza, we went with one of their specials which included mozzarella cheese, broccoli rabe and sausage...simple, but so good, with a nice thin crust. And we also tried a few of the pastas. They offer two sizes for the pastas, so we all went with the smaller portions which was perfect after all those appetizers. I loved the Lover's Purses, and can't wait to go back and try the Roses are Red pasta. I think Adoro Lei is my new near-work lunch spot!",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

I was surprised to see the good reviews on yelp compared to what I actually experienced. The service was great, hence, deserving of the 3 stars, however, the food was quite average. Other than the truffle arancini, I didn't find any of the food to be spectacular. We had a variety of appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and meat dishes, but the taste was nothing great. The burratta cheese in the appetizer had a strange aftertaste and the calamari was far from crispy fried perfection. The food wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't anything special. The cocktails were pretty good and our server was quick to bring us our drinks or attend to us for whatever we needed, which was a positive. I would say the service made the experience, but I don't think this is a place I will be coming back to anytime soon.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

My fiancÃ© and I ordered the sausage and pepper bites, the fried rice balls, the sliders and lasagna. The sausage and pepper bites as well as the lasagna needed some more meat to it. They were also lacking salt. I did enjoy the fried rice balls because it was a perfect balance. But overall I don't know if I would go back. Like I said before above average Italian food. The Decor and space was very nice. However I do not understand why the staff are wearing those T-shirts it does not go with the Decor at all. Also my server was not very attentive it may have been because we went in around 5 PM which is the slow Time but she was standing around talking to the other staff.

46,1871c3VJYWX3ogK5OgOCcA,Wendy L.,4.0 star rating,"Not only is the pizza good, the apps are worth ordering as well. I've always found pizza shops to be slacking on the app frontier, but the the veal and pork meatballs and truffle rice balls were screaming to be ordered, so my friend and I opted to order these two apps, along with the white pesto pie topped with soppresseta. For the meatballs, you're able to choose for 3 sliders or 5 meatballs without the buns (which is what we did). I would recommend you do the same because why wouldn't you want two extra meatballs for the same $14 cost?! The meatballs were so moist and delicious. I loved that it also came with arugula for when you wanted a palate cleanser. The key to the dish was the tomato sauce though - I wish there was more of it (although there was plenty, but clearly not enough!) because I used the tomato sauce as the dipping sauce to the truffle rice balls. If you're a truffle lover, you'll love the rice balls because you can really taste the truffle with each bite. The dish was a generous portion too as it came with 7 rice balls! Tip - check in for the free lil lover's pie! It's 5 small slices that's also another great app to share as you can only redeem one per table. My friend and I knew we were in for a good pie once we took a bite of the lil lover's pie as the dough was perfectly charred and had a nice chewy texture. If you order the meatballs, dip the crust into the tomato sauce - so yum! By the time we finished our 3 apps, we were kind of full. However that thought erased our minds when our pizza arrived. We devoured our pie! If there was one compliant, it would be that I wished there was more soppresseta on the pie. I'm a sucker for soppresseta.

Regardless of where you eat, the food and service are exceptional. I've had the Calamari Fritti which is amazing. Fresh calamari, tasty and cooked perfectly. Literally could not be any better. I've also had the Penne Vodka Superiore, which is also delicious. The vodka sauce is clearly made in house as it has its own unique taste which makes the dish excellent.Also, and surprisingly, I have speak on the bread that is served prior to the meal. This is no ordinary table bread, this bread tastes exactly like pizza crust. If you closed you're eyes and ate it, you would think someone ripped it off a slice and fed it to you. And not dominos either, high quality crust. Basically, this bread is delicious.This place has won me over and I've been here numerous times since I first came a few months ago. Food is excellent, service is great, decor is modern and they have outside seating. Can't go wrong here. I also hear they have a DJ on Thursdays for happy hour, but haven't experienced that yet.

But as someone who lives within walking distance of Roberta's and has had many a good slice in her day, trust me on this one.We went for lunch, and had two of their more basic pies: the Rosina (a margherita with fresh mozzarella) and the Casanova (a margherita with buffalo mozzarella). Two very simple pies, with tomato, fresh cheese, and very little else.Only, the flavors on both of these were incredible. The two tomato sauces were complex and sweet; you could definitely tell the difference between the two despite the similarity in toppings. I liked the creamy buffalo mozzarella the best, but both really were excellent.And the crust? Hands down the best I've had. Really thin and perfectly charred, with chewy delicious crusts. I usually don't eat crusts in their entirety, but I devoured Adoro Lei's; it was perfect for dipping in olive oil at the end.I would probably recommend ordering one pie per person, as they're slightly larger than a personal sized pie.

For this alone I would give 5 stars, but it just kept getting better! The vibe of the staff is approachable and friendly to guests which is icing on the cake. Their staff was inundated with coat check due to the frigid NYC weather, but they gave service with a smile. I overheard many times throughout the 3 hours of the event that the food was amazing! Guests enjoyed the delicious selection of food and dessert displayed around the restaurant.

Â Service was very friendly and attentive on my two visits as well. Â Before I mention the food, I do want to say that Adoro Lei is a great addition to the Hudson Square area which is lacking in sit down restaurants. Â It's not a far walk to Carmine Street or Spring street, but it's nice to have a closer option, aside from Westville (which is always mobbed for lunch) and The Ear (which has horrible acoustics).*On to the food, I was impressed with the numerous and delicious sounding pizzas on the menu, there must be at least 10 choices, ranging from the low to high teens in price. Â On my last visit I split the Isabella pie ($17 -tomato, artichoke, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, pecorino, mozzarella) and a Chianti Kale Salad ($10 - Kale, spinach, shiitake mushroom, ricotta salata, chianti sesame dressing) and found the portion size to be a little too small to share 1 pie and a salad; I would recommend each person order their own salad and share a pie. Â I liked the sauce, crust, and brick oven char on the pizza, but I was a little under whelmed by the toppings and will try another pie next visit. Â I should also mention they have a great lunch special, $10 for the margarita pie and a side salad.Also there is happy hour during the week from 4-7 with a lovely sounding drink menu.3.5 stars for food, 4 stars for dÃ©cor and service, and 5 stars for naming the panini's on the lunch menu after Led Zeppelin songs.*I should note I haven't yet tried Union Bar & Kitchen, and City Winery does a nice lunch as well.

Came here with a big group last night for my best friend's 24th birthday and we were in heaven. The food is just out of this world. All the recipes are old school Italian with a modern twist. The ingredients were fresh, top-notch, and the dishes were unique and extremely delicious. When you come here, you MUST try the burata, the lovers purses, and truffle rice balls...just out of this world. I don't know what secret ingredients are used at this place, but whatever they're doing makes the food here better than anywhere else. Drinks were also fantastic. Great cocktails and giant tequila punch bowl(great for birthday parties). Really interesting concoctions that left me wanting to come back and try everything else on the drink menu. Overall, Adoro Lei is my new favorite restaurant. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Rick, who was just such a great guy with a lot of heart(great style, too!) Rick and the rest of the staff make this place fun, friendly, and are always there to make sure you have everything you need. I recommend Adoro Lei to anyone who is passionate about food and Italian cuisine and wants to be blown away.

Â Staff were welcoming and happily applied the discounts we had with the Hooch app (free drinks) and Yelp check in offer (free lil' lover pie). Â I tried the all night affair which had a distinct pear flavor, was not too sweet and went down smoothly. Â Found the pear salad that included crispy bacon amongst the greens to be satisfying. Â Although after taking one bite of the truffle rice balls we forgot all about the salad. Â The truffle was at just the right strength so you tasted the other components of the rice ball as well as the truffle. Â Rice was at the right consistency since the rice ball stayed together as you took a bite. Â Mussels were fresh and the broth was light and flavorful. Â Lil' lover pie (basically a margarita pizza) was also delicious with hearty crust and mild sauce. Â They have a private room downstairs that looks good for a group of ~20.

Inside has a very open feel, you can even see the wood-fire oven they use for the pizzas.Extensive (and expensive) menu, with all sorts of pizza to choose from.

Panini was okay, but I had to add hot sauce and olive oil to bring out the flavor. Okay selection of light beers to go with the meal, ended up with a standard pilsener ($8).

Perhaps if I had gotten one of the stranger pies with golden raisins or speck I would have a stronger opinion, but my drunk self just wanted spicy meat and cheese.

I've been here three times (twice for sit-in service and once for take-out) and each time have had a fabulous experience. In two of the instances, the chef custom prepared a pizza for us that had been taken off the menu (it's delicious - smoked ricotta, mushrooms and raisins - trust me!) without any resistance. As a vegetarian, I've found the menu to be loaded with many viable options, including lots of pizza choices and some wonderful veggie sides that I've found work wonderfully as starter dishes. (The cauliflower is off-the-charts good). As for the staff, the servers and bartenders are all very welcoming, warm and affable. Even the neighbors next door (who we randomly started talking to as we were dining outside and they were walking in to their building) speak very fondly about the way the restaurant is managed.Coming from someone who has become disillusioned by many restaurants in New York City - or finds them simply not worth the cost - this one is a diamond in the rough.

Aside from the large office party, I don't think there were too many other guests, so seating wasn't an issue (we had reservations anyway). The space is pretty cool and has the modernist-pub feel to it: dim lighting, dark wood, abstract-ish paintings, etc. Loved the vibe of the place.We started off with a couple drinks. I ordered The Professional, which I expected to be sweeter, but had a strong, smoky flavor. My gf ordered the Silent Assassin Punch which was super delicious, so we traded since she likes bourbon-y drinks more anyway. For apps, we shared the sliders, roasted peppers, truffle rice balls, and burrata. The sliders, while they looked pretty average, were juicy and full of flavor and would highly recommend it. The roasted peppers, while tasty, just wasn't the right thing for me. Truffle rice balls were fried nicely and had the truffle taste carry the dish. The burrata was soft and laid on top of mushroom or eggplant (sorry, I forgot which) and was an excellent choice. I also heard that their Lover's Purse is an excellent choice, but we did not order that one.For the main dishes, we shared 3 pizzas (a random guy walked by our table and commented that we had too many pizzas for the number of people eating. False. You can never have too much pizza). Chris, the manager, commented that their margarita pizzas were pretty popular and I commented why would people choose a pizza with no toppings when there are so many topping-filled options on the menu? Then I took a bite of the Casanova and was blown away by the taste of simplicity. The Buffalo Mozzarella was fantastic! The soft, creaminess of it all was ridiculously good and was by far my favorite of the night. The second pizza was the Medici Magnificent, which had sliced salami-like meat, roasted peppers, and pesto. It was a good salty contrast to the cheesy Casanova. The last was the intriguing Tulia, which was Sambuca-cooked sausage and mussels. It had the sweetness from the Sambuca and saltiness from the mussels, creating an interesting flavor. I liked it, but our table (as well as the owner Michael) agreed that it might not be a pizza for everyone.For dessert we had Nutella covered churros (I forget the actual name of the dish), which is utterly amazing and mind-blowing. The dish was drenched in chocolate hazelnut goodness and smack in the middle was a plop of crÃ¨me fraiche. OMG, this meal was one for the books. I loved hearing from the owner about how he and his high school buddy chef got started; it was just a cool success story. Also, did you know he DJs at his own restaurant?

129,9tBjFgwbvd50npKmmgEleA,Chloe C.,5.0 star rating,"This review is long overdue. I had my first experience at Adoro Lei back in March. I met up with a few friends after work for some drinks and snacks. I love everything about this place from the ambiance, to the great service and certainly appreciate even the spacious, beautiful bathrooms in the basement! Intimate kind of setting, but with a very chic lounge feel. There's a long bar and a decent number of tables with leather seats in the booths--comfortable and sexy. Candlelight at night and the dimmers lowered, this is a great place for a dinner date or a group dining experience. Definitely don't roll up in your sweatpants because you might feel a bit out of place. Everything I've had the chance to try here has been executed perfectly in both presentation and taste. I do mean EVERY SINGLE THING. Both of my Adoro Lei dinners were with small groups so we ordered a variety of items which made it possible for me to sample so many of the wonderful things here! Things I've tried and loved (more to come on my third and fourth, etc. visits):1. The Love Board--divine charcuterie board with prosciutto, dry figs, honey crostini, olives and pecans, plus parmigiano! delicious and great for sharing with 2-5 people depending on what else you order ($18)2. Calamari Fritti--lightly fried to a perfect, golden crisp and served with grilled lemon and topped with all sorts of other fried goodies! namely zucchini, pear (interesting and tasty), and carrot. Different than your typical serving of squid.3. Little Queens Pasta--sausage, broccoli rabe, rotini pasta (if I remember correctly) and yass, girl, GARLIC!!! in a white wine sauce. I'm not typically a sausage lover, but this was flavorful and not too aggressive, except on the garlic, which makes me a happy camper.4. Tullia Pizza--white sauce, mussels, fresh mozzarella, ground sausage (I was with a couple sausage lovers). Neapolitan dough, obviously. I love a crustacean and the mussels were a nice touch to this pizza and went really well with the sausage, much to my surprise. OK, maybe sausage is growing on me the way bacon did after a quarter century on earth. I'm converted.Second Visit--add another Love Board and change up the diners, switch those cocktails to many bottles of red wine, and we're off:5. All My Love Panini--Prosciutto, arugula, tomato, burrata on their house bread. Super thin crust, which I love and it was a light, perfect panini bread. I'll take burrata anytime it's available, so this was a definite choice for sharing.6. In The Light Panini-- grilled chicken, mixed greens, dressing, tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella. If you needed something a bit more filling, but still not heavy, this is it. I'm pretty impressed with everything here, if you hadn't already noticed. It's kind of annoying (to me) to make my way down here, but I like to travel for a good meal and great service. Not to mention, this is a really amazing space.

Starving, we were last minute scrambling to find a italian dinner place in the area on Yelp. Most of the places we called up were fully booked or had long waits, but this place had room and good ratings, so off we went. The pizza was good, but the marinara pasta felt a little plain and uninspiring.. Boiled way past 'al dente'.. Also had a $10 side of cauliflower which was ok. All in all a little pricey for what you get in my opinion, considering that there's tons of great and inexpensive pizza places in the area. And by how this restaurant was labeled on Yelp as being an 'italian' restaurant, we were hoping for some good options for pasta etc. Since the menu on their Yelp site is incomplete, we were surprised to see they only had 3 pasta dishes on the menu.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"
132,RDfIVVN3jL2ISqyddBwvxw,Isabella K.,3.0 star rating,"I came here on a Thursday night for dinner, maybe around 8pm or so. What I didn't know is that the place easily doubles as a club/dance bar later at night. There was a dj in the center of the restaurant playing mostly top 40 hip hop and dance hits. I wouldn't complain so much about the music itself, rather the volume. I went there on a dinner date and it was nearly impossible to have an in depth conversation (so if you're simply aiming for a few drinks out with someone, this is the place for you).In terms of food, we ordered the prosecco mussels and the little queens pasta. The mussels were pretty good. They came in a tomato sauce that had some spice to it and a decent sized portion. The pasta, on the other hand, was terrible. Extremely bland. The menu said there should have been olive oil in the pasta, but it tasted plain and dry. I could've easily mistaken it for a bowl of pasta cooked by a teenage college student.The service was pretty good. I can't remember the name of our waiter, but he was pretty attentive and refilled our waters constantly. He brought us small tassels of Limoncello with our check, which was a nice added touch. The food also came out in under 10 minutes, which was crazy. I think this place would be a better place to go for drinks, dancing and maybe pizza, but if you're looking for a high quality sit-down meal, don't bother.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

The art on the wall is unique and nice to examine. The music was really good and they played movie clips on the TVs which led to some interesting conversation about the films. We were greeted by the host who was very friendly and sat us down in a nice booth. The waitress was also very friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. We ordered two pizzas (one to take home). The Giuliano (Octopus, tomato and fingerling potatoes) was good (I do like the way they cooked their pizza) but not as good as I'd expect. The Isabella (Tomato, Artichoke Hearts, Mushrooms) was much better. We both enjoyed that one. As I said I thought the pizza was cooked well except for the center which got a little thin and soggy. Other than that the pizza was very good. They had a nice drink menu including some nice draft beers but I also decided to try the Honey Halluncinates (Rye, Honey Syrup, Peryshauds, Absinthe). It was awesome. I'm not much of a cocktail person and frankly I rarely order a cocktail, but this was really good. The menu looked great and I would love to try some of their other offerings.

151,B2cXoY9uC5YPmV2-_AuFSg,Tim S.,2.0 star rating,"Last Friday evening, I was looking for a new place to try pizza in my neighborhood. I decided on this restaurant as I had never been. Upon arrival with a reservation, the very nice hostess attempted to seat me at a bar table near the front door. This option was unacceptable to me and I requested a table in the main dining room. The hostess informed me that one was not available and that it would be a 25 minute wait for another table. As my guest and I turned to leave, a table miraculously became available in the main dining room. Surprise, surprise. I really hate when restaurants play games with their seating. In terms of the food, we shared a plate of the calamari, which was simply OK, but not great. We also split one of the pizzas which again was not bad, but not memorable either. Â The bottle of red with the meal was acceptable. Â In terms of the service, the timing was a tad off. Since the overall experience was marginal at best, I left a little bit under 15% as my tip. The main reason that I am writing this review is that either the server or the manager added extra tip to my bill, bringing the total tip to 20%. I discovered this when I checked my AMEX statement online today. I immediately telephoned AMEX and was provided with a credit for the overcharge.In all honesty, the amount of additional overcharge was not significant. However, it is the principle. There is no way that this was an accident. I am writing this review to warn other patrons to be careful when dining at this restaurant.

Heard no complaints around the table and everyone was grabbing different slices to have a taste of something someone else ordered. It took awhile for one of my coworkers to get her pizza and seemed as if they forgot to put in her order. In the end we ended up packing up the remaining slices together and it was a great treat for later!

Â We moved to a table and started with truffled rice balls, (arrancini),moist with fresh, runny mozzarella inside... ""My, my, another dozen or two, please?"" (Seven of them to an order). The burrata was so fresh and fabulous, it could have been lunch with a nice bagette. Â Now with heightened expectations, a group of us split an amazingly light pizza with wild mushrooms, charred a bit in the wood burning stove. (How they keep this place so cool with a wood-burning stove going full blast is one of those little technical mysteries I try not to think about for too long.) Â The beet salad and citrus pear salad were perfect on this infernalday. Lightly dressed, crisp arugula, dotted with giant, fresh blackberries and lightly roasted beets, felt welcoming when it would have been easy to overwhelm us with globs of heavy ingredients. I very much appreciated the understated simplicity of this place. Â It knew where to draw the line, carefully avoiding the inclination towards becoming the typical Sohotrattoria, ostentatious, with outrageous prices, and a snooty 'tude. Â Service was excellent. Â We had asked to be set up at a large table, and without the slightestproblem were told that if the first one was not acceptable, they would set us up in anotherarea. This was done quietly, politely and without any fanfare. So refreshing for this part of town.The pasta dishes, with the choice of small or large portions, Â were fantastic, especially the little love purses, $12-$14/$18-$22 being the range of pasta prices. Dessert was really lovely...a light, red berry crostata,(""frutti di bosco""), covering a modest custard layer, typical ofRoman bakeries was delectable, along with a standard tartufo, and Â fried ""hazlenut fingers"" around a mound ofwhipped cream, which didn't even need to be there. These were other-worldy, especially when you've been off fried food for a while. Would go back here soon. Comfortable, relaxed, no disappointments.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"
178,gLuAL2GcBbJJlrjkuySiNQ,Mindy L.,5.0 star rating,"I first heard about Adoro Lei from an am NY article about best restaurants for large groups, and it wound up being the perfect venue for my friend's bachelorette party last night. It is so hard in NYC to find a restaurant that can accommodate a large group (about 20) and does not require a prix fixe menu. Adoro Lei let us reserve two large tables at the back left of the restaurant and order off the regular menu. The food and drinks (we loved the peach sangria bowls!) were perfect for sharing and the prices were extremely reasonable for a large group. We had space to move around, and the space was festive, but quiet enough that we could all catch up. The staff was flexible and accommodating. Everyone enjoyed their food, and the menu was great for special dietary needs (many vegetarians, gluten free, dairy free, etc.). My personal favorites were the burrata, Boozy Bettina pizza, and nutella fingers. Thank you Adoro Lei for a great, memorable night!",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

The Caesar salad was one of the best I have had, and the pizza was delicious. We also got the purses pasta that was so unique and very, very tasty.We got to meet the owner and talk to him about the food which was fun too.

Â I can't imagine they'll be open in a couple of years without some serious changes. Â The place was pretty empty on a very nice Friday evening...but that didn't stop the place from being extremely loud - they play ridiculously loud hip-hop music which I guess helps their loud suburban patrons (think Real Housewives of New Jersey - sorry!) feel like they're at a cool NYC restaurant. Â The food was mediocre. Â We had mini calzones (surprisingly tasteless), Worship chicken wings in Marsala/blue cheese/ bacon (weird flavor and complete overkill), Caesar salad (pretty standard), penne alla vodka (decent but we've had much better), pietro pizza (very good) and Little Queens pasta (just ok). Â Their prices are also too high given the restaurant is basically in the middle of nowhere. We were dying to get out of there...it's just so strange to be in an empty-ish restaurant playing crazy loud inappropriate music. Â On the positive side, everyone working there was very nice and accommodating, and clearly a lot of work was put into designing the place, menu, etc. Â I hope they can make some tweaks and make it, but we won't be returning anytime soon.",Adoro Lei,4.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza,, Lounges"

185,sNoTN8H_GobvyjCFart0Sg,Erica B.,4.0 star rating,Nice lil pizza joint near my work that I was looking forward to trying out for dinner. My boyfriend and I ordered the Pietro and shared it. It was delicious though I wouldn't categorize it as a 'red' pizza. We also ordered it on a gluten free crust since I have a gluten sensitivity. The crust wasn't bad at all. The menu warns that the pizza isn't baked in a gluten free oven so it may not be a safe bet for anyone with Celiac. There was also a rep from Leblon Cachaca passing around free samples of different sangria-esque varieties which was a nice perk. The music was fun and diverse.

Every detail has been perfectly planned. From the art on the walls to the table tops, even to the cutlery, a lot of planning has been put into this restaurant and the planning has paid off.
