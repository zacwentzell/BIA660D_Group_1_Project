1,pKV4fwsJZodstQzDM_Bn2Q,Katherine R.,1.0 star rating,"I am a regular here so i was caught off guard by my recent experience at the new bottomless brunch.  I typically have a great meal and service at Bin 14, but last Sunday, that was not the case. I came with 3 other friends for brunch and we all placed our appetizer order.  3 of us had the kale salad, and one friend ordered fries.  When our waiter arrived 20 minutes later with our food, he did not even stop to hear my friend say that he gave her a kale salad, when she had ordered fries.  He did not come back to check up on us for another 15 minutes, so she decided to eat the salad anyway because she was so hungry at that point.  When he came back, he mistakenly brought an order of fries for our table since he thought that's what we wanted- which was not the case.  Throughout the rest of our meal, we repeatedly had to ask 3-4 times for water.  It got to the point where another waiter noticed that our waiter was not being attentive and would come around and fill our waters and ask if we needed more drinks.Lastly, the most memorable part of brunch was having to ask for our bottomless drinks 3-4 times each time we wanted another alcoholic beverage.  My friend asked for another bloody mary THREE (3) times about an hour into the brunch.  On the third time she asked our waiter, instead of him saying anything back to her, he immediately ran to check the time clock to see if we had any time left during our 90 minute bottomless brunch limit.  He came back and told us this would be our last round, when she had asked for the drink 20 minutes beforehand and he never came back.  He blamed it on the bartenders for not making it, when we knew he just was not being attentive after he messed up our food orders, never gave us water refills, or taking 4 times to get our drinks.I was embarrassed to bring my out of town friends here after giving them rave reviews on Bin 14.

I've been here 4 or 5 times and each time I have an ok experience with average to a tad frustrating service, avg to great food, and decent ambiance. There are very few wine bar options in Hoboken so I am bound to continue coming back here. Food: They have a great variety of casual to upper scale small plates and pizza's. As far as the homemade mozz goes, thats one of the more unique plates and I can heartily recommend the truffle honey version, but not the Extra virgin olive oil, fleur de sel, cracked pepper. I've been served it cold and rock hard before - if that happens send it back because when it actually arrives warm, its delish. Interested in the pizza? Go for the Prosciutto di Parma, fig, ricotta NOT the Bacon & apple, blue, ricotta, fresnos, basil, hot hone one (WAY too much going on there and very odd tasting, and a weird choice to have on the menu in the spring). Other highlights: Baby octopus app, Tuna tartare bruschetta. NOT the Truffle fries (always soggy). Drink: Great selection of wine (obvi) and a fun fact - they do 2 oz pours in case you want to try a wine or just want a tiny glass. Service: They tend to forget about the folks in the front outdoor seating, inside gets great service, and back patio decent service. Ambiance: The outdoor back patio when its cool out with heated lamps is a cool vibe out there, though depending on your location to the heat lamps it could be chilly. The inside gets loud. Other thoughts: There is usually a wait especially in the evenings. The challenge is there is no place to wait inside and gets very awkward very quickly.

14,8eC4glirBpwudhNfqUnVFw,Katie D.,4.0 star rating,"I came here while visiting some locals who are big fans of this spot. It was a Tuesday night and the earliest time we could reserve a table was at 8:30! The place doesn't have a lot of seating, especially for parties larger than 4 people. The setting is very intimate, with candles at every table and low lighting. A great date spot! The staff was friendly enough and everything was clean. It had a social vibe to it, but we were still easily able to talk to each other with the buzz around us.If you come here, prepare to spend quite a bit of money. The waitress explained that it's a 'tapas style restaurant' so you can order lots of small plates for the table. And they are indeed small. For me this is no problem, especially being there that late at night. However, for big eaters like my husband, that's an expensive problem to have. Everything tastes great, though! We had the charcuterie platter, which has very modestly sized pieces of 3 cheeses and 3 meats. An order of meatballs, bruschetta, and bottomless mussels filled 3 people happily. The bottomless mussels (available Tuesdays) were fantastic and each bowl came with a plate of topped fries as well. I could've eaten them until morning but the offer ends at 10pm.  Being a wine bar, it has large selection of different wines. We tried the Pentimento wine and I fell in love. We tasted a few varieties for our second bottle but ended up deciding to stick with our first choice again because it was so good. The bottle was moderately priced for the quality.

It was as small, if not smaller, than the size of a regular appetizer. The ravioli was barely warm, and while it tasted fine, I left very hungry and had to go to a second joint (got some awesome manicotti) as ""real dinner."" Sure, I'm a bottomless pit, I know that - hence, I eat ALL AROUND THE CLOCK. So when I tell you I left a place hungry after an entree, which I inhaled in 3 seconds tops, I'd have to ask - what is this, children's portion? The pizza was fine but nothing special.

Gave us a taste of one and we decided to get two glasses. Received the check and it was $36!!!!The staff is crude and they think they are high and mighty.

49,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,3.0 star rating,"I have been here twice before but both were a few years ago. I came here once again a few weeks ago for dinner with my good friend.It was 8 pm and the small place was very busy, all the tables and most bar seats were taken and there were plenty of people trying to get a seat. My friend, who got there a few minutes before I did, got us two seats by the bar which were the only ones available at the time. Unfortunately those seats were very close to the door, which kept being opened and closed by the same people trying to get a seat at the restaurant, so I ended keeping my coat on during the meal.Since we were sitting by the bar, one of the bartenders was the ones to take our drink order. He then proceeded to not pay attention to us for a while when we tried to get his, or any of the other bartenders', attention in order to place a food order. I got a glass of cava while my friend ordered dry white wine, both of which came to us quickly and tasted pretty good. Due to my self imposed dietary limitations (being picky and ,more recently, not eating meat) there were not many options. I was considering getting a personal pizza and a salad but ended ordering a kale, ricotta, garlic and lemon zest pizza and truffle fries with romano and black pepper. My friend ordered the Ravioli with chicken, shiitake, caramelized onion, ricotta and braised tomato sauce. The pizza was really good although it would have not filled me up on its own and my friend enjoyed her ravioli as well. However, the truffle fries seemed overdone and were truly an overkill for me, should have definitely gone with the salad. I do no recall the music but it wasn't too loud which allowed my friend and I to have an intimate conversation.Although it has been a few years since my original visits, my impression of Bin 14 is the same: the dishes are either hit or miss (the pizzas are definitely a hit) but either way are overpriced for both the size and the quality of the food.

58,ezwXOgtYdZPHOljENymgcw,X X.,2.0 star rating,"We booked a reservation for 13 for a casual birthday dinner and were given instructions to arrive early since there are 3 seating's per night and would have to relinquish the table by 9:30, but told it would likely be free ahead of time. A few days before, the restaurant called to tell us they were not sure who took the reservation, but they absolutely could not accommodate that many people. Thankfully our party size had dwindled to 10 which they could handle. They wanted to make sure everything was going to run perfectly. This was music to our ears since we were looking for a better group experience than gourmet food, something we typically shoot for. We understand serving a large party can be tricky, but with a little attention, it can run smoothly.8 of 10 arrived by by 7:25, two were slightly delayed, but the table was not yet ready. Ten minutes later they led us in to the back to 6 seats. Someone had removed a 4 top and sat customers at it. This took several minutes of us standing in the middle of the kitchen flow before anyone could figure it out and then remove the 4 customers.Our server let us know that we were fortunate to arrive just short of what would be a packed section for him, but he had our attention now. Maybe it was harmless and poorly phrased, but something about the way he said it just sat oddly with several of us. Bin 14 serves small plates meant for sharing, but after being here several times, IMHO I did not think they could pull that off with more than 6 people so I advised everyone to order an app and entree.  Initially, I also suggested everyone order wine by the glass to take advantage of their wide offerings rather than me choosing and limiting the group to bottles. Both of these things seemed to annoy our server. We ended up ordering a few bottles for the table anyway since we had an easy going crowd and I was thankful that we did.The appetizers came and the food runners could not get it right, they brought the dishes to whomever was near and asked if it was theirs and then went around the table until they found a match. This forced all of us to help figure it out, the loud restaurant only made this game worse. After trying this for most dishes and still having one she couldn't place, I asked the runner to confer with our server to help organize things, but she didn't. The apps tasted fine. nothing spectacular. Stand outs would be a smokey octopus dish, though many of the potatoes in the paired fingerling salad were undercooked and a somewhat bland burrata dish  that should have been served closer to room temp and with some crostini. We asked for some and got cold, thick bruschetta pieces (leftover?).I wanted to see a wine list and consult someone to pair some red wine with our final courses, but as the night progressed we hardly saw our server. Additionally, I wanted to ask them to clear the app plates and bring us fresh silverware, but before I could do either our entrees were being served. As soon as I saw the runner pulling the same nonsense as before, I implored her to confer with the server because I was not happy about their inability to distribute food, but again, no luck. The entrees were just OK. One dish of diver scallops had 2 diver and one bay sized scallop, who the hell plates that and deems it passable? A short rib dish was a bit bland and there were several large pieces of Gorgonzola that were cold and threw off the balance of the grits. The crab risotto tasted ok, was texturally off. Usually good food is overshadowed by bad service, but I tend to overlook service flaws as long as the food meets acceptable standards which unfortunately, it did not.I know the standard is 15% for basic service, 20% for superior, but being close to the industry and given the types of places I frequent, I default to 20-25%. Since we were a large party 18% was included and frankly I feel robbed.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
59,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,1.0 star rating,"This place used to be one of my favorite spots in Hoboken, I'm not sure what happened. We showed up on a Thursday evening and oddly enough the place was fairly empty, so we sat down at the bar and waited a few minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us. I asked if we could have a samples of the Grenache blend, it was terrible. Super warm (75 degree warm), in fact so warm, I really couldn't get a great wine taste. Nasty. My boyfriend tried a Portuguese white wine, it tasted cheap and too sweet. He drank it. I ended up ordering a South American white. Decent at best. Bartender wasn't the most friendly bartender I have ever met. She was nice to the 'regulars', a bit indifferent towards us. Anyway, we started with the truffle honey warm mozzarella, I was expecting delicious homemade mozzarella. This was far from homemade. It tasted like mozzarella that had been sitting in a grocery store for days. Not great. The truffle honey barely had any truffle taste and the whole dish was bland and old. I then ordered crispy calamari, hot peppers, capers & lemon. The dish was terrible. 100% sure the calamari was completely frozen and was over fried. It was disgusting. My boyfriend ordered the falafel. I tried a piece, it had no taste at all and again, tasted like it was frozen and re-heated. I told the bartender I wasn't going to eat the calamari and she asked if I wanted something instead. I thought my boyfriend was going to smack me because he was go over the restaurant that all he wanted to do was leave. I have no idea why, but I really wanted to give this place another shot, so I said, sure I will have the jerk octopus instead. GROSS. I just wanted one dish to taste good. Nope. Nothing. The octopus was mushy and nasty. I've gotten octopus many times in my life and this was the worst tasting octopus I have ever had. I ate it because I felt bad giving back yet another dish. All and all, terrible food and I thought it was me, but my boyfriend expressed how extremely disappointed he was as well.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

As we waited, I couldn't even have a conversation with my wife as rap music blasted.  Don't get me wrong, I like rap, but when you go to a wine bar you expect a little bit of ambiance. At the very least, turn it down!We ordered some food (pizza and bruschetta). Both were overpriced and underwhelming. I ordered a glass of wine.  The bartender poured a tasting drop, set the bottle down and walked away for 5 minutes.  I wasn't sure what to do!

I'm sure the only reason it wasn't packed was the sub-zero weather. We started off with a delicious Grilled Octopus - a nice sized tentacle cooked very well just succulent and tender enough for my liking. Since this is a joint all about the small plates, we got quite a few apps. The next goodies were the Lobster Chowder special - the juicy lobster bits were complimented with potatoes, corn and bacon bits; Truffle Fries with a sprinkling of blue cheese; Pork Belly Bruschetta which was admittedly expensive at $4 per piece but it was jam packed with pork belly and good flavor! We also got a delicious Duck Risotto. And since the portions were kind of small and my wife is kind of pregnant - we went and ordered a Pork Belly pizza (yeah, we went pig crazy this evening). We couldn't finish the pizza so we got it in a to go box... however, we bumped into an old neighbor and sadly forgot our to go box...Everything was really top notch - even my cocktail which I do not know the name of but can vaguely say had some cranberry, vodka and another juice in it. It's a good thing that we ordered lots of extras since they don't offer any real dessert. Sorry meat and cheese platter - a dessert menu must have sweets on it!! The tables are little small and close to each other - simultaneously giving the joint a cozy intimate feel and a chance to get elbowed in the head by a server.

I ordered the prosciutto, fig & ricotta pizza which was delicious.Our waitress has Celiac disease so she knew exactly what was safe to eat and what was not.  Almost everything on the menu could be modified to fit someone with a gluten allergy/intolerance.I will definitely be back!",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

86,sXobXHzzhE4YeYbELfmo-w,Erika W.,5.0 star rating,"Bin does a lot right (and has a few areas for improvement) but I'm giving them 5 stars because of their amazing service.  I've been coming here since they opened.  I think I was literally at Bin on it's opening night.   I've probably been here 100 times since. I've never ever had a bad experience with a single member of the wait staff.  The wait staff, bartenders, hostesses - well and the manager is about as nice, friendly and helpful as it gets.  I recently knew I had to get on and write a review when I was coming in for brunch 2 Saturdays ago.  I called to ask about a reservation, since a member of our party was older and cannot stand for prolonged periods of time.  I explained that I knew they didn't take reservations, but if there is anything they can do, it would really make our day.  The manager reserved a table for us.  And, he went a step further and made sure it was the front booth so she didn't have  to walk far to the back.  In a town where brunch ""reservations"" don't really exist, I thought it was amazing that the manager was able to accommodate us so graciously.  The food is great - and keeps getting better.  They change the menu frequently and have some of the most interesting brunch options in Hoboken.  I love their 2 eggs and a meatball and the chorizo toast.   They also have a bloody mary bar - which leaves a little room for improvement (needs more peppers, pickled veggies - and less powdered spices).  Some more unique options might be nice too - a thai bloody mary?  Their pizzas are terrific - and come in both regular and whole wheat crust (I think they have a gluten free option too?).  They have great meatballs, usually some nice homemade pastas and always changing veggie sides.  My only criticism is they do dinner in ""seatings,"" which means you can only eat during one of two seating times.  Therefore, I've only EVER had dinner at the bar - and only when I've come early enough to get a seat (before 6).    We typically go there for late afternoon snacks and wine on the weekends - which suits us just fine. Anthony's other restaurant (Anthony David's) went through a major overhaul a couple of years ago - and came out exponentially better from what was already a great  restaurant.  I hope Anthony Pino keeps the hits coming with his new joint uptown.  I'm very excited for the opening.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Promptly and abruptly, at 9:15pm, while we still had food and wine at the table, we were told we had to leave because another party had reservations at 9:30. They also did this to a table two down from us. It was an awful experience and NOT how you treat customers who are spending their hard earned money (our check was just about $300 for 4 people), at your restaurant AND chose your restaurant out of the many others in Hoboken that are just as good to celebrate a very special event.

Our waitress came to take our drink order (never caught her name) and I was immediately feeling rushed to order by her. We placed an order for a warm truffle mozzarella and some bruschetta. I was BLOWN AWAY to learn that the bruschetta was $3....per piece. $12 for bruschetta? I mean some restaurants put it on the table for free. Seemed a bit steep considering the tomatoes were hardly seasoned. The crab poppers were actually a crab popper...singular. And it was just a run of the mill lonely crab cake. The eggplant dish was delicious. The Bolognese fries were the only dish I felt we actually got our money's worth of. What is this? A center for ants?I would definitely recommend sampling some of the pizzas. We did the truffle pizza which could have had some more truffle oil on it if you ask me. The Salami Picante, burrata, shishito peppers, mozzarella pizza was my favorite. I could have eaten the entire thing.

101,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"A solid 4.5 star place in Hoboken. Start to finish, everything about this meal was excellent. We showed up at 8:30 on a Thursday, without reservations. Surprisingly (or perhaps not surprisingly) there were no tables available. The host got us a seat in the back and a drink while he said he would find us a table. 15 minutes later, we are seated at a table out back.The waitress was helpful in her suggestions for both wine and food.I'll give my usual rundown on each thing we had, but I will say this much... there was not a single bite I did not enjoy.Salmon Tartar Crostini - very unique dish here. The salmon came in a orange blossom honey, so at first you are hit with the sweetness, followed by a lingering honey taste. Very good, very different.Steak Tartar Crostini - this was a more classic preparation, but don't let that fool you into thinking it was excellent, because it really was.Grilled octopus, andouille, cannellini and cauliflower ragout - another totally unique dish. The octopus was charred nicely and perfectly tender, and the cauliflower absorbed the nice spicy tomato sauce.Confit pork belly, brioche toast, tomato bruschetta, balsamic - Fatty and tender pork belly served on a toasty, fluffy, chewy bread with your typical bruschetta accompanyments (tomatos, garlic, olive oil, and balsami). Another interesting take on some classic items and it just works.Truffle and creamy taleggio pizza - I cannot put my finger on it, but the cheese on here reminded me of something. Something from my childhood. Regardless, the pizza was thin, crispy, and delicious, and came speckeled with nice pieces of black truffles. Excellent pizza.Cavatelli, poached mussels, peas, spicy tomato cream sauce - another fantastic, and uniquely flavored dish. The pasta here was homemade, chewy, and tender, with subtly spicy sauce, accented by the pop of the peas when you get them in a bite. Excellent. Really excellent.Food wise, really just fantastic. This might be my new favorite place in Hoboken.The one drawback... this is expensive for Hoboken. The 6 dishes, bottle of wine, plus 2 more glasses, tax came to $145 before tip. Is it worth it?

We had one poor experience with the service, but found that was just a bad day and isn't true of all the staff. Bin 14 feels like an authentic wine bar which is refreshing. It's quaint with dim lighting and exposed brick. The waiters seem to know their menu well and are open to let you taste one or two wines to help pick the perfect pairing. The portions are on the smaller side so plan to order a few things in order to feel satisfied. My husband and I usually order 3 -4 menu items for dinner. The last time we got the meatballs (delicious, flavorful), the old school pizza (tasty, would order again) and the Bison short ribs for our main entree which were a home-run. If you're looking for a romantic or simply quality dinner I would recommend Bin 14. It's not great for parties of more than 4 and there is typically a wait during prime evenings Thurs - Sun.

110,TnDSQ_4cKby6Y2gwEx-NLA,Tyler W.,1.0 star rating,"Below is the email I wrote to Bin 14 themselves, before deciding to take my disappointment to Yelp.  All I wanted in return was a simple apology, and assurance that my experience at Bin 14 this time around was nothing more than one bad night.  Apparently, management doesn't care enough to reach out - and it clearly shows in the form of the downward spiral this place has been in over the past few months.  Due to length restrictions, I've removed a few paragraphs: My Girlfriend had made reservations for a party of four, as we had friends visiting who had never been to Hoboken.  We decided to choose Bin 14, as we've always enjoyed coming here together or with a group.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, slightly early for our reservation, we were greeted by the hostess who begun the conversation by saying, ""Just a heads up, we are going to be really slow tonight, so I wouldn't expect to have your drink and food orders taken for about 15-20 minutes after your seated"".  Not a very pleasing start to our evening, but we sat down nonetheless.  The server finally arrived at our table to take our drink orders.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine and a martini. He never once mentioned his name, and had a hard time helping us choose our wine.  There are only 4 bottles of Rose - all we wanted to know was whether the options available were sweet or dry - apparently they were 'basically all the same' according to our server.  After about 5 minutes, the server brought our bottles of wine, returned to the bar for the martini, then brought that to our table as well.  At that point, we told him we were ready to put our appetizers in, knowing that we may not see him for a while after that.  He responded by saying ""Ok no problem....be right back"".  We weren't sure what wasn't clear about wanting to put our order in, but he then disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. At this point we were seated for about 30+ minutes before the server returned to take our food order.  Already frustrated with the inattentiveness, we couldn't have imagined it would get worse.  It did.. We decided to place our orders for both our appetizers and Entree's so we weren't left waiting come that time.  We put our order in for about 5 appetizers, then followed with our entrees.  My girlfriend was met with rude criticism of her order because it was ""so boring"".  The server asked, ""Why would you come here and order that? There's so many other things on the menu!"".  The first time he said it, we played along and asked his recommendation.  Not only did we not once receive a recommendation from him, but he repeatedly insulted my girlfriend for her choice.  Finally, as he finished pouring a glass of wine for my friends girlfriend, he must have realized enough was enough.  He concluded the interaction by attempting to place the wine bottle back on the table, but instead slamming it onto a water glass which resulted in the glass breaking.The server returns a minute later with the glass, proceeds to ask how we're doing and how our food was.  He then pours a glass of red wine for my friend, and while attempting to place the bottle of red wine on the table, hits my friends girlfriends wine glass, spilling the wine all over the table and myself.  As you can imagine, at this point, I was thoroughly disgusted. We received our entrees, and they were all very good.  No complaints regarding our food or wine choices for the evening.  Our server was walking towards our table from the back of the restaurant, and without fail drops and shatters a handful of plates literally within one foot of our table.  At this point we couldn't even believe what was happening.  It almost felt as though we were on hidden camera to capture our reactions.  We had finally had enough, as my girlfriend and I were getting tired of apologizing to our friends for the experience.  We asked for the bill, paid for our evening, and left.  We talked about our server the rest of the night, and even into the next day because of how unsettling the entire scenario was.  I'll conclude by saying I hope this was a one-off night, and not something we can expect to happen on a regular basis.  We do enjoy coming to your restaurant, but are still undecided if we'll ever be back.  We attempted to show friends what both Hoboken and Bin 14 have to offer, and were extremely disappointed with how this evening played out.  I can guarantee that in the case that we do return, we will immediately ask for a new server if we receive the same gentleman.  Not even a simple reply, to apologize for the disastrous evening we just went through?  Get your act together Bin...",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

We're huge fans of Bin and love to come here after work, and we really wanted to try the new menu. I had the Dead Kennedy cocktail which was sweet but not overly sweet. I really enjoyed it. It had vodka, ginger beer, cherry liqueur and maraschino in it. We started out with the Jerk Octopus, which was probably the best octopus dish I've ever had. The Kale & Cauliflower salad was delicious... and this is coming from probably the only person in the world who doesn't like kale. My co-workers had the chicken wings and the chorizo pizza and raved about both while I had the cauliflower pizza all to myself and it was delicious, with ricotta, black truffles and Taleggio.

120,FYFmHgtLBe-FSiTnarITEg,Kelle C.,4.0 star rating,"Had a lovely time at Bin 14 last night, thanks to the recommendations of Yelpers. I made reservations but it might not have been necessary, as we sat mostly alone on the super-cute outdoor patio. It was a bit cool but with the heating lamps, comfortable with a light sweater and much quieter than inside. Vino : him - Merlot, me - Riesling We were both pleased with the selections but what is with the oversized wine glasses trend? They look great but take up so much room on the table and require a quite undignified stem-up / head-back tip to finish. Primi: Homemade Mozzarella with Truffle Honey, Mushroom Bruschetta, Roma Tomato & Ricotta Bruschetta.   I enjoyed the mozz more than he did (he wished it was warmer), but we both enjoyed the bruschetta. The waitress gave fair warning that the servings were small. The Bruschetta comes so piled high with toppings, I would have preferred two crostini instead of one to reduce the spill factor. Secondi: We shared a Margarita pizza (added ricotta), and a side of mushrooms. Pleased with both, though the mushrooms were a bit rough chopped and not all pieces cooked all the way though. Service: Our waitress, Allison, was so lovely and knowledgeable. She checked on us regularly without being intrusive, and was politely amused at our indecisive antics. We hope she enjoys her vacation! Price: Spendy for sure. Those tiny plates add up fast. I might skip the bruschetta next time and just do the side of veg. If it was so great, where's the last star? No hot drinks and no dessert makes K a sad girl. My poor date was getting over a cold and was desperate for a cup of tea.  I appreciate a small menu but it was such a lovely meal, we would have liked to linger over espresso. A sorbet would have been a nice palate cleanser after that carb and cheese bomb of a meal.

We shared the beet salad, tomato bruschetta, cauliflower, broccolini and a mushroom/arugala pizza. All very good.I was disappointed that they didn't have any kind of champagne; just prosecco. The prosecco was not that great either. I know I'm kind of a wine/champagne snob, but I would expect to see better options at a self-proclaimed wine bar. My friend was VERY disappointed that they didn't serve desert...which really is kind of odd. The service was pretty good.

We spoke about another 10 minutes as I finished my drink and then the staff came by to remind us they had other reservations coming in a few minutes.

I didn't find our waitress to be particularly friendly or helpful, especially after she made it quite clear again that we had to be out of there in 1.5 hours. The food itself was pretty oily, even the grilled veggies were drenched in olive oil (so you think you are ordering something light based on the menu description but end up with more calories and fat than a snickers bar). My mussels also had sand in it. The food comes in small (posh-wannabe) portions but just isn't that amazing.

Our waitress was great, I'm sorry I don't remember her name.  She gave recommendations for wine based on our preferences and let us sample before ordering a glass.  We ended up splitting a bottle of Pasini Azienda Agricola San Giovanni - I liked it so much I looked up what liquor stores carry it when I got home.We ordered a ton of food.  We would have been fine with 2 entrees and one appetizer but we wanted to try a few different things and ended up eating all of it.  The other reviews are correct - none of the portions are large and the food is not cheap but I feel like that is typical of a wine bar.  We started with the mozzarella in olive oil (one large piece to be shared), the meatballs (2), and the truffle fries (2-3, maybe 4 can split).  I recommend all of the dishes.  The fries were actually great when dipped in the red sauce from the meatballs.  I ordered the duck risotto which was good and my fiance ordered the salami picante pizza.  I think our favorite part was the cheese.  There were 2 women sitting next to us who split a pizza and a cauliflower dish for dinner - you can make the meal as large or small as you want.Overall, I would definitely go back.  So glad we tried it!",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
151,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,4.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I took advantage of the lovely spring weather on Saturday (05/23) and headed over to Bin 14 for a nice brunch. We were initially put off by the empty host table when we entered, and there were only two people sitting inside. While we stood at the entrance, hemming and hawing, a waiter came up to us and bluntly asked, ""What's up folks? Are we staying or are we going?"" That settled it. We stayed.Since it was rather warm indoors, we decided to sit and eat outside. I wasn't in the mood for anything special to drink and just ordered water, while my boyfriend ordered coffee. Our waiter (the same guy who asked us if we were staying or not) apologetically explained that the coffee they had available was made much earlier in the morning. He then asked if my boyfriend still wanted it. I know this sounds rude and I'm doing a poor job articulating his mannerisms, but there was something about the guy's personality that made his rough honesty really funny and appealing. He simply told it like it was. My boyfriend, amused, told him it was no problem and to go with it. Lo and behold, our waiter came around with a huge steaming cup of piping hot coffee, freshly brewed. (!) Note that we didn't ask him to brew a fresh pot, he simply did it because he felt bad about my boyfriend drinking stale coffee. That was mighty nice of him.For brunch delights, I ordered the smoked salmon plate, which came with two small pieces of focaccia toast, capers, red onions, halved grape tomatoes, arugula, and whipped cream cheese on the side. I'm not a fan of red onion, so I went ahead and made my own version of smoked salmon on toast, using the capers sparingly (I learned the hard way not to pile capers on top of anything). Everything was delicious. The salmon was a perfect consistency, and wasn't chewy or hard, and there were no unpleasant spiny bits. The only downside was that I didn't have enough toast, and I had to ask another server for some more.My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelet with peppers, onions, and cheddar cheese, and he liked it. He especially liked the sauteed potatoes that were served alongside it; he thought they were cooked well and added a nice savory touch to the meal.Towards the end of our meal, a random bird (pigeon? starling?) flew overhead and shat directly onto the corner of our table, and also on my purse. Fortunately, my purse was zipped closed and nothing inside got messed up, although we spent the better part of five minutes mopping up the green goo. A female server stopped by to check in on us and was properly horrified at what happened, apologizing profusely, even though we assured her it wasn't her fault. She then told us a funny story about how she and a friend went out for dinner and her friend's mudslide got knocked over by a gust of wind and fell directly into her open purse. All things considered, I was lucky.Despite this little incident, I was mostly pleased with my experience here, and I would like to come here again at some point to try some of their small plates.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

We usually always get a table right away because we go early (before 7pm) however if you want to have a later dinner, definitely make a reservation. Usually they will say that they have a table but they need it back by a certain time, which is fine with me. The food is incredible and one of the main reasons why I tried this place in the first place was their gluten free options, and now I can't stay away. I've had the GF Margherita pizza and the GF Sausage Broccolini pizza, both amazing and the perfect size. They also have, in my opinion, the best truffle fries in Hoboken. They can do many gluten free substitutions so you can enjoy almost anything on the menu. The service is great and they are very knowledgable about their wine. This is the restaurant that I take family and friends who are visiting because I feel that the classy and modern, yet rustic atmosphere truly embodies what Hoboken is all about.

158,v7C6Kz3eZW0I_V7JzbDk5g,Brad M.,4.0 star rating,"My wife and I usually try to go to Anthony David's for Valentine's Day dinner, but this year their reservations were filled earlier than usual. The hostess on the phone said by the end of January. So we decided to try Bin 14, which has the same owners and executive chef as Anthony David's. So my review is going to be a comparison of their two pre-fix Valentine's Day dinners, since this is the only meal I've had at Bin 14.It was Valentine's Day, so of course it's going to cost more than usual. The Bin 14 dinner was $65pp (Anthony David's is usually closer to $75, but they're BYOB). Bin 14 (a wine Bar) had some drink and wine specials, and a nice wine pairing for an additional $35pp, but that was a little too rich for our blood, so we just purchased a bottle from their wine list. The server was very knowledgeable about the wines, and even though we didn't do the pairing, the tables on both sides of us did, and since the tables are so close together we were able to eavesdrop about each type of wine they had.The atmosphere at Bin 14 is very nice. I'd describe it as ""trendy-rustic."" No blaring TVs so it's a good date spot. As for the food, there were three courses: an appetizer, entree and dessert. Anthony David's usually has four courses and also gives you a bread basket, so Anthony David's definitely wins in the quantity department.  The food at Bin 14 was excellent, however, I was still a little hungry afterwards. Thankfully I didn't order the scallops entree because while they were very good (I had a bite of my wife's), there were only three half-dollar sized scallops on the plate.My next visit to Bin 14 will probably be to try out one of their wine tastings or their late night menu which looked pretty good. But for a full blown dinner, I rather not still be hungry after spending $200. Next year I'm calling Anthony David's for a reservation on January 1 for Valentine's Day.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Everything we had loved on the menu from our first time in October was unavailable tonight - from the bottle of Malbec we requested to the meatballs and various other small plates - it was a bit of a let down to come uptown and not be able to order what we had been craving (from our first time!). We ended up ordering several rounds of small plates - meats, cheeses, and more, to an entire bottle of wine. Once we had finished our bottle, we got an additional glass to sit and enjoy the evening. We had come with a 6 pm reservation. In the middle of this last glass of wine, our waitress came and made us feel extremely unwelcome and asked us to hurry up because the 7:45 reservation had arrived. I could potentially understand this request from the waitress had we come and ordered one thing to split - but due to the fact that we had made a reservation and ordered quite a bit and at this point had paid the bill and tipped generously... I had expected to at least be able to enjoy my meal/wine in the time that I saw fit. Being rushed out the door was not appreciated and unfortunately I have to say moving forward - I will be taking my wine & tapas nights elsewhere.

You would think a restaurant like this would be such a win in this town! Their selection is fantastic, and the servers know what's up. I've only been disappointed by 1 selection, and in the half dozen times that I've been there since, I haven't seen that server, so let's just assume she wasn't a good fit.The food selection rotates somewhat seasonally. Via weekend specials, Bin 14 does a good job at keeping up with what is in season. But the not-to-miss dishes would have to be the bone marrow, pecorino fries, blue crab bruschetta, foie gras bruschetta, the beet salad and the mussels. I've never once been disappointed when ordering those items, and my pup Luna especially loves when I have the bone marrow because it means she gets a delicious treat once I get home! Are the prices at Bin 14 on the high side? Probably. But you're paying for pretty darn good food... So you're probably asking why the 1 star reduction? I've found that service is not the most consistent. Sometimes the waiter/waitress is always around and sometimes I can't find them for a stretch of time - almost always when I'm antsy to continue my evening.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Like everything in Hoboken, parking was difficult to find.The place is small, and definitely popular as I heard numerous times throughout our meal that any empty tables were reserved for those with reservations and a conversation with a waiter trying to convince a group of 2 girls that a seat in the back wasn't the best but he could try to re-arrange the table to squeeze them in. Glad we had reservations!We shared 2 bottles of Malbec. Started with 3 cheeses which our waiter picked (stinky, hard, and soft) and 3 meats (including the wild boar). The cheeses and meats were accompanied by bread, fig spread, tiny pickles, and honey. The cheese was pretty good (too bad I can't remember the names). The meats were great especially the wild boar -- yum yum. We also ordered the brussel sprouts which were delicious (served with bacon), the octopus (which had a charred taste to it but loved the sauce and spicy sausage with it), the truffle fries (delicious!). We wanted to try the spicy lamb sausage and the bone marrow but our waiter said it would be too much (wish we would have ordered it!).For my half-entree, I tried the crispy pork belly on sweet potato puree. It was presented as 3 large strips on a big bed of orange puree. The reason that I love pork belly is because it is usually served soft which helps it hold its flavor -- crispy pork belly on the other hand was a bit weird. The outside was so crispy I kept eating and chewing and hoping that I would feel a squishy inside. It looked and tasted more like dry pulled pork. Unfortunately Bin 14 had no desserts which disappointed my party. I was okay with it since I don't really care for sweets but if I had known I would have ordered more food! I didn't leave stuffed.Overall, the dining experience was great. Waiter was a bit much in the beginning and then was MIA towards the end.

My parents were in town for lunch so my boyfriend and I took them here, we were seated in the backyard which had warm heating lamps. I ordered the ""salad"" with beets and Milanese chicken which only had about 3 pieces of arugula on it - I would not consider this to be a salad, it was a $17 dish for one piece of chicken and a few beets. My boyfriends salmon benedict came out cold, and my stepmom's burger came out overdone. We waited for our waitress to come over to let her know about our issues with our meals, but she never came back over, and since we were starving we just ate it anyway. Annoyed, we waited for our check - but we had to actually ask the bus boy to bring it over because our waitress never came back over.

After the waitress came back 30 min later, I said I would pay for it but couldn't drink it due to the sour taste. She grabbed my glass, sipped from it and then tried to argue with me about it!  During the entire meal, the owner or manager was screaming at the line cooks about turning the food out.  One chef threatened to quit and walk out.

The fresh mozzarella is to die for and I absolutely LOVE their gluten free pizzas...my boyfriend is obsessed with the meatballs. I also love that their menu is seasonal and they offer different selections based on whats fresh and in season.

DO NOT COME HERE IN A BIG GROUP.  Parties of more than 4, go to Madison next door.  If you don't have a reservation, do not bother waiting for a table,  sit at the bar, you will get served faster, bar tenders are awesome, food comes out faster too.  If there are no seats, yea they shove you in that awkward area, which, maybe they should re think that policy, because it really seems to piss people off (including me). BUT, the food and wine is out of this world. It's expensive for the portions, but it's a wine bar, what do you want? Pork Belly, all of the bruschetta, truffle pizza, lobster (I think?) poppers are favorites, but I've never had anything I didn't love   They have this italian craft beer Fravort, best beer I've ever tasted.  Everyone there knows their stuff.

He suggested affordable wine and pointed out the dishes that were easiest for sharing.

I ordered one Bruschetta with Mushrooms on it and it cost $6 (and the bread was black all around the edges; it was burnt). The Asparagus was tasty as were the baby carrots. But I feel all of the of the negatives outweigh any positives in this place. Wait staff are clearly students who would rather not be there. If you are still eager to try it, bring:1) A coat, because you WILL freeze (they don't even have a curtain around the front door, so if it is cold out, you will freeze every time someone comes in or out- which means, even when it is COLD out, they still have the AC on and you are freezing.

The place gets quite busy even on a weeknight so i would recommend making a reservation.  Service is attentive for given the high volume for a small restaurant and no one will rush you out so you can fully enjoy the experience.  Though, it was a weekday so I'm not sure how it would be on a weekend...We skipped dessert but all in all i enjoyed my experience and felt the meal was complete.  Hats off to the chef for creating a interesting (though nothing particularly out of the ordinary) spring menu.  nice touches ; bin 14 wine and custom wood branded tableware, exposed kitchen and ""raw"" atmosphere add a nice element in enjoying your meal comfortably.

Oops - however, this was such a nice way to start the meal that you might consider adding it. Just sayin.For a table appetizer we ordered the truffle fries and sides of bacon mayo and chipotle ketchup. I wasn't a fan of either sauce, and honestly they weren't the best fries I've ever had. We also ordered a lamb sausage pizza, which was a great sharing appetizer for 4 people. The pizzas are small personal pies. I could have used some sort of wet ingredient to tie it all together, maybe a sauce on the side?Entree was the veal tagliatelle. Awesome. Perfect portion size too. Friend got the risotto - a little salty but tasty. Wine - great recommendation of a Malbec. They also informed us you can buy take out bottles for 1.5 times the price of a glass. What a perfect evening in? Take out & take out wine. Love it. Personally - even though its owned by the same people as Anthony & David's it very much pales in 'crave-ability'.

I guess we can heat it up for you."" The dish returns. This time the fish is burnt and almost un-eatable.  Immediately upon finishing our entrees and before I had finished my glass of wine the waiter basically tells us that we had to vacate.Updated as of January 2015: I have had a handful of better experiences at Bin 14 since my initial visit.

246,W0fNr55M5Ae1iCf7mFE2wg,Laurie M.,3.0 star rating,"Went to Bin 14 on Saturday for a dinner with another couple, had a mixed experience. The good: the food was generally tasty, the wine was great. We had a bunch of dishes, favorites were the truffle  honey mozzarella, salami pizza (they are individual size, thin crust) and the truffle fries. We also tried the meatballs, bolognese pasta, some bruschettas.. everything was tasty, warm and well prepared. Portions were small and it was expensive, but that's what you get. The wine was also great and our server was excellent at recommending wine within our price range and taste level. The bad: I hadn't seen this in reviews, so I wanted to bring attention to it - they do seatings on weekend evenings, apparently. This was mentioned when I confirmed the reservation, but (my fault) I had called back to confirm in a subway station and honestly didn't pay much attention. I also didn't think that an expensive restaurant would be kicking you out after less than two hours at a table, but apparently, that's their policy (again, at least on weekends). We had the 7:45 seating, and when we wanted to order another bottle of wine at 9ish, the server asked if we would really be finishing it before 9:30, because the next reservation arrived then. The server (pleasant enough, great wine knowledge, sort of scarce all night until it was time to kick us out) then lurked around the table until we got up and left. It's not the server's fault, restaurant policy, but I wouldn't eat there again (at least not for dinner at a table) as long as this remains their practice. Our tab was over $250, and we would've stayed and ordered more. It broke up our evening, and if I'm paying that much for a meal, I don't want to be rushed out the door. At any other restaurant, we would've enjoyed another bottle of wine and been able to catch up with our friends. I get that it's a small place, but, to me, part of the idea of nicer restaurants is that you're paying for the ambiance and experience in addition to food/wine. For me, getting pressured to leave after less than two hours kind of ruined that - especially when it's a small plate style meal, so you tend to keep ordering, drinking and chatting. I should've asked the hostess for more details when she confirmed my reservation, and it's their right to make this policy and they do try to communicate it, but it was irritating to me, and I wouldn't recommend going there unless you're sure you're comfortable with it. To be fair, I may go back if I was sitting at the bar or it was a night when time limits weren't enforced - I think it's only a Friday/Saturday thing. But the food, while tasty, isn't good or interesting enough to justify their prices and their seating policy, so I certainly wouldn't make it a destination for a nice dinner out.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

I was looking over the wine list and our waiter asked what I liked and then said I will bring over a few for you to try. We must have sampled 8 different wines! Each in my party of four ended up drinking two or three tremendous wines. The waiter even told us that based on their pours, just order by the glass and not the bottle the price typically works out the same. Great advice, we all ordered what we liked. Now the food. Yes small plates so be ready for it. Even the entrees are on the smaller side. Given that, we ordered a cheese plate and a few cured meats, lobster bruschetta, fig and prosciutto pizza, and we split a few orders of meatballs and the bolognese.

I was given some menus to look at and the hostess was really nice and said she can take our drink order while we are waiting to be seated. We waited approximately 15 minutes and another table in the back opened up. We were seated outside in the tent that was set with heated lamps. It was a really nice setting and many couples and other customers seem to be having a great time talking and having their food. We then placed our order. Absolutely LOVED that they have so many wine selections and it comes with several different sizes to choose from. I chose the smallest size because I don't drink too much.

The atmosphere is wonderful, from the spacious bar to the intimate tables and the small stool area in the back.

If you're looking for a sophisticated, warm spot for a romantic evening, you cannot do better in Hoboken. The food is outstanding, delicious small plates packed with flavor and perfect accompaniment to the wines. The cheese selection is likewise fantastic. It can be a costly tab, especially if you try numerous items, but I've never felt like I was ripped off. It's all worth it. As for the pissy negative reviews here, chalk them up to the clientele in Hoboken, a breed of entitled narcissists who think it's okay to take up a table in a tiny establishment for hours and hours (taking money away from the servers and inconveniencing waiting diners), or whose limited palates demand the ""right"" to reject a bottle of wine because they don't like it.

I like this place a lot because it stands out from the rest. It has a certain feel to it and that feel is consistent. Its up to date, hip, and will let you have a good time.I have been here twice already and I have nothing but good things to say for both of those times. The first time was with a girl, and her and I had a blast. We loved being able to sample and choose different wines to drink, and the dishes were just the right size that each of us could share and have it be enough. It has a good but subtle romantic atmosphere.The second time I was there was with my roommate and his friend. The three of us had a couple of beers, and some wine while grabbing some snacks and pre-gaming before we met up with the rest of the group. They have a small beer selection, but the list is exclusive to finer beers only. You will not find any cheap beers here. The atmosphere for this, a cool relaxed hang out spot.The staff here is pretty cool and extremely knowledgeable. They can point you in the right direction if you are looking for a certain taste, or if your not sure they always have something good to recommend to you. They know their menu and the wines almost inside and out. The staff is also extremely friendly and on each time I have been in some great conversations with the bartenders and the manager. I keeping my fingers crossed that I can work my way into ""commoner"" status.Overall I gave Bin 14 four stars because of their great staff, the good atmosphere, and the good selection and wide variety of wines.

The octopus in the octopus small plate was perfectly cooked. 3. The lobster bruschetta was tasty according to my friend.4. The meat ball small plate was tasty.5. The proportions of the small plates were decent.The bad:1. We decided to order a bottle of wine and some cheese to start; we said we'd keep a menu and order more as we went.  The server was obviously not happy with this as I watched him make a mental note that we weren't a ""money"" table.  He tried to talk us into a more expensive bottle by saying the one we chose had a ""weird"" taste. ??? I was a server for a long time and understand the disappointment of a table that isn't lucrative, but it's part of the business. Not to mention that we were, in fact, a money table, if he'd just be patient. 2. The white bean and sausage that the octopus sat on was completely flavorless.3. The wild mushroom bruschetta, the date gorg and bacon bruschetta, and the tomato bruschetta were all bland.4. The bruschetta was pricey at $5 or $6 for one piece.5. The cheese plate didn't offer anything too interesting.6. I asked more than one person for help with our order (we received the wrong thing) and every one of them said ""I'm not your server"".

Met a friend for a glass of wine on a weekday, and managed to snag two seats at the bar early. Lucky we did, because around 7 or so the place started filling up fast and I overheard the hostess say that all the tables were reserved. We were fine with the bar though; the bartender was friendly and knowledgeable and made spot on recommendations based on what we liked. He was also nice to point out when one he was recommending was a bit pricey. I was going to try a different wine for my second glass, and he tried in vain to find one I'd like even better but alas he got it right the first time so I ended up sticking to that one! We got some truffle fries to snack on while deciding if we wanted to dine there or not. The fries, plus the menu tempted us into staying and I'm glad we did. The arancini with mozzarella and mini pizza were both good, but the gnudi was excellent. Soooo good. The portions are small (though I thought the gnudi was a solid portion), especially if you are a guy, but if you order a few to share it works out well. I left stuffed! I do wish they had a dessert menu but luckily they had some truffles left from their new year party that they were giving out and those were the perfect ending to the meal.

If you make reservations on the weekends, they do 90 minute seatings at 6:30, 8, and 9:30. We were in the 9:30 seating.Our biggest turnoff about this place was the waitress. She was downright nasty and seemed annoyed whenever we asked her a question. Another waitress who brought out some of our food was so nice and accommodating. The waitress had recommended 3 plates per person. We only ended up ordering 2 each and we're glad we did, because we all ended up with leftovers. Maybe we just don't have big appetites? We ordered a few plates of the truffle and sweet potato fries. The truffle fries were delicious and the sweet potato fries had a little kick to them.We each got a pizza and an entree. And if you can't eat gluten, they offer gluten free pizza, which is awesome! Everyone seemed to like their pizza, but it was bigger than we thought it would be. Not saying it was huge, but several of us felt we could have just eaten that and it would have been enough. I know their plates are meant for sharing, but at least we all had leftovers! I got the prosciutto pizza and I liked it, but it was a little dry. For an entree I got the pulled pork, and it came out in half of an acorn squash. It was good, but after tasting one friend's risotto and another friend's short rib lasagna, I wish I had gotten one of those instead.The food was definitely good and the ambiance is nice, and it was a good setting for a group.

Seasonal and interesting. Order small at first and reorder as needed.Wines on the other hand, not so much. Admittedly, I've been getting my ""snob"" on over subpar wines lately. A wine bar should have some real gems but on our last outing 4 of the 6 wines we tried (there was a flight in there so, relax) were pretty cheap/bad. And one was definitely corked. I feel like they're watching their margins rather than supplying great wines. Note to owners: people will pay for great wines.And on that note and to be fair, nothing is very expensive.

We didn't plan to eat here from the start, and it was a Sunday evening around 6pm.  Not exactly dinner time or crowd yet when our waitress found out we just wanted drinks, she acted so shocked. It was like we were thieves. Told us the tables are only for dinner and you have to sit at the bar.  Which I totally would have, except when we walked in, the bar was full & we didn't see any seats but the restaurant tables were empty. They cleared two bar seats at the very front for us, and while I was like whatever, I could tell my BF had gotten offended and didn't want to stay there anymore.  So we left.  I was in such a chill mood that evening I didn't care until I got home and I thought, that was kinda messed up.My point is, if it's Sat night at 8pm, I totally get it.  But even then, don't treat potential customers like freeloaders just because they want a drink. But at 6pm, on a Sunday, in HOBOKEN that's being a bit too egotistical. It's not the Meatpacking.  Even though the place was only half full with several open tables, maybe she had an off-night and I will give it another shot.

Fortunately, I went with my very close friend who has similar culinary tastes and is quite comfortable with sharing. However, if you are planning a dinner date with a notoriously picky eater or greedy grazer, you should probably make those reservations elsewhere (or ditch this jerk all together. He or she is probably a bore). Just sayin'...The small plate motif works well here, as it allows you to sample a wide range of carefully crafted dishes. The bruschetta is delicious (note that it is a single piece per order...definitely get a separate one for each diner), as is the calamari (though it is more breaded than I like) and the pizza. All ingredients seem expertly paired, and the food tastes very fresh.Being a wine bar, they naturally have an extensive list of wines at prices to be expected for 'boken.

SOOOO good, but I wish there was more.  The pizza's are like personal size with 4 small slices.  I would have ordered 3 to be honest with you!  I need to come back to try more bruschettas as well as the mushroom risotto and anything else that has truffles in it because i have become obsessed with truffles!The atmosphere was fun, the design is sleek, the restaurant got busier as we sat there and granted it was a Saturday but it was dam cold out and it was still packed.  It was just a fantastic dinner and I will definitely be back whenever I go visit my friend again.A great date place, a great meet up place for the girls, a great quick bite to eat place.

Hoboken is infamous for bar-bro type of places, but Bin 14 is a really nice change from all of that. Small wine bar, exposed brick inside, nice seating area. We sat in the back near the kitchen.As we were ordering a fire-alarm went off for 10 minutes. It was loud and awful, I could hardly carry on a conversation with friends that I had been dying to speak with and our time was limited together, so 10 minutes of screaming over a fire-alarm is not ideal.Now, to the food. I had fresh squeezed orange juice which is always good. My boyfriend and I shared: wild mushroom/goat cheese omelet (came with hashed potatoes and a nice piece of italian bread toast), wild boar pizza, spicy lamb sausage, cinnamon sugar zeppolis, and a brioche grilled cheese with slab bacon and cheddar. Our friends got: lamb sausage omelet, pancetta eggs benedict, mushroom bruschetta, and hazelnut honey zeppolis.Highs: the zeppolis were great, sweet, fluffy and big. My boyfriends grilled cheese was great, as was my omelet. My friends seemed to both enjoy their meals, but seemed to really like the mushroom bruschetta most.Lows: the wild boar pizza was really sub par, covered in arugula, and hardly any meat on it. The lamb sausage is personally not my thing, I find it tastes really gamey, so that's not their fault. WHAT is their fault is charging 4 dollars for a sausage link the size of my index finger (I know it's tapas, but that's really expensive).Overall good experience, might go again, but will not be raving about it.

I remember it being delicious...and very busy. I also remember paying roughly $100 and change for 2 people, including a bottle of wine and several small plates. I don't think that's so bad. So, last week I decided to take my bf there for his birthday. I thought he would LOVE the rabbit pizza! I called ahead to reserve table for Sunday night. I probably called 3 days in advance and didn't have a problem getting a table. We arrived and the place was not busy. I chalk that up to being a rainy Sunday night the day after the HOB St Patricks day parade. We ordered a bottle of the Laurel Glen Syrah, it was very nice. We started with a cheese place. We chose 3 cheeses: the dante, gouda, and nettle. All were unreal. We also added prosciutto to the plate. It was very lean and tasty. Bruschetta came next. First was a tuna tartare bruschetta. The flavors were amazing - scallions and jalapenos - it reminded me a bit of guacamole. We also had a Liver mousse bruschetta. It was good. Next course was lamb sausage. To be honest, I didn't think very much of it. Kinda bland. It may have been a bit better if it was stuffed with feta or something. Oh well. Along with the lamb sausage was the sweet potato fries. Prior to that night, I had never met a sweet potato fry I had liked. Well, after this visit I can no longer make that claim. They were perfectly cooked, and the cinnamon and chipolte were wonderful. the chipolte was by no means overpowering. Every few bites you would taste a bit of it. Perfect. At this point I was feeling kinda full and probably should have stopped. But then came the rabbit pizza. Absolutely delicious. We could not finish it and ended up taking half of it home. And we still weren't done....Shortrib lasagna.. it blew my mind. Meat was super tender, sauce was amazing. Loved it. Hands down - this was truly an amazing meal. We definitely left there full. And it was priced right - $112 before tip. I'm not saying I would go once a week (I could, but my wallet couldn't) but it is worth going once in a while. High quality food, great service.

As for the food we opted with two Bruscettas, the Liver Mousse (which we still don't know if they make it on premises) and the Lobster Club. Both were quite nice but as I said we don't know if it was made on premises ... and the club was basically a Lobster salad ...

The wine list is of course varied and thorough. We grabbed a spot at the bar since the tables were booked up, but were offered a table at their outdoor enclosed and heated patio (since it was unseasonably cold for a Memorial Day weekend). Tables weren't cramped at all and the heat was just right. Our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive. He spilled some wine on my date (as an ex-waiter I've been there and done that, so no biggie) and insisted that he wanted to do something to make it up to us. She was wearing black anyway, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. As we already ate and finished our bottle, he topped us off. Good man.We had the 3 Rocks Cabernet, which was big and full. It settled well and had good balance. For food we decided to share the calamari, some mushroom bruschetta and the margherita pizza. The portions were smaller than anticipated and the bruschetta was ordered by the piece, and while good, I did not feel it was worth $4/serving. We sat outside until the patio closed at midnight, but offered a seat at the bar. We were never rushed and the atmosphere was great.

324,LAqguk9MJfbIeIFWiCMgaw,Blair B.,1.0 star rating,"Absolutely RUDE service! For an upscale restaurant, I expect to be treated in only a polite and professional manner. Instead, I experienced an unapologetic, combative, disrespectful, and obnoxious wait staff last night. I have been to Bin 14 before and was impressed with both the food and service, however, my experience last night was the complete opposite and left me feeling embarrassed and unwanted at this establishment. I will not be returning. Upon entering the restaurant in the evening of Friday, 12/4/15, my boyfriend found two empty seats at the bar. He was roughly informed by the bartender (female with brunette hair and dark glasses) that he could not sit there. When he asked if the bar seats were reserved, she responded with a ""no"" and then tried to argue with him that people were waiting to sit there. The seats were empty and no one was standing next to them, so he sat down. Like she had said, the seats were not reserved?! She tried to argue with him again, but a second bartender (female with brunette hair and a tattoo on her hand) intervened and informed him he could sit. I arrived 2 minutes later and took the empty seat next to him. When explaining the rudeness he encountered to me, the second bartender, whom had obviously eavesdropped on our discussion, interrupted our conversation and explained they wanted to seat a couple at the bar whom had been waiting for 45 minutes for their reservation. So we can't take first-come, first-serve bar seats because the restaurant incorrectly booked a reservation?  Ok, great. That would have been fine, but then this bartender proceeded to snicker to the first bartender about us and what just transpired...right in front of us! Trying to prevent this from ruining our evening, we ordered 1 glass of wine each - the O.P.P. Pinot Noir from Oregon - at $12/glass. We left $25 on the counter, blatantly giving a $1 tip. We walked out and thought this bad experience was over, but no. As we hit the sidewalk, the very polite bouncer chased us outside and informed us we had not settled our bar tab. We were then asked to go back inside and speak with a gentleman in a red plaid shirt next to the hostess stand (manager)? Ok...so we went back inside and asked the gentleman what the problem was. He told us we were short on our tab. He requested our receipt from the bartender, looked at it, and told us our bill was $25.72 with tax. We were chased down because we failed to leave $0.72 for tax?? We explained we left $25 ($24 for the two glasses of wine at $12 each and a $1 tip) and then he said to ""forget about it"" and walked away from us. No apologies for failing to look at the tab/question his staff before having us chased down for $0.72 nor for his bartender's behavior, whom obviously was annoyed we didn't leave a tip? We then threw $1 on the bar and left.  I have never been treated so disrespectfully at an establishment where the upmost professionalism is expected. If Anthony Pino expects to continue to be successful in an increasingly affluent town with his upscale restaurants, he needs to re-evaluate his staff to ensure they understand how to treat the type of diners who frequent these places.  Honestly, you would probably interact with more courteous employees at McDonald's.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Since it's a bit on the pricey side I've been waiting for a good reason to drop the coin without having to worry and celebrating a friends birthday is as good as any in my mind.We had a party of 4 food and wine lovers so I knew we would be able to order a nice smattering of food from across the menu to get a taste of everything Bin 14 has to eat and drink.To drink we first ordered the Ajello Grillo which was a crisp, acidic, mineral driven wine. I would highly recommend this wine if it's on the menu, great wine to enjoy with some of the lighter cheese options, and seafood small plates at the outdoor seating Bin 14 has out front or in their rear garden seating.  The second bottle we ordered was a lighter Italian red which was another great choice to pair with their pizzas, pastas and mezzi plates.  The wine was the best part of the evening.Overall the food was decent but not worth the prices they are charging.  We first ordered a smattering of cheeses for the table, the mozzarella with truffle honey and the La Quercia speck.  The cheeses were all very good and I pretty much love everything coming out of the farms of La Quercia in Iowa.  My only complaint is that for the amount they charge for the cheeses you should receive a little more.  When we finally got the attention of our waiter again we ordered round two which consisted of the spicy lamb sausage, pork belly, crispy polenta cakes and the heirloom tomato pizza. When the food finally arrived none of it really blew my mind. The sausage was a bit dry and the pork belly could have used more time to better render the fat. Our last round of ordering included beef tartare and tomato bruschetta, spinach pizza, two mezza entrees; mushroom risotto and the tagliatelle. It took forever for the food to come out and again, nothing was really outstanding.  I can tell you to stay away from any of the bruschetta (I've never been a fan, they aren't worth it and I didn't order them).  The pizza was so, so covered with spinach and ricotta.  I can say that the mushroom risotto was very good, creamy and earthy so I can recommend it.  The tagliatelle served with a meat ragu was decent, handmade pasta made the dish.On top of the food being just ""okay"", the service was lacking at best.  We tended to wait a long time in between courses.  Dirty plates were left on the table long after we were finished with them.  Water glasses were left empty for extended periods of time and re-filled only when requested.  We had to ask 3 different people to get more bread for the table when they did finally bring more bread they brought three small pieces.  Now does this make sense when we have a table of 4 and ordered a substantial amount of food? I hate when restaurants skimp of bread when you ask for it explicitly.  When we sat down we were each given one small plate to serve ourselves from the group plates, the plates were never changed between courses which was weird as well.  I don't feel like I am being hard on Bin 14 and their staff.  If you want to charge that much for food and wine I think those who are eating at your establishment should be able to expect a relatively high level of service, especially when your reservation has a time limit on it.  Yes, you heard me correctly; you have a two hour limit at your table.  No loitering here my friends.At the end of the day I was disappointed.  I'm glad I got a chance to try it but I won't be back any time soon.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Summary review:Great for date night, or small groups (3-6).  The food is generally fantastic, but the portions are mostly small, so the bill can add up quick.  Three dinner seatings Fri & Sat, so call for reservations.  Not great to walk into for dinner in general because it's pretty small & fills up fast.  If you're sharing with one other person, suggest ordering 1 dish from each: Small Plates/Pastas, Pizzas, and Entrees sections.  If you're hungry, add a salad or cheese/cured meat plate.Details:I'm going to start with the pizzas, because I love pizza.  I've had probably half of them.  My favorite so far has to be the spinach & ricotta.  I'm very excited for my next visit already, because I'm going to try the prosciutto di parma.  (Yes, fat kids can pre-select dinners for the next time they visit a restaurant!)  Also, the margherita & wild mushroom pizzas are great!  Added bonus, and very happy for me & my fiance, they offer all their pizzas on gluten free crust!!  Quick note however, this is where my ""generally fantastic"" comment first comes in.  GF pizza crust has the tendency to burn fast if you try to get the center of it as crisp as the edges.  Only happened once, but it was noticeable.  Note to Bin 14: One out of I don't remember how many pizza crusts burnt.  Not a bad batting average, but this is one note keeping you from 5 stars.As for the rest of the food, I can actually sum it up quickly.  It's all good, but note the portions are small.  So you really need to have multiple dishes.  The menu definitely is designed for this, so it's expected, but it really does add up fast.  For two people, I've not left for less than $115 or so.  (Note also, that's with several glasses of wine, so I kept them at a $$$ rating).  This is also the next (and last) place my ""generally fantastic"" note comes in.  A couple weeks ago we split the scallops for our entree.  Wow were we disappointed in the size...  Taste was amazing, but they were like the size of popcorn shrimp.  Similar last night, the lamb chops (small plate, to be fair).  We split these - which worked out because you get 2 - but it was probably 4 moderately sized bites.  I don't think throwing a third chop on there is going to break the bank on menu prices, and I think it would increase the value.  Lastly, I'll note the risotto.  Always good, and reasonably sized (when, of course, paired with a pizza)!Note to Bin 14: I don't know what it costs to run your restaurant, but if you can increase your portion sizes on a few of your entrees, it would do nothing but help your ratings.Service - awesome.  Very knowledgeable about the menu & the wine.  I know, this should be expected at a wine bar, but I've been disappointed on this front in the past.  Bin 14 servers know the food, and can pair the wines with it very well.  The sommelier, Kevin, is great.  Give him a price range a a couple adjectives to describe the taste you want, and he's got you covered.  Most of the staff is incredibly friendly, and takes the time to talk to you/help you with the menu.  They are attentive, and I don't recall seeing an empty glass (water or wine) ever.  Last note to Bin 14: Your staff is great, treat them well!Atmosphere is cool.  It can get loud, but usually not so bad you can't hear your table.  The crowd is cool, and a pretty stark difference from the downtown, college, party crowd.  Detailed review complete.  I'll go back, frequently.  And I recommend to anyone looking for a good foodie meal in Hoboken!",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

I finally got a chance to try it out on a late summer night this year. In the mood for a walk, we headed up and popped in on a Friday night (without reservations) to a small wait for seating. Between my boyfriend and myself, we ordered bruschetta, two small plates and two entrees. I preferred the apps to the entrees, however, found that everything presented to us was both flavorful and artfully presented. Combined with a bottle of wine, it was the perfect amount of food for me on a night out. That being said, had my boyfriend not had a bite to 'tide himself over' earlier, I'm sure we would have been stopping for pizza on the walk back. Even the pasta dishes were quite small. We slicked our plates and our bottle, happy with the experience (though the final bill seemed a bit steep for the AMOUNT of food we received.)As a side pet-peeve..

He was very helpful and patient while I grilled him about the reds they had in stock and pairing them with my food selections. Truffle fries - VERY tasty. we ordered 2 plates .. they went fast. Salty and Savory .. perfect with the full bodied red we selected. We also ordered the cheese platter, pizza and sweet bread. Cheese platter - decent portion and paired nicely with the wine.

The pastas looked good, as did the salads.  As far as the bruschettas go, please note that they are each two bites TOPS.  So if you're ordering that for dinner, as my friend E did, plan on trying at least four.I would definitely return for another weeknight dinner out with girlfriends or even just sit at the bar and have a nice glass of wine and pizza alone (ok that might make me sound like a loser, or a drunk, or both... whatever).",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

Sat at the bar, where the bartenders were extremely helpful, friendly, and honest about their wine and menu. Bin 14 is a wine bar first, but they do have beer and spirit selections. I actually started with a couple bottles of Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA. The beer selection is macro-craft; good beers from well known breweries from all over.Girlfriend and I split a 3 cheese platter and olives - the cheeses were served with an ample amount of bread, honey, and preserves which is not always found (sometimes at all). I really enjoyed the bleu cheese, my girlfriend the gouda.After that, I got the salmon entree - it was served with red potatoes (think homefries sized), leeks, and an unbelievablly flavorful and light vinaigrette. I told the bartender (we sat at the bar) that it was one of the best tasting salmon dishes I had ever tasted - he said that it was about the 5th time he had heard that on that very night. My girlfriend ordered a pizza with whole wheat crust, however it was not initially prepared in that manner. The bartender apologized profusely, and said he'd make sure he made it up to us. The correct order came out less than 10 minutes later, and when we finished our meals, he offered to buy us an after dinner drink. I had already purchased a nice glass of red wine, and said I'd stick to that - he made sure to fill me up (and then some). My girlfriend was treated to a tasting of some of wine specials and was filled up after deciding which she liked best. The food, drink, and customer service was top notch.Will absolutely return, many many times.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

I asked for a ""house"" (read: less expensive) Sauvignon blanc the other night and after a few sips, couldn't stomach the swill put before me. I noted that the color was off, but as I met my friends late and we planned to leave shortly after my arrival, I decided to wait for a decent glass of wine at our next stop. .   I was floored when I got the bill of $18! For that price I could have had a nice Sancerre in NYC!    Expressing my displeasure with the price, when I requested a ""house"" wine, an ""adjustment"" to $14 was made. I pointed out that the wine was ""off"" as it was dark, and cloudy, and frankly, undrinkable. i was told that it was a special organic wine. I didn't buy that. If I want ""organic"" wine, I'll go to the East Village! This is supposed to be an upscale wine bar for goodness sake.   The staff member ended up kindly writing off the bad wine, and my friends and I went on our way.      So sorry to see the demise of this once highly touted wine bar. Due to its location on the north end of town, my friends and I surmised that they are catering to the out-of-town folk driving in to Hoboken, so return local patrons are  not necessarily the clientele any longer.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

We picked 4 cheeses and we were excited with our choices...  (if I remember correctly it was about $18.00 for the 4 cheeses)   When our plate arrived my husband, my daughter and I just looked at each other in disbelief! It was 4 TINY little slivers of cheese....  I mean I could have eaten the ENTIRE 4 pieces alone... but OK... we weren't going to be difficult and we just chuckled and each ate our SMEAR of cheese... The were tasty but definitely NOT WORTH $18.00..... Next we decided to try the Bruschetta....  we picked 3 different ones because we couldn't decide which we preferred.     (side note THANK GOD we ordered three-- at least we each got ONE piece of bread!)  We ordered the Date & Bacon,  The beef tartare & I believe an olive tapenade.  AGAIN- the smallest portion Ive ever seen.... Tasty yes- but you have to order at least 2 orders  per person to even feel like you're actually EATING --  They should tell you its a BRUSCHETTA TASTING...

We shared the proscuitto and fig pizza which was delicious and my boyfriend couldn't stop eating my pulled pork in acorn squash.....it was cooked perfectly.  This is our second time here and I just love the idea of small plates so u can try a little of everything.  Our server was great as she had a great personality and helped recommend dishes. I also love the fact that when she poured my glass of torrontes straight from the bottle I was able to taste it first.  The only possible downside I could find is that instead of replacing our bowls for our mussel shells, the bowls were merely dumped and returned to our table.   Other than that, can't wait to come back here again. Total bill (before tip) for 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, endless mussels, a pizza, scallops and pulled pork was $100......we left very full!",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

416,DQduEHFqGQKVh5VXBrpf5w,Margaret C.,3.0 star rating,"I stopped in for a late lunch by myself on a weekday. The weekday lunch crowd is largely nannies/mommies and strollers, but not too busy. There was a screeching baby in the back, which was a little bothersome, but I enjoyed my lunch nonetheless. I like the vibe of the place, and the very busy server was polite and friendly, notably patient with a very pregnant couple who had a million questions about items on the menu (Is the cheese pasteurized? Oh, that's alcoholic? What is this? Is there sauce on the pizza?). The food was good, but I felt that it was slightly overpriced -- I guess it can do that when it seems to be one of the few nicer places in Hoboken. I would return to try dinner and some of the wines.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"

The food is good, though not mind blowing (Anthony and David, which i think is owned by the same owner, has way better food), and the place can be a bit crowded, but I still highly recommend it as a sophisticated place to go out for a good snack.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
419,M5DR7jPiZZW7aelXC03Cmg,Marco P.,2.0 star rating,"I'm  not sure why I'm not giving this one star, maybe I feel bad and the place seems like its trying real real hard. The food here is pretty much a joke. The ingredients and flavors seem harmonious, but the portions are ridiculous (seriously) and its carb heaven. $8 for a piece of bread with bean and garlic spread, please. The wines are mediocre, unimpressive lot, and are over priced. The crowd is ok, I like the fact they close the door when all the seats are full so that you aren't packed in like sardines, but I had hoped that the execution on this place would have been much better. Wonder what's going to replace it.",Bin 14,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian"
