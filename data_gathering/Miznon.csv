It was sooo good and I was so glad I tried it but sad I wouldn't be able to have it again for quite a while. When I found out they were opening a New York City location, I was thrilled! I finally made my way over and it exceeded my expectations.I ordered the lamb pita and it was SO GOOD. The pita was soft and fresh, the fixings inside were so tasty and I especially loved the sauce. I can't wait to come back and get it again.The location is really spacious especially for Chelsea Market with bleacher style seating on one wall, seats at the bar (where you can order from as well) and various tables inside and just outside the restaurant reserved for Miznon.If you're looking for a great lunch option in Chelsea Market I definitely recommend this spot.

The interior of the cauliflower was a tad cold, but I've never had cauliflower like this.

5,Pp_pTPFgIMENJ7yaNvjRVg,Jordan J.,5.0 star rating,"I absolutely LOVED Miznon! It was a meal where everything was spot on.First off, it has a pretty decent sized space, especially for Chelsea Market and I liked that a lot. The wait went by quickly enough too.We got the famous Baby Cauliflower which was just as tender and buttery as it looks in photos. It's a light dish and just falls apart at the touch of a fork. Super satisfying to eat.The Run Over Potato was really unique in its presentation and fun to eat as well. The sour cream was perfection with all the herbs in it, but the ratio of potato to cream was a bit unbalanced. Overall still delicious. We had to finish off with the pitas of course. The Rib Eye Roast Beef was a total home run. I loved the pita, which was thick and fluffy enough to absorb all the yummy sauces. The beef was crazy tender and well-seasoned, plus they were generous with amount they put in the pita. All the sauces were just delicious and having the veggies balanced out the rest of the flavors and textures. We left pretty darn stuffed thanks to the portion sizes and every dish was truly on point. I will definitely be back to grab a quick bite or to have a multi-course meal because you can totally do either here!",Miznon,4.0 star rating,$$,Mediterranean
6,MChIIjb0nzgF1WRgmTWStQ,Manna C.,3.0 star rating,"The food was at Miznon was just average. Disappointed by this fact since it's a chain from Tel Aviv and by a well known executive chef. I ordered the ribeye minute steak and the world famous baby cauliflower. Ribeye minute steak comes in a pita with the steak, tomato salsa, pickles and tahini sauce. The pita was really soft but not warm and really took away from the experience. Miznon likes to pack the front of the pita but the bottom was completely empty - there would have been nothing in there if I didnt push the meat down.  So I just had mouthfuls of pita. The baby cauliflower was also subpar, which was a let down because it was charred beautifully. I also tried the intimate cow and I was not a fan. The meat was tender and had a kick to it due to the peppers. Again, pita wasn't warm. In addition, I also tried the run over potato - it was so run over I thought the server was handing me an empty tray. It didn't have too much flavor but very amusing to eat.

I was taking a break from red meat, so ended up ordering a cauliflower pita. Now I'm not the biggest fan of vegetarian food, but this thing was delicious. Great combination of flavors. And the pita was so soft and tasty. My friends had ordered a lamb pita, and a cheeseburger pita, and both they had very positive things to say. We also ordered for the table:-cauliflower appetizer: this was delicious. Well seasoned-run over potato: DO NOT ORDER THIS. This dish is the reason that I only am giving 4 stars instead of 5. It's a really minuscule amount of potato (which is already a cheap ingredient) with some sauce for $6. Major rip off, and didn't even taste that great. We got there early (11:45 on a weekday) and there were plenty of seats available then. However it did get crowded and there were people stalking tables towards the end.

Staff is totally out to lunch. I was hungry. I waited 25 minutes in line for a customer to ask about every god damn item on the menu. I was only three back in line. Wasn't packed like normal. While multiple staff members just stood there and chatted with each other - not opening the other cash register to get other orders in. They did nothing. They could have opened another cash register. Then two tall guys walked in and stood in front of the counter and the staff did nothing to imply there was a line - but began to take their order before me - with the other cash register. I flipped my lid. I had enough. And walked out with a bang of a menu on the counter. The staff guy knew he messed up. But he didn't do anything to rectify the situation. So, this place is not even a one star. It's overrated. And frankly filled with a bunch of customers and staff that are in their own world. I'm a New Yorker. My friends that have been here say it's not worth the wait - and certainly not worth going out of your way to eat here. Maybe if, and only if, the line has zero people waiting AND you aren't in a rush for some mediocre food. I realized that I didn't have time for this Shish !!",Miznon,4.0 star rating,$$,Mediterranean

Between me and a friend, we shared a cauliflower and I got the avo/egg salad pita. The cauliflower is a hugeeee beautiful burnt, salty cauliflower and it has the perfect taste of singed saltiness/juiciness. I loveeeeee the cauliflower and always get it. The avo/egg salad howeverrrrrrr I didn't like much... it was literally 75% tart, tasteless avocado with a lotttttt of egg. It just wasn't unique and didn't get me excited. It felt like random flavors smushed together... I was not into it. I would definitely recommend trying the meat options over the vegetarian options if you're not a veggie.

48,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,4.0 star rating,"I've read about Miznon in an article about new places opening in NYC. Considering that I: A) am Israeli and try to check out Israeli places whenever I can B) Love Chelsea Market and will make any excuse to come here and C) consider Mediterranean food to be my favorite cuisine and eat Hoomoos pretty much every day, I've decided to give this place a try.Just like mentioned in previous reviews, there was a line but it really wasn't bad in our case and moved just quickly enough for us to make up our minds on what we wanted to get.I got Lavan C.Flowers in a Pita (cauliflower, tahini, scallions) while my cousin got Wild Mushrooms (a whole forest burned on a hot steel, scallions, sour cream). With each order you get a number which you place wherever you are sitting, and they bring your order to you. There are a decent amount of tables here, as opposed to most stands in Chelsea Market, yet most were occupied. We took the one available table and waited. Since I was told I could use any name for my order, I used my Israeli one (Irit) and the waiter who brought out my order spoke in Hebrew to me. It was a nice touch and from a quick assessment I'd say maybe close to half the employees spoke Hebrew.As to the food itself, my dish was quite delicious. In  general I think cauliflower is alright but the combination of flavors together with a soft and fluffy pita (the way it is supposed to be in my opinion) worked very well. My cousin liked her dish but didn't seem to be as impressed as I was.It is a bit on the pricey side and I felt like a pita wouldn't fill you up if you wanted a full meal. yet this place is definitely worth checking out. Bonus points given to seeing Eyal Shani work his magic in the kitchen.",Miznon,4.0 star rating,$$,Mediterranean

Like walking into a secret portal that takes you straight to tel aviv. Bombarded with delicious smells and trays of beautiful food being served to excited happy customers all around. Middle eastern musical favorites boom over the speakers! Service: spot on. Fast, friendly and on the dot.Food: ingredients were AMAZING. Composition was FANTASTIC (no surprises there- eyal shani can really do alot with a little!). Only reason i gave 3 stars:The portion was lacking in size. For 14$, you expect to get a pita jam packed with meat etc. It was about half full. As well- sandwich on menu said ""served with a tomato ""burger""""- a big ass slice of tomato- mine came with chopped up tomato. Small detail- but still. Lastly- we ordered sweet potato- 6$- the order apparently comes with ONE (perfectly roasted DELICIOUS) sweet potato. Sort of ridiculous even by NYC standards.Lastly- at his other locations world wide- tahini and hot sauce are readily available to customers in larger vats to self serve. Not the case here as I'm sure it's against NYC health code. You have to request it upon ordering. Not a big deal. Hopefully next time the portions willBe a bit more generous, and maybe they throw in an extra tater for your 6$... and seeing its their first week open- they're doing a great job.

As we were trying to walk in, we were rudely approached by a guy bussing tables and were told that they were closed.  I couldn't quit understand the reason but I think he said it was because they were running out of food. My husband went in anyway to read the menu and the same guy was giving my husband dirty looks and tailing him. The restaurant was supposed to open until 9 PM.

61,S8TrytdRsF-6ovqGQEWnpQ,Xiyin T.,2.0 star rating,"Came here this past Saturday night and had the minute steak pita and the beef stew pita. Hands down best pita I've ever had, better than Dizengoff next door(ish). It was fluffy and pillowy with a chewy exterior but none of the bitterness associated with a more charred pita (like Dizengoff, which also makes a fine pita). The minute steak especially was incredible -- it was tender and flavorful, served with an amazing green hot sauce and a massive charred pepper to boot. I'm already salivating thinking about it. Music was good; ample seating. It would have easily been a 5 star experience if not for the insanely surly service. The way these servers were acting made it seem like they were paying me to be there, versus me paying them 13/14 bucks for a small pita sandwich (you really can't make a dinner out of one), plus tip. What I'm about to retell is the most bizarre experience I've ever had involving a soft drink and should be read with the Beyoncé album Lemonade playing in the background.At the cash wrap I was specifically asked if I wanted a drink. I asked if they had lemonade and the cashier said Yes, it's fresh squeezed, but off menu, but amazing, and I'll charge you for a Stella. So with tip, two pita sandwiches and a soft drink totaled 44 bucks. Ok. Sandwiches are brought to my table after about 10 min and I ask about the drink and she says I have to go pick it up at the bar and she can't bring it to me. I go to the bar and a female bartender with short blonde hair glares at me and says, 'We don't have lemonade, I have to make it by hand' and then walks away. Ok? First of all, your cashier sold me a lemonade--in fact, UPSOLD me one, because I would have been happy with my 30 dollar fast casual meal minus the extra 14 bucks for your amazing off menu hand squeezed lemonade that rivals the price of a cocktail at Paul's Casablanca--did I somehow accidentally bring ill upon your entire family? Secondly, you're a bartender at a full service bar. Presumably you have simple syrup and a handheld juicer for mixed drinks and if you don't have the latter why don't you sell one more 15 dollar sandwich to invest in one. Third of all, if your job description as a bartender isn't to squeeze and mix stuff, what is it? Did I miss the memo and when you woke up this morning did you intend to come to work thinking it would be a day of prancing in the sun while eating bon bons? Finally, if you don't intend to make my 14 dollar lemonade of which 3 bucks was your tip for slicing open a few lemons and diluting with water and sugar, how about a refund instead of glaring and walking away? I'm happy to spend 5 bucks next door for the same exact thing.But I swallow my complaints and I wait. I waited 15 more minutes at which point we'd eaten both sandwiches and at which point 25-30 min had passed with no lemonade. Now we are leaving and now despite the amazing sandwich I have an awful taste in my mouth. We see same blonde bartender angrily making two lemonades (I mean it, never before have I seen more vitriol from a woman plucking lemons with her bare hands out of a cocktail shaker...and I once hand squeezed 40 lemons for my best friend's birthday lemonade punch, gratis) and those lemonades sailing past us on a tray (wait, what's this about not being able to bring the lemonade to my table?!). We ask if it's ours and server just smirks and says, Uh, no, and keeps walking. Blonde girl sees me waiting and passively aggressively within earshot of me declares to seemingly no one but her very own unhappy self, No more lemonades!! And then stalks away. I wait around another 5 min (ignored) before finally asking for a refund for this 14 dollar white elephant. Took another 10 min to get a refund on just the lemonade. Walked around the corner and got a FRESH SQUEEZED MINT one at Dizengoff for 5 bucks and the server smiled at me and I didn't feel like s for no reason anymore, after all.",Miznon,4.0 star rating,$$,Mediterranean

My experience here wasn't that great, but I'm letting it slide since it is a relatively new establishment. Went on a Friday night, and they were extremely busy, almost in over their own heads. Taking orders at a brisk pace, which is fine when it is that busy. Once my order was taken, the food took 50 minutes to come out. When my order came out, they made it a point to tell me that the other thing we ordered was no longer available. Strange to wait 50 minutes to tell me that, but you can tell they haven't really gotten a handle on how to handle certain things yet. They accommodated us nicely with another choice off the menu no extra charge, which was brought out right away. The food was very good, but was kind of lukewarm, expecting fresh food after almost an hour wait is a fair expectation.
