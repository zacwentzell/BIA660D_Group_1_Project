Yay for another outstanding Taiwanese place!If I weren't on a diet, i'd probably be here all the time...but because of that, I hadn't been in a while. To my surprise, the place had expanded!

Unfortunately, I still don't think they have enough seating, even with all the counter seats facing the kitchen now. With better planning, there could totally be ample counter standing space for everyone (tbh I would still totally squat for VFN noodles though...)! There's some window ""seats"" that aren't really ideal for eating because you'd either have to squat, or hold these hot bowls of noodles in your laps. If you loop around the exit though, there is now a small area of tables/seats you can use.Lines are long and unfortunately they don't move THAT fast, but strangely enough, after you place your order, it doesn't actually take them that long to get your order out. Everything is made to order, so your noodles are guaranteed to be fresh and hot!This wasn't my first time there, but it sure was my first time seeing and trying the dan dan noodles $11.94, and man, it was definitely the best dan dan noodles I've had in the US (obviously can't compare to Taiwan!)!!! The noodles had the best texture, perfectly cooked and chewy (QQ as we would say!), everything was seasoned perfectly, there was a generous amount of fried fava beans and ground pork in it, and the spice was JUST RIGHT, even though they do warn you it's pretty spicy/no modifications! Those deep fried fava beans were EVERYTHING, loved having a bit of crunch in every bite. The noodles are a thinner noodle, and not the handpulled flat noodles like in the other dishes. If you've never had this before, FYI this is a dry noodle!We always order the beef noodle soup $12.86 there, and as always, it was delicious. The beef is always really tender, and noodles are always perfectly cooked. I kinda wish their noodles were a bit more red, like the 紅燒 versions in Taiwan, or perhaps have one that is tomato based!Seems like they also now serve bubble tea, but I'm not sure how good it is...milk tea seems premade so not 100% sure if you can adjust the sweetness, etc.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

There are literally only four items on their menu but thats not a bad decision since they're good at what they focus on. I ordered the tingly cumin lamb noodles dry (not in soup) while my friend ordered the taiwanese beef noodle soup. Both had their strong points and different qualities depending on what you want. For the tingly cumin lamb noodles, the lamb was thin but tasty and the noodles were al dente and extremely flavorful. If you think its lacking flavor, then start eating the noodles from the bottom of the bowl - definitely more tingly there. The taiwanese beef noodle soup had an amazing broth and I couldn't stop drinking it. The beef was super tender and moist. But the noodles had less flavor than the ones in the lamb noodles.

It was literally melt in your mouth with a bit of fat, not too stringy or tough and they give you a good amount.  There are some bok choy to help with all the heavier items as well.  The flavor of the soup is SLIGHTLY different than other places I've been to but in a good way, very flavorful.Overall, highly recommend this if you come to Chelsea market.

There are literally only four items on their menu but thats not a bad decision since they're good at what they focus on. I ordered the tingly cumin lamb noodles dry (not in soup) while my friend ordered the taiwanese beef noodle soup. Both had their strong points and different qualities depending on what you want. For the tingly cumin lamb noodles, the lamb was thin but tasty and the noodles were al dente and extremely flavorful. If you think its lacking flavor, then start eating the noodles from the bottom of the bowl - definitely more tingly there. The taiwanese beef noodle soup had an amazing broth and I couldn't stop drinking it. The beef was super tender and moist. But the noodles had less flavor than the ones in the lamb noodles.

It was literally melt in your mouth with a bit of fat, not too stringy or tough and they give you a good amount.  There are some bok choy to help with all the heavier items as well.  The flavor of the soup is SLIGHTLY different than other places I've been to but in a good way, very flavorful.Overall, highly recommend this if you come to Chelsea market.

The beef is so tender and soft, the meat basically melted in my mouth. Not at all fatty. - Tingly Cumin Lamb = The lamb was also very good. A bit more tough than the beef but that's normal.

They all sounded good, but we went straight for the ""very spicy dan dan mian"" because we love trying dan dan mian all over the city. Even though it was in the name, they warned us again when ordering that it would be very spicy. I figured there would be a good amount of spice, but they weren't kidding. That was probably the spiciest dan dan mian I've ever had. If you can take the spice though, it was delicious.All the noodles are, as their name says, made fresh, and you can watch them making them through the window that lines the standing counter where you can eat your noodles. The freshness shows in the texture of the noodles, as they had just the right amount of chewiness. It was a little expensive at $12 for one bowl, but there was a plentiful amount of pork, cucumber, scallions, fried broad beans (something you don't see in all dan dan mian), and spices to go along with the noodles. I would get that again, although I'd like to try the other options on the menu first, especially the cumin lamb noodles.As for where in the market they're located, they're right by one of the entrances on 15th Street, so if you're heading straight there for some noodles, save yourself from the ridiculous crowds and traffic in the rest of the market and just go in straight from the street.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

Super sauce-y with a good amount of aromatic spices to really drench the noodles in, plus lots and lots of lamb! The kitchen is VERY generous with the meat! I did wish that the sauce was spicier to add an extra level of yummy dimension to the noodles. But otherwise, it was quite tasty.I've eaten a LOT of noodles from Xi'An Famous Foods, and I think the greatest contrast is the spice level.

It's tucked nicely in the corner, but you can't miss it because their smells fill the area up. When I went on a weekend, there was a line and it took about 20 minutes to get my food. While you wait, you can also see the chefs work their magic in the windows. You can see the live the making of the noodles made in front of your very eyes. (It really is very fresh). FOOD: When I went around 12 PM, they had already run out of the lamb noodles. Instead, I went for the vegan noodles with broth ($13). The broth soup consists of noodles, imitation meat, and tons of vegetables. The broth, even though vegan, was super rich and flavorful. You could taste how fresh the noodles were. The unique thing about the dish is the use of the noodle making technique. The soup contains a single thick noodle that was continually kneaded. SERVICE: Once you finish ordering, you can wait on the side for your food. They systemically write your number on the bowl and fill the orders. It took about 15 minutes to actually get my food once I ordered. You can wait agonizingly on the side as they call your name. Even though there was a 20 minute wait in total, they worked so fast and efficiently for the number of orders they were receiving. ATMOSPHERE: Since this is a booth, I had to find my own seating in Chelsea Market. It can get very crowded and tourist filled since its right next to the high line. I took my food outside and actually found a small park to eat my food at since the weather was so nice. They even had plenty of tables and chairs. (14th Street Park, it's right outside Chelsea Market). OVERALL: I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area.

I've wanted to try Very Fresh Noodles for a while, but my treks to Chelsea Market are almost always during peak hours, so I'm spending more time there navigating through tourists taking photos, causing me to say, ""Nuts to this! I'm just going to go to Los Tacos No.1 and getting the F out of here!"" On a Monday evening around 7, my friends and I ended up here after deciding to give a local restaurant another try after a sub-par first visit spurred an invite from their management team; see my two-star review from 2/5/2018, haaa. Long story very short, we ended up leaving there before ordering and needed some comfort food to soothe our hanger. One friend wanted noodles, and Very Fresh Noodles popped into her head. IT SAVED US.The menu is small, but it sure makes it easy to choose! I certainly don't say that punitively. Plus, once La Mei Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup caught me eye, so how could I say I wanted to eat somewhere else? Ha! Along with that soup (spicy or mild options available), Tingly Cumin Beef and Lamb noodle options were on the menu, along with a vegan noodle dish with mock duck, mushrooms, and bok choy. While I can not say that I tried my friends' spicier dishes - me and spice are NOT best friends - I can certainly speak to the rich comfort that the mild Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup provided me. The ample cilantro and green onions sprinkled on top occasionally cleansed my palate as I worked through the rich red broth, melt - in - your - mouth beef shanks, and garlicky mustard greens. For those totally adverse to spice, be warned: even the mild has the tiniest kick to it. Your nose may get a little runny, but it's absolutely worth it. As for my friends' spicy dishes, their bowls were polished pretty clean after consumption, so I think I can very safely attest that everything at Very Fresh Noodles is delectable. A good soup always wins, no matter what its country of origin. A lot of comfort comes from doughy hand-pulled Biangbiang noodles and a rich broth.

It takes several bites to reach the end and are a bit of a hazard to slurp as their large surface area sprays soupy goodness everywhere. The veggies in the soup are a great crunchy fresh complement to the rich soup and chewy noodles. The beef was incredibly tender and flavorful, truly unique to this style of noodle soup.

It started out ok but about halfway through it was just too much to handle. I could have done without the fake duck too--it had a weird texture, more similar to wet cardboard than meat. Honestly I'd have been happier with some tofu, not sure what the deal is with the imitation meat. I would probably recommend the dry noodles, though I can't say for sure without actually trying them myself. The whole operation surely is a fun sight with the chef hand-pulling and tearing fat noodles way in the back, so the all glass kitchen definitely scores some style points.

It was much less spicy than the noodles at Xian famous foods (the obvious comparison I guess, though those aren't exactly authentic - Xian's noodles are also thinner) but overall it was still fine. It was quite busy and we waited about ten minutes for our order. The guy taking orders was super personable and friendly - I was very impressed. The highlight of this experience was probably when someone asked if they had gluten free options and he responded ""no, we love our gluten here."" A close second was when a kid asked if they had just noodles with nothing else added and he replied ""no, that wouldn't taste very good.""Previously (well over a year) ago I'd been here once gotten the vegan duck one and I have a vague recollection of it being too salty and/or oily and not wanting to get it again, but I liked the noodles and remember them being better on my first visit.

It's a stand that's constantly buzzing with people around, trying to watch the noodz get stretched, smacked, pulled, and cooked before ending up perfectly QQ in your bowl of delicious soup. FOOD: Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup - I personally love a good bowl of hearty beef noodle soup, but it's hard to find it done right. The noodles aren't QQ enough or the broth isn't thick and flavorful enough or the beef isn't tender and chewy. However, this bowl of beef noodle soup is made just about perfectly. The bowl will set you back $14, but it's actually way more filling and hearty than it seems. The long wide noodle is literally never ending as you start on your bowl of soup, which is good because it's so fresh and a good consistency. The spicy version of the soup definitely has a good kick to it, so be prepared with some water. It also has a rich flavor of beef and spice and everything good in the world. I was most surprised about the beef because it was so tender and juicy and there was a lot of it compared to many other bowls of beef noodle soup I've had.TLDR: come here for some delicious soup with amazing noodles and lots of super tender beef chunks. it's definitely worth the $14 because you'll be full for many many hours after.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

This was definitively one of the very best (and very freshest) meals that I had on my most recent trip to New York City.During my first visit to Chelsea Market, I was deeply embroiled in an internal battle as to where I would eat for lunch. Genuinely one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, as I was surrounded on all sides by the sights & smells of some of the most delectably unique restaurants I've ever seen in a market setting. I ended up standing in line for ""Very Fresh Noodles"" as I was extremely curious in Western Chinese cuisine, something that I'd never tasted before. I opted for the Tingly Cumin Lamb Noodles (dry). As the man behind the counter began pulling the fresh noodles by hand, I knew I had made the right decision.Honestly, I've never tasted anything like this dish in my entire life. Sure, there are flavors that are familiar, but the way they complemented & contrasted with the fresh noodles, sauces, and vegetables was altogether extremely new to me.

I was actually incredibly impressed at how accurate the title of this place is in terms of the freshness of their noodles and how flavorful their broth and beef were. Definitely one of my favorite foods I ate in NY and I'm surprised this place doesn't have more and better reviews as it deserves.It's easy to pass this spot because it's not directly on the main walkway within Chelsea Market. It's more hidden on a random turn filled with other little restaurants and this is actually more of a food cart, so be aware and don't surpass this gem!! During our trip, we got the ""la mei taiwanese beef noodle soup"", which consists of hand-pulled noodles in beef soup with soft slow-braised beef, pickled greens, scallions, cilantro, and some chili oil. It was super cool because you can see the person literally stretching the noodles out and making them out of scratch. It was entertaining and just reassured me that these noodles are indeed very fresh. The noodles were soft, a lil' chewy, more on the thick side, and DELICIOUS all combined. Seriously, the slow-braised beef basically melts in your mouth and they give you a ton of it within the soup. The soup itself is more thick too and a bit oily, but sooooo delicious and hearty. Within this area, there's not a lot of seating opportunities, but we found some random high table to stand at to eat these noodles. Honestly though, this noodle soup is SO good, I wouldn't even care where I eat them... cause consuming them would just block out everything else. At that point, it's just me and the noodles... me being completely mesmerized. In addition to the great food, the dude at the cashier was extremely cool, accommodating, and definitely wanted us to have the best experience.

I was armed with all the right weaponry: chopsticks, a spoon, and the remnants of my dignity.I don't usually protest a good noodle, let alone of the fresh and hand-pulled variety but like to steer clear of Chelsea Market all other tourist traps. My friend raved about this place so I had no choice but to check it out. Who am I to feel like above a little public noodling? Also, the words ""Chelsea Market"" were never specifically used to describe the location of said noodle joint so in a way I was catfished.

147,J91Z-EF0G8n8rSj4EJKqqw,Asuka N.,5.0 star rating,"Very Fresh Noodles is a relatively new addition to Chelsea Market; it is located in the back of the area across from The Lobster Place that has a potpourri of different small shops. Because it resembles more of a pop-up as opposed to a full store, the menu here isn't all that extensive - just 3 items, one of which is a vegan one (i.e. did not read any further) and two meat dishes. Both looked delicious, but we opted for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup (spiciness set to mild) over the cumin lamb dish, which from the looks of it seemed like it could bring a decent amount of heat. The line to order was not that long, but we probably did have to stand around for about 10 minutes or so before our noodle soup was done. In the interim, you can park yourself on the ledge or watch the noodles get slapped and hand-pulled.There's nothing bad to say about the finished product, in my mind: the beef brisket is plentiful, and the broth still packs a bit of a punch but without bringing to mind the heat you would find in Szechuan dishes. The real star though are the noodles themselves - they seem fresher and are quite a bit more chewy and gelatinous than I have had elsewhere. This seems to aid in retaining more of the flavor of the broth in the noodles. It is fantastically-executed, and although it is undoubtedly more expensive than you would encounter for the same over in Taiwan, the version here is done very, very well. This is not the be-all, end-all for Chinese / Taiwanese cuisine by far, but if you are looking for a quick noodle dish that will have high-quality noodles and a zesty flavor, Very Fresh Noodles is a winner in my book.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

Sure, there's no seating close by, but watching as noodles are crafted from dough to finished product is a great way to burn time before digging into your beef or lamb dish. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Very Fresh Noodles are also Very Expensive Noodles, and it'll run you $13.00 for a beef or lamb cumin bowl. That's not unreasonable given what ramen goes for these days, but it's worth pointing out. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?So here's my dilemma. The noodles themselves at Very Fresh Noodles were excellent, with a great pillowy consistency and a chew that had me enjoying every bite. I would have loved these in virtually any other setting, but the beef and associated oils and greases that came with the brisket took away from the experience a bit. For starters, the brisket was on a next level of fattiness, and the pockets of fatty slime that made their way into my bowl were just a bit off-putting even for someone like me who typically eats that stuff right up. Additionally, while I ordered a dry bowl versus a soup, there was a full couple of centimeters of oil in the bottom of my bowl which, while flavorful, took away from the quality of the noodle and the flavor of the brisket. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?I'll be back to Very Fresh Noodles, but with the hope that they can tone it down a bit with respect to the oils in their dishes.

Someone takes the dough that was prepared earlier that day and stretches it out to create these long and yummy hand-pulled noodles. They then cook the noodles and add it to a soup or keep them dry (relatively dry since there's still a good amount of sauce on them). I got the traditional beef soup (can't remember the exact name) but it was so flavorful and aromatic. There were so many chunks of tender beef in my soup that two people could've eaten from it. I definitely want to go back to try the tingly lamb noodles dry since I've heard great reviews about it. The only issues you might run into is waiting in a super long line and finding seating. I passed by at around peak lunch time (anywhere from 12-1:30/2) and decided to come back later since there was no space. They don't actually have any seating since they're a stall inside of Chelsea Market. There are some small tables with chairs to the right of the stall (past the glass doors) , but there are only a few and they are definitely taken up by patrons from other food stalls (it's located in the most heavily congested food area in Chelsea Market). I would recommend going either before the lunch rush or after since it's a bit difficult to walk around with a hot bowl of soup and people swarming all around you trying to get their food for the day.

Very Fresh Noodles opened earlier this year, and I suspect it will become a big tourist attraction, if it isn't one already. Located at the main(? Not the entrance across from Google) entrance of the Chelsea market, it's a kiosk with a guy hand-making the noodles right in front of you. The freshest noodles possible! The whole kiosk is surrounded in an aura of aromatic spices. I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodles and am already craving more. It has flavors of Szechuan pepper and star anise, two of my favorite spices. The flavors are intense without being overwhelmingly salty or spicy. Just very flavorful. The noodles remind me of drunken noodles--wide and flat. Only, unlike drunken noodles, they're also very long. They also have vegan noodles. The noodles are flour, and are not gluten free. They have a third cumin-centric noodle that you can get with beef or lamb. The beef was so tender! For my fellow Korean food lovers, it reminded me of the beef you find in  (yukgaejang), but even more tender. I don't even really like vegetables but the bok Choy and small slices of celery really soaked up the broth well. I stood in line for maybe 5 minutes (went on a Sunday around 3) but it took a half hour for the noodles to actually come out. In the meantime, I explored the rest of the market. I really like the Baskets store, as well as spices & tease. There isn't any seating in the immediate vicinity, but venture further into the market and you'll come across a hallway with some tables and chairs.

The person taking my order was probably very tired as he got my order wrong even after I tried telling him what I wanted 2-3 times. He was scrambling to take my order and pack up other people's food at the same time. He was helpful though as he helped me choose the dish I should order. The lamb ran out the day I came, it was close to 9 PM (closing time) so I guess that's why. This probably means lamb is more popular than beef. The noodles are made right at the spot, you can see the dude slamming the dough on the table and pulling it into strings. I ordered the biang biang beef noodles and it was quite good. I don't know if the noodles were a little too soft and soggy because I left it in the bag for a while before I ate, or it was just like that. The noodles just lack the texture that authentic Chinese noodles have. The sauce compliments the dish well, they didn't give too much of it (or perhaps it was soaked up by the noodles). It's not too spicy, so don't be worried by it - and I am the type of person that can't take any spice at all. The beef was amazing, though. They were super soft and tender and very juicy. I would've given this place a 4 star if it wasn't too pricy and if the noodles were a bit better.

Fast forward six months and I suggest to my fiancé to come here and try a bowl of these noodles, he happily complied. We came here this past Tuesday night around 6:30 pm and Chelsea Market was quite empty at the time.  It was probably due to people heading out of town early for Thanksgiving, or working late so they could do the same the following day. Very Fresh Noodles is located closer to the 10th Avenue entrance and since we entered from 9th Avenue, it took us a bit to get there (although that resulted in us getting some delicious halva from another stand).There were several people eating by the stand when we got there and a few people looking at the menu. I got the the vegan noodles with mock duck, bok choy and shiitake mushrooms (dry and spicy), while the fiancé got the tingly cumin lamb in a soup (mild). Since there was almost no wait, both dishes were ready in about five minutes I definitely enjoyed my dish, the noodles were very fresh as promised and the sauce they were in was delicious. I've never had duck so can't compare the mock duck to anything, yet it tasted very meat-like, to the point where I was worrying that I was eating actual meat. It was very good nonetheless and the combination of celery and bok choy contributed to the flavor. The fiancé really enjoyed his dish and we were both quite full after finishing it.Perhaps it was because I came here with very high expectations or that I had noodles made in a very similar fashion from another place , which I happened to enjoy more, but I was not blown away by this place.

The weather was absolutely gorgeous and Very Fresh Noodles had been on my list for a while, so I figured it'd be a great Chelsea Market / High Line outing. When we arrived, the line was a bit long, about 10 people in, and while the line moved very consistently, it took a bit of time before we placed our order.Given the wait, I'm not surprised it took a while for us to get our food, but over 20 minutes to pull and boil some noodles and put them into some broth? Way too long. Luckily it gave us enough time to scout out tables and secure a seat to slurp the goodies.We went with the beef noodle soup, dry cumin lamb noodles, and the cucumber salad. First off, the noodles were actually pretty good. The QQ texture and portion size were spot on. However, the flavors were just off. The beef noodle soup was unlike any beef noodle soup I've had. Star anise is in my opinion critical to beef noodle soup and theirs almost tasted like a mushroom broth versus anything with actual meat. The pieces of beef were also a bit dry for a stewed soup, and I think my disappointment in the flavor overwhelmed any other opinion. The dry cumin lamb noodles were just okay. The flavors weren't strong, and I'm comparing it to Xi'an Famous Foods and theirs just didn't compare. Lastly, the cucumber salad was not memorable. Maybe I'm just used to XFF, but again, the cucumber salad there is way superior.Given the location, lack of seating, wait, off flavors, and higher prices, I'm passing next time I find myself at Chelsea Market.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

I rolled up hotboy on the blocc and went to try my first ""very fresh noodle."" I ordered the soup and asked for extra spicy, I wanted to try the very spicy dandan but was in the mood for some soup. The wait was not too long, and the god like papi handed me my bowl with white light shining down from the heavens. I posted up at a table and took my first sip of the soup. The soup had that deep, extremely well developed flavor that is lacking in many, many soups and stews. From this moment on, I knew I was going to be quaking by the end of it all. Next up, I peeped all the beef lurking in my bowl. It was falling apart due to being so, so tender, like a young calf frolicking in a hot tub of soicy beef stew. I picked up a piece of this sexy beef, and I shook. The tender beef MELTED - in my mouth. The flavor was also so deep and developed, I almost shed a tear. The very spicy was spicy, but not like too spicy to the point where you don't enjoy it. I then sunk my chompers into the fat noodle. The noodle was perfectly al dente, silky, firm, soft, flavored...PERFECT. THE DISH WAS PERFECT. I became perfect. The choy was perfect, the scallions were perfect, the celery and random other ingredients were perfect. I shed two tears - one from the spice creeping up on me and the other from feeling so perfect and elated. I will DEFINITELY be back for this gorgeous dihh, along with their highly praised new 10/10 spicy dandan I have yet to try. This place makes my top shotta nah miss spots.

Last week I stayed at a hotel in mid-town and didn't make our way down this area, was very bummed! I'm 100% Taiwanese with family from northern china (山東）where they were known to be consuming lots dough (noodles, dumpling etc). I grew up eating a lot of authentic hand made / cut noodle in Taiwan and hardly ever met the match when I came to the US later on. I took the food elsewhere to eat as there were plenty of seatings everywhere at Chelsea market. I found a little corner and set my food down to worship with my camera first and sip the bliss of its presence. The first bite I took after mixing it up, literally brought me to tears. I tried taking my time to enjoy each bite but it was impossibly addictive! so I ended up ordering another one to go eat later at hotel, just so I won't leave with regrets XDTotally worth the 6 hour flight here today and 7 hour flight back home tomorrow!

The cucumbers were spicy with a kind of sweetness to it. The only draw back is the location as it is inside the Chelsea Market, which is packed with tourists and it can be a bit stressful trying to find a table. The other thing I would say is that you definitely want to eat it there and not take it to go.

However, my friends insisted that this place is the bomb, and so I got dragged into grabbing food here. And it turned out to be surprisingly good (thanks friends!).Very Fresh Noodles is a noodle shop that's tucked into the corner of Chelsea market, amongst the myriad of other food options in the building. It's not that hard to find though, given that it's one of the places with the longest lines there. And there's a good reason for the line.The noodles were extremely tasty (and chewy, cause they hand-make them there). The spices were great - just enough to hit the spot, but not overboard. I'd say it's noticeable better than its competitor, Xian Famous Foods, but you will have to suffer through a long line and higher prices for the quality.The portions are a bit small, especially given the price, but the taste more than made up for it. After ordering your food, you usually still need to wait 20 min before you get it. So if you do end up coming here, be prepared to spend some extra time enjoying your people/tourist watching in the Chelsea market.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

Much better than Berlin Currywurst which also newly opened at Chelsea Market. I had high expectations for that and was somewhat disappointed.The first time I tried this place, I came with a group at night. I got the Tingly Cumin Beef (Dry) because they were out of lamb. The cumin flavor was delicious and I loved how much pickled mustard greens they put in the noodles. The beef was tender, but they use shredded beef instead of chunks. The Tingly Cumin Beef tastes better dry than in soup. I tasted my friend's soup version and it did nothing for the noodles except make it too soft. I got a taste of my friend's Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup and wow, it was actually really good. It was a bit redder and oilier than regular Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but the flavor was spot on. Some place make it too sweet, but their version was nice and spicy. I also love how much pickled mustard greens they put into this as well. It really makes it taste so much better.Instead of chunks of beef, all the noodles used shredded beef. We weren't sure if it was because the beef stewed so long (since we came at night) that it fell apart or they did it on purpose. I came back during lunch another day to see and it was also shredded beef. For lunch I got the mild version, which still has a decent kick to it. For some reason, the soup base didn't taste as good as the first time I had it. It was less beefy and more just spicy. I would have liked some nice chunks of beef shank instead, as Taiwanese beef noodle soup is supposed to have.It's cool that they pull the noodles for every order. You get a show along with your food. It didn't take too long either. The noodles are way too thick and doughy though. It's fine if you eat it dry, but when sitting in the soup for a while, they get pretty unappetizing.It's only their soft opening now. I wish they were able to have their full menu before my last day of class, since they supposedly had on the menu something called a broke college student combo.

Conversely, I also came to Very Fresh Noodles with very low expectations, but was still curious to see if the quality and taste could at least compel me to make a return trip. The stand is located way in the back corner of the clustered section of Chelsea Market, and it's easy to miss on your first go. There's no seating, although you can probably loiter around the neighboring windowsill.The broth of the beef noodle soup was pretty flavorful, although a little too greasy for my tastes. There's not really any nuance to the addition of chili oil, and they're a little too generous with it during preparation. The noodles are freshly pulled, and while I typically like my noodles this way, the pulls are very uneven, resulting in some really, really overly dense chews. There just needs to be a little more uniformity, in my opinion.  The pickled greens were delicious, and add that little bit of sourness that really made the richness of the beef and broth a bit more tolerable. The beef was fine, although it was probably cooked a little too long, and became more like shredded beef than the shank slices or chunks that I'm normally used to. I understand I'm being very nitpicky with everything, but for me, it is a matter of pride and deep nostalgia.Service was pretty quick and helpful. They even fulfilled all my little requests, like more pickled veggies and less cilantro, which was quite unexpected, but very welcomed. However, the bowl was a bit expensive at $15, including tax and tip. Not something I could go for everyday or even monthly. The quality is slightly higher than what you would find in Chinatown, but not double the quality. Yikes.Would I come back? Yes, but only because it's less than a 5 minute walk away, and perhaps only when I REALLY feel nostalgic. Not a bad place for some good, fresh biang biang noodles, but be prepared to pay a premium for it. I'm more inclined though to make the trek down to Xi'an FF for some pulled noodles, and Flushing for Taiwanese beef noodle soup.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

After eating at other noodle places, I wish the noodles were chewier, and I wish there was maybe one more piece of noodle in there? There is only 1 long piece!

Usually on the weekends there's a long line at this place, so I was pleasantly surprised to find there were no crowds at Chelsea Market.We ordered the Tingly Cumin Lamb Soup and the Vegan Noodles with Mock Duck Dry. You can choose Soup (with broth) or Dry( without broth) for either, it's personal preference, both are delicious. There are only four main items on the menu and you can't really go wrong, they only serve what they do best.The Lamb Soup was a little bit spicy and sour, the sourness is from pickled veggies that are finely chopped up in both dishes. The shredded lamb was tender, but relied on the soup for flavor and didn't seem like it was seasoned before cooking. The noodles were perfect! Chewy yet tender, you can watch them pull them by hand, just be careful while you're eating because they're super long. Chelsea Market barely has seating, so we ate in a nearby windowsill.The first time I tried the Vegan Noodles with Mock Duck, I thought it was real duck, this time I could tell since I knew beforehand(not a bad thing). It comes with plenty of shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, and green onions, so it is super fresh, but again tastes a bit sour from the pickled veggies.Seems like a good place to come for lunch if you work in the area, otherwise there are other hand-pulled noodle places around the city that are on the same level and/or better than Very Fresh Noodles.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

The noodles are very fresh, I'll give them that--you can see them making the noodles in the window--but they were also unevenly thick, so much so that they were doughy at a lot of parts. Thus not springy whatsoever. We ordered the Cumin Beef noodles-dry and spicy and the La Mei Taiwanese noodles-with broth and mild. The Cumin Beef noodles were not really spicy at all. I was expecting them to have mala spiciness from the Sichuan peppercorns and heat from the chili oil, but I didn't really taste either. All I could taste was the cumin, which actually went a little weird with beef since I'm so used to cumin & lamb combo. I did like the little pieces of pickled mustard though--it helped cut through the weird grainy texture of the sauce and the overwhelming cumin flavor. The broth for the la mei noodles was better, but too oily, so it wasn't good to drink on its own. The noodles tasted much more flavorful in this bowl though, and the baby book choy was good. The best part of both bowls was the beef-- It falls apart in your mouth, so tender and yummy! I could have done with a whole bowl of just beef to be honest.

We ordered two bowls of the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and one order of the cucumber appetizer.The good:- I feel like this is one of the most refined bowls of hand-pulled noodles I've ever had, with fall-apart tender beef and thinly sliced bok choy. - Broth was super flavorful and spicy, which I like, but might be a bit much for some.- I hope this hearkens a new Chinese style handpulled noodle boom - we have enough ramen already, people.The bad:- Noodles were a bit too thick for my liking. Xian and the Chinatown joints do this much better.- Cucumbers were not smashed, which is the right way to do this dish so all the sauce soaks into the crevices. Instead the app was just a bunch of cubed cukes in a vinegar/chili oil sauce.- Pretty expensive for a bowl of noodles, but I guess that's to be expected in this part of town.The ugly:- No seating (there are two windowsills you can set up shop in) and the area around the stall gets really hot from all the steam from the soups. This place also seems to be pretty popular - my friend and I just beat the rush, and they actually sold out (!) of noodles about an hour after we arrived.- Service seems pretty scattered, but hopefully they're working out the kinks. They forgot to make my bowl extra spicy, and didn't give us the appetizer at all until I reminded them.Wouldn't come out of my way for it again, but I can see myself dropping by if I were in the area and had a hankering for beef noodle soup.

When we made it to the front of the line, the guy who took our order was very friendly and explained the difference in beef choices to me. He suggested I get the La Mei Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup ($12), which he said was the most popular. I love extra spicy foods so I opted for the spicy version vs the mild one. We paid and waited another 15 minutes for our order to be ready. Since they had run out of food for the remaining customers, they offered them Cleaver-Smashed Cucumbers for free which I thought was very nice of them. They also offered this appetizer to all of those who were waiting for their orders. My friend and I were fasting that day so the delicious cucumbers were perfect for when it was time to break our fast since the food was not ready yet. We finally got our food around 8:40pm and found an unoccupied table in front of Sarah Beth's to enjoy our dinner.The noodles were amazing and the soup was spicy and flavorful. The beef was plentiful, tender and fell apart as you picked it up. My friend's vegan dish was also flavorful and she thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a bit of a slow eater so by the time I got halfway through the soup, I started to notice the noodles and beef getting a bit soggy and not as good. I was still able to finish most of it and would definitely come back to try it again and eat it faster next time!",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

I really wanted to like Very Fresh Noodles because there aren't any similar offerings in the area, but after eating there several times I can only say that it was a-ok. By default, I got the cumin lamb noodles in soup. Because I'm all about that lamb, about that lamb, about that lamb. I found these things problematic right away:- Hand pulled noodles need to be worked on for a while to achieve the right consistency. The dude who made my noodles slapped it around maaaaybe three or four times before throwing it into the boiling water (biang, biang------the end). C'mon man! Unsurprisingly, the noodles weren't as chewy as I would have liked them to be. - Vinegar, splashed with a heavy hand, completely drowned out all the other flavors. - Cumin not cuminy enough.

338,Bt8nelkJLaUPrJY7gFYg9Q,Carolyn Z.,4.0 star rating,Pretty solid noodle spot for Chelsea Market. It's definitely a gentrified version of traditional lan zhou noodles but none the less pretty tasty in flavor and authenticity. Seeing how the noodles were made and stretched was cool but not how its typically done regularly. The broth itself is extremely flavorful and they do have a vegan option which i got to try and must say it exceeded my expectations from the traditional lamb and beef noodles I'd have at home when my grandma would make it. Making any asian food vegan is pretty difficult without sacrificing taste but they did not miss the mark with their vegan noodle bowl. The place is tucked in the back left corner of one of chelsea markets inlets and the overwhelming smell of various food corners takes over any judgment to not overeat. Definitely a must try if in the market but there are more authentic locations for lan zhou noodles in queens,Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

My friend read about Very Fresh Noodles's soft opening so we decided to give it a try.  We ordered the La Mei Taiwanese beef noodle soup ($12) which was very good.  The noodles had a good bouncy texture (QQ as my mom would say) and the broth had a good flavor to it, not watered down or over powering.  Do keep in mind that you should have the noodle soup right away while it's hot and before the noodles get all soggy, taking away the QQ factor. The spicy isn't very spicy but it does have a little kick to it. We also ordered the dry Tingly Cumin Lamb noodles ($12) which was good the lamb was flavorful, noodles QQ and the celery gave it a nice crunch. It did however remind me of Xian's version.  Overall, the noodles were good, on the pricier side, otherwise, thumbs up for both dishes.Note: There aren't a lot of tables and chairs in the area to sit and enjoy your meal but there is a standing area by the utensils where you can eat and watch as they make the noodles.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"

I've gone twice now and haven't been able to get the lamb bowl yet because it's not available so I can't wait to try that. But the beef was delicious. The broth and spices complimented the noodles and beef.

I personally found the broth to be too heavy to drink.The noodles on the other hand were great! They were very thick and wide, thus absorbed the heavy broth very well. Also, the chef literally pulls and cooks them right in front of you, so it is very fun to watch!There was also a very generous portion of braised beef shank in the soup.

But for me it worked out famously! In a small back corner with no wait, no line, and no crowd, I found Very Fresh Noodles. They do not lie. After much debating and advisement from the cook between the few items on their soft launch menu, I settled on the tingly cumin beef noodle soup. I'm glad I did. This is hands down one of the best noodle soups I've ever had. The broth was robust and beefy, loaded with cumin, but balanced out with cascading and complex layers of spice, peppercorn, sesame oil, and other spices. It smelled beautiful and tasted even better, even though it made me sweat. It didn't burn, just had a very flavorful heat. The noodles are stretched, pulled, torn, and boiled right before your eyes and they are fantastic. Thick, wide, firm, not too salty, and really tasty. They are a bit hard to eat because they are so long but I enjoyed the challenge.The beef. Oh. That sweet, tender beef. I was surprised by how much beef was in the soup, lots of big, melt in your mouth tender chucks of roast beef that also broke up into the soup. The smaller bits mixed among the array of chopped vegetables (I don't recall now, but a blend of several hearty vegetables finely chopped and piled atop the broth just before they hand it to you) and made for an exciting sweep of flavors that definitely tingled and tantalized my palate. The to-go bowl, chop sticks, and soup spoon were convenient and disposable. Service and staff were fantastic. Food was amazing. One of the best lunch experiences I've had in NYC.

The glass show window has water splashes and the table in front where all the food is a mess. If you have an open kitchen you should be neat and organized. Im a cook as well and i see that there is definitely a sanitation issue with this place. I didnt see an oven or prep area there, does Chelsea Market have an basement kitchen? Do yourself a favor and wait until they get their sanitation grade.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"
449,gCQ9ee0LqHCB-w0ycIAr0w,Joyce L.,4.0 star rating,"I absolutely love noodles and I love hand pulled noodles even more. I am constantly craving cumin lamb noodles and came by Chelsea market so I had to try this joint. It's a bit pricy compared to its competitor but the portion size is also slightly bigger. I got the tingly lamb dry noodles and waited a good 15 minutes before it was ready. The noodles are fresh and hand pulled once your order is placed. There was a huge portion of lamb that came with it and it came with a heap of garnishes that really made a difference. The noodles were spot on, al dente and soaked up all the sauce. Also loved the hint of vinegar that is in the sauce. My only complaint is the meat. Even though I got lamb I had a hard time figuring out whether it was lamb or beef and I definitely think it would have worked better if the meat was a different texture. Since it's braised the meat was shredded when you ate it, which is not the consistency I like for lamb. Overall a solid noodle joint and one of the few that serves hand pulled flat noodles.",Very Fresh Noodles,4.0 star rating,$$,"Taiwanese,, Chinese,, Noodles"
