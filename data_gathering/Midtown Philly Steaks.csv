0,MfnkSLjnfArctA6TjmkHWA,Sarah A.,4.0 star rating,"Let me preface this review by saying I, myself, can make a pretty bomb Philly cheesesteak. Even my husband says mine are the best he's ever eaten (and he always SHOWS me the truth -- by refusing to eat something if he doesn't like it) so I know his stomach doesn't lie.These cheesesteaks from Midtown come pretty darn close to the ones I make. The portions are big -- I'm *almost* regretting that we didn't order one to split halfsies. ALMOST. A good portion of meat inside each one -- and as always, I order extra (American) cheese on mine. They serve white American here (I'm partial to yellow) -- but it definitely comes full of cheesy goodness when you fork over the 75 cents for extra. Most toppings cost extra, as do sauces, so pay attention to this if you're someone who likes a complicated cheesesteak. For me, traditional simplicity is best, with peppers and onions (at least the onions are free!) and the extra cheese. The rolls are soft and chewy and warm. Total yum. I've tried three kinds of their fries. Ranked, in order:1.) Lemon pepper (I honestly tried to eat each last seasoning crumb. SO GOOD. Tangy and sour. Perfect against the crispy saltiness of the fries. 2.) Regular--they have a tons of side dips to order -- about 75 cents each. I got the ranch and it was a fabulous combo. Their ranch is more vinegar tasting than others I've had and I loved it this way. 3.) Cajun. I'm normally a fan of Cajun fries, but these needed a little more kick. Great if you like your Cajun a bit mild. But the other two just blew these out of the water. I ordered the onion rings once ($5). I'd skip them. They were over cooked and I really didn't taste much onion flavor. So they were a bit burned tasting, too much crunch and not enough onion. I'd be slightly more upset about their $3 delivery charge (because who likes paying delivery charges ON TOP of tipping? Ugh. But the 2x I've ordered delivery from here, the food was on time and arrived piping hot.Kudos to the restaurant here for being smart enough to pack fries in paper bags instead of aluminum tins with plastic lids or god forbid those pesky styrofoam containers that leave them a wet pile of mush!!Overall, when I'm in a pinch and craving a cheesesteak, and don't feel like hauling to the grocery store and getting a bunch of ingredients to make them myself, I order from here.

They have 3 small table inside with additional seating at a counter by the front window. They also have 4 small tables outside on the sidewalk.

The cheesesteak itself doesn't come with grilled onions and add-ons such as onions require 50 cents extra per topping. Lets start with the cheesesteak. The cheesesteak is a good sandwich. Its not a great sandwich.  The bun is so soft, exactly what you want. The steak itself isn't too flavorful. Really, what you will be tasting most is the cheese. The cheese is nice and smooth. Still, nothing to write home about. This sort of uniform taste is interrupted here and there by the relatively flavorful jalapenos and  onions and I wish there were more of them in the sandwich. It wasn't a bad sandwich, and I'd eat it again, but at about $8 a sandwich it isn't very appetizing.The fries aren't very great. They smell AMAZING. But thats mainly due to the seasoning. They're crunchy. Thats good. But the taste isn't there. These are very clearly store bought fries and some spices were added on top.

Now the cheese they use is poor quality, it kept getting stuck in my teeth and on top of the roof of my mouth, which got very annoying after a few bites. It even hardened up half way while eating it, yuk!  Other than those two negatives, the meat and the fresh veggies all taste great together, making it a descent sandwich to satisfy the craving.The fries here are absolutely delicious!!! They are so crispy, piping-hot and full of goodness. Its ashame they arrived halfway into my meal, but they are worth the wait.

123,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,4.0 star rating,"I would say they are really 3.5 stars, but rounding up is deserved here. Having grown up just north of Philly city center, I know cheesesteaks pretty well. In fact it is my favorite food. Is this place, Jim's, Tony Luke's, etc. (Pats and Genos suck, sorry folks), absolutely not.  Do they try, they do! I will start by saying the Cajun fries are a MUST try. They are fantastic. The jalapeno poppers were kinda just ""ok"" but the dipping sauce a chipotle mayo really stands out as a winner, and is even better when put on the Cajun fries.On to the steaks. I've been twice now, the first time I ordered whiz wit. (plain cheestesteak with cheese whiz and onions). It was pretty good, I should have ordered extra whiz, it was lacking a bit and the lady said hers was as well. Next time we ordered extra whiz and there was a decent amount. The steak is pretty good, doubt it's rib eye though. What really makes a cheesesteak  is the roll. They are using french baguettes, which is ok, it's obviously not an Amoroso roll, but semi close. I asked them why no Amoroso and they said they are too big and don't want to work with small businesses...that seems weird to me, but ok. The onions were a bit lacking, like they had cooked them that morning, put them in a lexan and just put them on when an order came in. They weren't sitting on the grill being warmed. They are pretty quick with pick up orders (which is what we've gotten both times), even on Super Bowl Sunday. The second time I got the pizza steak, and it was meh ok. I probably wouldn't get that one again.  For an attempt at a Philly steak it's the best option in town, no doubt about that. Not as good as Shorty's in the city but a darn good try. I hope they do very well, it's nice to get a taste of home here in Hoboken.",Midtown Philly Steaks,4.0 star rating,$,"Sandwiches,, Cheesesteaks,, Chicken, Wings"

Delivery is usually quick (I live pretty close) and the food keeps its integrity - doesn't get soggy or fall apart etc. Eating in is a good experience though too. The staff is pretty friendly and the food comes out quickly. During the summer there is seating outside on Washington St. which is nice. If you go there after hours on the weekends, prepare to run into some drunk  20-somethings. Never had a bad experience, but it can be loud. Kinda small inside. A few tables and some stools up against the window.The Food - Best cheesesteak this side of the Hudson, north of Philly. BUT. And that is a big but - their specialty cheesesteaks are what shine. The Chipotle cheesesteak and the buffalo chicken cheesesteak top the lists for me. The chipotle sauce is so unbelievably on point. I wouldn't want to know the calorie count, but boy is it delicious. The buffalo sauce on the buffalo chicken is not overbearing and is accented with just the right amount of blue cheese sauce. The side dishes can be ignored for the most part, unless you're getting the chili-cheese fries.Bottom Line - It's awesome to have this place in town. Quick, easy, delicious... but not the healthiest thing of course. Major points for 4AM cheesesteak and chili-cheese fries delivered to my drunk face.

With that being said, its hard to compare a TRUE Philly cheesesteak outside of Philly. In New York, for example, I would say that Wogie's and Carl's cheesesteaks hit the mark for a good cheesesteak, and usually order from one or the other when I need my cheesesteak fix. Looks like those guys have some serious competition. This place is the real McCoy.Look, i'm not going to try to convince you this is Jim's or Geno's or Pat's from Philly. You simply can't compare such iconic places. But, as a matter of comparison I would say this place equals what you would get from a good local cheesesteak place you find in the suburbs of Philly or South Jersey. I used to order cheesesteaks from a place as a kid in Ocean City, for example called Voltaco's. Big fan. Loved the place, they had nice big steaks and good sides.This would be like that. The rolls are on the money. No, they aren't Amoroso's but they are nice big French baugettes that are chewy and fresh. The steak appears to have the same consistency and flavor of what you find around Philly, its chopped and salted - and not dry. I ordered mine with onions and marinara (a ""pizza steak"") and should add that whatever marinara sauce that they use Do Not Change - its the hallmark of a good pizza steak when someone finally understands you don't just slap Ragu on a pizza steak, but actually use something that has some flavor and some spice. Not sure what they use but it's really good and the reason why I ordered it not once, but TWICE this weekend.I tried the cajun fries and the onion rings. Both are fantastic, and I give Cajun fries the nod and even dare to say they are better than Five Guys Cajun fries. Yes, I know Five Guys are super fresh, but I really liked the crispy fries and the Cajun spice they used here, and would order that every time.Also really like the fact that they have Tastykakes. I'm a big fan of Tastykakes and love ordering them. Kind of-sort of wish they were $1.50 and not $2.00 each, I mean you can get Tastykakes at Manhattan Express Deli in Hoboken (1st and Washington St.)  for a $.85. I sincerely hope they carry chocolate Junior's which are my personal favorite. I tried Midtown twice. My first delivery on Friday was over an hour. The steak arrived lukewarm. I can't say I was thrilled about it, but to me I usually give new places a bit of a break, since they get slammed and are just starting to work out the kinks with delivery. The next night, the delivery was at 11pm on a Saturday and they were at my condo in 30 minutes with a nice hot cheesesteak. But even eating it lukewarm or real warm - both times I enjoyed eating the steak. I hope they work out their delivery problems, because no one wants to get a cold cheesesteak - but that shouldn't take away from the fact that the cheesesteak is actually very good. Lastly what gives Midtown a big plus are the hours. The best part of living around NYC is the idea that its a city that never sleeps - and i'm someone who always finds myself hungry late at night. Sometimes you only have Chinese food or pizza to choose from and its cool that you have this place open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This place is going to be very popular if they fix their delivery issues and if the quality of their product stays high.

I got a regular cheesesteak with onions, peppers, mushrooms and extra whiz (this is the way to go, if you must whiz at all) and it was everything I wanted and more. Glorious, greasy, delicious. Even though they were clearly swamped with phone orders I got my sandwich in under 5 minutes. The garlic and diablo cheesesteaks are definitely on my list of things to hit when I absolutely do come back in the future! Peppers and onions costing extra is a little weird, but that sure won't stop me.

Ask for grilled onions and cheese since they're both free other toppings are good but cost extra. Sometimes they will put whatever cheese they feel like on your cheesesteak so be warned about that. Also recently they started putting a lot less seasoning on the fries, making them almost tasteless. So if you're like me and want banging flavor even if it means health problems, ask for extra seasoning on your fries.Take a lot of napkins or be otherwise ready for messy eating, since the wrapping on the cheesesteak typically makes the entire sandwich soaked in oil.

But, this sandwich was all I could ask for- a soft, fresh roll, with lean, chopped beef with the American cheese cooked in with the steak.
