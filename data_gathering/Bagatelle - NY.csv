Gnocchi à la Parisienne There's gnocchi.  And then there's Parisian gnocchi.  Sounds way more fancy, right?  It is!  If you're familiar with a profiterole, the same dough is used to make Parisian gnocchi: pâte à choux.  Hint, there are no potatoes in the French version of this recipe.     I'm not going to go as far as to say that I prefer the French rendition to the Italian, but damn.  Nothing quite compares to these perfectly-cooked pillows of warm dough that effortlessly envelope the inside of your mouth with such a rich, savory 'carb elixir.'  Paired with a buttery cream sauce infused with a mild hint of truffle, the dish is finished with salty Parmesan cheese.  C'est magnifique!  Apple GalaThis is one of those dishes that, upon arrival, is so visually unexpected and artfully stunning that it takes your breath away.  Quite literally.  And best of all?  It tastes great, too!  I can't quite describe this masterpiece much beyond the notes on the menu: ""Mascarpone mousse, apple filling, white chocolate, sablé Breton, fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream.""  Bottom line: If you're down with apples and willing to shell out $16 for a dessert, then don't even think twice about ordering this Instagram-worthy morsel of edible art.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"
1,WuuOPTGsUTIBmSMV480IrA,Jasmin J.,2.0 star rating,"I went here for a brunch this past weekend with a group of friends. The food alone is at least 4.5 stars. Everyone at my table ordered something different (i.e. Burger, Gnocchi, Lobster Mac, Crabcakes, Disco Fries). Everything was delicious. The seasoning on the food is God-tier.However... My 2-star rating is strictly based on the service we received. Our 2:30 reservation was made a month prior to us being there. We had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. While we stood (uncomfortably, btw), we kept being pushed around very rudely by someone who I assume was management. As if it was our fault that we had no place to go. One thing about this place that we realized was, they absolutely do not stay true to their reservations, which is very unfair. They overbook, and then refuse to make people leave for other guests who planned to come there. I understand that people spend a large amount of money per table, but its inconsiderate to people who ALSO want to spend money, that are forced to stand for long periods of time, just to be rushed through their meal, so the restaurant can get them out in time to set up for dinner. I don't recommend this place for brunch. There are other restaurants that are way more organized, that will provide you the same exact experience. For dinner, however, I would hope this place has a different attitude, because I genuinely enjoyed the food and would love to have it again.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

The secret to getting a reservation is on a Saturday is to call and book or go directly to their website. You can't book on Saturday's on open but you can directly from their website. The dj is so talented. He performed saxophone solo that was just absolutely amazing.  The service was slow but the staff was polite and helpful so it made up for this shortcoming. The food was not great. Looks better than it tastes. Do not order the lobster roll- disgusting ......the strawberry margarita bowl is yummy...the crab cake is one ill re order.They perform special shows for tables the purchase bottle service .

This brunch should not even be called a brunch, it should be a freaking day club! Everyone was wearing club attire, champagne was flowing everywhere, and food was less of the priority. Once it hit 3pm,the blinds went down and the lights were off and people were dancing all over the table, my shirt was soaked with champagne and vodka, one of the girls in my group had the top of her romper off and was freaking with our waiter, and EVERYTHING JUST GOT CRAZY. They even have special themed music and people in costumes that come out for when bottles come out. Imagine Jasmine and Aladdin coming with a huge bottle aka magic lamp on a magic carpet with a whole new world playing. Shit was insane. I highly suggest for people to try this ONCE IN THEIR LIFE.

Sir, you definitely do not deserve 20% of the price of a bottle for just grabbing, uncorking and pouring it in a glass.The fact that he was petty enough to do this really annoyed me but I gave him his measly tip.Also, this establishment provides the calculated tip on your check.

15,NSIIlfSAmggFSm86dTv6sA,Hannah C.,3.0 star rating,"I've heard most people come here for the party, so it was an interesting first experience for me to come here on a Sunday night (particularly on Mother's Day also). There were only about 5 other tables seated when we went. Lights dimly lit, no crazy DJ or loud disco music spinning around (although they did give us a tease of what the real party is like towards the end of our meal). Surprisingly the dining area is small. It's two stories, the downstairs is fairly big where the bathrooms and kitchen is. The quinoa is yummy, comes with some greens, sliced radish, and a crunchy nut inside which adds some great texture to the quinoa. It tastes fresh, I think because of the citrus that goes into it. The pesto gnocchi is alright. A little too soft for my taste, I like it to have some chew to it. But I also got spoiled from having the best gnocchi throughout Italy so I'm very biased when it comes to this stuff.The burrata tomato salad was HUGELY recommended by our server and I really didn't think much of it??? If I were to describe it, I couldn't really say much more than it tasted like diced up tomatoes with cheese. Your meal comes with these mini baguettes but the melted butter concoction that comes with it is really worth a try. I can't remember what was in it (I wanna say pesto/garlic). (An insider told me the menu needed some work. I also agree.)My favorite plate was the meat dish that came with cod, risotto, vegetables, these AMAZING garlic rosemary potatoes, and two sauces I didn't care much for (didn't think it was needed with how seasoned everything else is). But if you're going to pay $160 for this I'd obviously expect it to be good. The birthday dessert (?) idk what you call it, costs ~$50 and it's an enormous mound of whipped cream, which almost two pints of vanilla and chocolate ice cream underneath. Sprinkled with brownies and a cookie along the rim. Nothing special really, nothing stood out. Again, people probably like to order this because a sparkler comes with it and it's fun? The pistachio, strawberry sorbet dessert also didn't blow me away. The tart that came with it was very hard to chew, kind of tasted stale. Haven't been here for the party, but if they know how to throw a fun time, it would be the perfect overall experience if they could combine that with amazing food!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

I had a burger and it was really good but I also tasted my friends lobster Mac and it was ehhh I've had better. & finally the vibe was really fun! The music was great & the staff was VERY entertaining. So again if you're looking to have a lit brunch deff come here if you're looking for more of a quiet brunch --stay away.

My group was probably the tamest in the whole restaurant and the most under-dressed. Who knew girls would wear sparkly cocktail dresses and louboutins and show up for breakfast on a Saturday am??! It is meatpacking after all - perhaps that's the dress code. Bagatelle's brunch did not disappoint. A few of us ordered the Eggs Bagatelle, which was delicious - smoked salmon, avocado, croissant and came with a side salad. Mimosa was ok. We were sat at a nice circular table and had a pleasant server who was patient with our splitting the bill.

The dj is so talented. He performed saxophone solo that was just absolutely amazing.  The service was slow but the staff was polite and helpful so it made up for this shortcoming. The food was not great. Looks better than it tastes.

There were only about 5 other tables seated when we went. Lights dimly lit, no crazy DJ or loud disco music spinning around (although they did give us a tease of what the real party is like towards the end of our meal). Surprisingly the dining area is small. It's two stories, the downstairs is fairly big where the bathrooms and kitchen is. The quinoa is yummy, comes with some greens, sliced radish, and a crunchy nut inside which adds some great texture to the quinoa. It tastes fresh, I think because of the citrus that goes into it. The pesto gnocchi is alright. A little too soft for my taste, I like it to have some chew to it. But I also got spoiled from having the best gnocchi throughout Italy so I'm very biased when it comes to this stuff.The burrata tomato salad was HUGELY recommended by our server and I really didn't think much of it??? If I were to describe it, I couldn't really say much more than it tasted like diced up tomatoes with cheese. Your meal comes with these mini baguettes but the melted butter concoction that comes with it is really worth a try. I can't remember what was in it (I wanna say pesto/garlic). (An insider told me the menu needed some work. I also agree.)My favorite plate was the meat dish that came with cod, risotto, vegetables, these AMAZING garlic rosemary potatoes, and two sauces I didn't care much for (didn't think it was needed with how seasoned everything else is). But if you're going to pay $160 for this I'd obviously expect it to be good. The birthday dessert (?) idk what you call it, costs ~$50 and it's an enormous mound of whipped cream, which almost two pints of vanilla and chocolate ice cream underneath. Sprinkled with brownies and a cookie along the rim. Nothing special really, nothing stood out. Again, people probably like to order this because a sparkler comes with it and it's fun? The pistachio, strawberry sorbet dessert also didn't blow me away. The tart that came with it was very hard to chew, kind of tasted stale.

The place was empty when we came in, but bumping by the time we left - packed, standing room only by the bar, loud music playing, lots and lots of large groups celebrating with giant containers of cocktails with multiple straws. My group was probably the tamest in the whole restaurant and the most under-dressed. Who knew girls would wear sparkly cocktail dresses and louboutins and show up for breakfast on a Saturday am??! It is meatpacking after all - perhaps that's the dress code. Bagatelle's brunch did not disappoint. A few of us ordered the Eggs Bagatelle, which was delicious - smoked salmon, avocado, croissant and came with a side salad. Mimosa was ok. We were sat at a nice circular table and had a pleasant server who was patient with our splitting the bill.

I loved the fancy and elegant interior. The dining room was filled with pretty, dainty chandeliers and impeccably set tables with candles, glassware and Bagatelle's own olive oil jar. We were served mini baguettes with yummy herb flavored butter doused in olive oil. The bread was very good: Fluffy with crunchy outer crust. For my appetizer, I ordered the Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas (which was + $4 and worth it). The gnocchi was homemade and came with truffle sauce and parmesan. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked with melt in my mouth buttery consistency. The truffle and pesto sauce was intensely flavorful and plentiful. It was tough trying to decide on the Main Course, but finally selected tue Saumon Grille Suace Aioli a l'Encre de Seiche, which was grilled salmon filet with quinoa and cauliflower, along with squid ink aioli sauce that was artfully dotted and spread on the sides of the plate. I must admit, this entree was plated beautifully, however the portion size was quite small. The filet of salmon was little and there wasn't much quinoa underneath. Also, there was only one piece of cauliflower. The taste of the salmon was wonderful though. I enjoyed the crispiness of the skin, the fresh flavor and how well seasoned it was. The squid ink was also good and had a mayonnaise-like taste to it. Dessert was chocolate mousse with toasted pecans and salted chocolate cookies. It was absolutely delicious! There was a delightful array of chocolate balls, brownie pieces, pecans, biscuits and cookies on top of the rich, creamy, sweet, smooth and decadent dark chocolate mousse. All the ingredients mingled together beautifully. I also got to try some of my friend's sorbet which came with raspberries and blueberries. There were three flavors of sorbet: Raspberry, Mango and Lemon. My favorite was the raspberry, then mango. All very light and refreshing.Our waiter was both charming and handsome, as well as friendly with a great sense of humor. He was knowledgeable about the menu and attended to all our requests effortlessly.

41,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"I can't comment on any of the ongoing allegations that Bagatelle has been dealt with lately, but what I will note is that when my (culturally diverse) group arrived here for dinner back in November, we had nothing short of a flawless experience with the staff and service. It was my first visit to the restaurant, as they're best known for their weekend brunch, and I have to admit that I left impressed with the quality and execution of their (mostly traditional) French dishes across the board.Coming with a large group meant that we were able to try a variety of dishes offered, including the light Ahi Tuna Tartare, which was served with an Asian-influenced Lime-Soy Vinaigrette, and complemented with a layer of creamy avocado. My preference lies, however, with the heartier starters; the pillow-y Truffle Gnocchi had an addictive black truffle pesto filling, a few slices of shaved black truffle, and maintained a surprisingly soft and fluffy texture and density. Even more impressively presented was the Truffle Pizza, which paired the mild Scarmoza cheese with Crème Fraiche, and finished the top with a generous amount of black truffle shavings.From the main dishes we tried, I would likely recommend that you order the Pan Roasted Chicken over the seafood dishes, if you have to make a choice. It may be entirely due to the fact that seafood is not my protein of preference (after all, I've only been eating it for the past few years...), but the Salmon and Halibut dishes we tried were fairly simply and traditionally prepared, and I found the salmon skin to be less than crisp and more on the soggy end. The Chicken, on the other hand, is impressively served in a large pan, and is whole-roasted with fingerling potatoes and, of course, black truffle shavings. The chicken was cooked to just the right tenderness, and retained both moisture and flavor, and the richness of the black truffle didn't overwhelm the taste. It's an ideal dish for a larger group as well, and was definitely one of the most memorable dishes of the night.Dessert is where Bagatelle really shines, however. The sheer meticulousness present in some of the dishes, like the Chouxchoux Caramel (caramelized miniature hazelnut chou puffs, milk chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce) is amazing, especially in contrast to their signature large format dessert - the ""Birthday"" Sundae. It's not listed on their official menu, but probably doesn't need any additional publicizing, as few haven't heard of (or tried) the mountain of vanilla ice cream, fudge brownies, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate and caramel syrup... and, of course, the finishing sparklers on top. Of course, you don't necessarily need to have a birthday celebration to order it, but I would recommend having upwards of 8 people in your group before attempting to make a stab at it; it's definitely not small nor light, but will completely satisfy any lingering sweet tooth.Don't let Bagatelle's Meatpacking location throw you off; the food here stays true to its French roots despite featuring a few modern touches and we never felt anything less than welcome within its walls.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

You wouldn't think a pricey French restaurant would be into displaying comic book posters on their walls...further proof as to why we shouldn't judge books by their covers, lol.As an appetizer we ordered (and shared) their Tartare de Thon which was composed of ahi tuna tartare, avocado salad and lime soy taro chips. This tasted super fresh and delicious. This comes in two portion sizes (small and large) and was perfect for 2 people to split.My friend ordered the cod meunière with fingerling potatoes, leek confit and trout roe beurre blanc. I got to try it and whole it was certainly delicious I did feel that the fish was a bit bland...but I also didn't have a ""composed tasting"", I just sampled the fish on its own.I ordered the filet mignon with their aligot. My steak was an 8 oz beef tenderloin cut and it came drizzled with a bordelaise sauce...Bordelaise sauce is a classic French sauce named after the Bordeaux region of France, which is famous for its wine. The sauce is made with dry red wine, bone marrow, butter, shallots and sauce demi-glace (thanks Google!), aligot is basically cheese-filled mashed potatoes from Aubrac. This wasn't my first time having aligot, but it was my first time having it paired with a steak. It was very rich, heavy and decadent...I finished the whole thing though and had to stop myself from licking the copper pan it came in clean.Overall we had an awesome time here. The menu is fantastic, the wine list is excellent (my rose was phenomenal) but I had to take 1 star off for service.

We were warmly greeted by the hostess, who said she could seat our partial party after we checked our coats, so we could order cocktails while we waited for the last person. The music, ambiance and atmosphere were classy and mild. No craziness... Yet. That came later. My friend was a little miffed they had no Prosecco or Lambrusco. I get it but this is a French restaurant and those are Italian wines. The drinks we ordered were all awesome, as well they should be for $10,000 each.The food was great but the portions were super small. It's cool, I knew what this was coming in. Think ""Beautiful People portions."" Friend calamari and the truffle gnocchi (omg the best thing!!!)  were great apps. For entrees we had Waygu served perfectly rare, scallops (two measly scallops? For an entree?! Come on...) and lamb shank. I tried the scallops and the beef and they were incredible.At 10pm, the party REALLY started and it was much more of a lounge than a restaurant, though the almost all the patrons were eating.

My friend ordered the croque monsieur, this looked like the same thing as the grilled cheese but with ham. Chris ordered the braised beef short rib croissant- which was amazing! Overall, I gave Bagatelle 4 stars because of the experience! The food was just average and is probably something I could get better at another restaurant.

They dimmed the lights to nothing, dropped the curtains and it felt like any other club late at night. Its pricey. Approx $150 per person but what the heck!

55,dlAhIrgrL4gROzSvjlsayg,Rahul P.,2.0 star rating,"Bagatelle's vibe meets somewhere between Euro tourist trap and Jersey/LI bachelorette party crowd (complete with horrifying tans and skanky outfits - this Jersey boy would know!) and the occasional middle-aged man with an escort. It's an interesting place to people watch - this isn't old money, this isn't new money, this is more ""middle-class but desperate to portray a luxury life on social media"". the same type of people who think riding in UberBlack makes them royalty. On the one hand, the food is actually not bad at all - I went with the beef short rib croissaint and the beef was tender, well-flavored, and served with pretty decent sides. Not the best brunch ever, but if you've done a drunk brunch concept like Il Bastardo, you know the food can be akin to eating out of a trash can. The dining area is super-packed and the tables and chairs stay when they switch out the lights to pretend this is a nightclub. Then I witnessed have the most bizarre gimmick of all time - waiters dressing up in cheap costumes and being carried with sparklers to pour Dom Perignon Vintage into people's mouths and all over their clothes. The gimmicks continued - mediocre saxophonist and drummer, giant ""fishbowl"" style sangria with big colored straws. The whole vibe is super-trashy (right down to NYU kids coming to other tables to beg for a sip of champagne), yet somehow this place is so ""exclusive"".

I had the steak tartar on rice cakes which was a large portion enough to share. The tuna tartar was also a hit with the table. We moved on to the Rack of lamb prepared to medium rare which was absolutely perfect. My husband had the duck with the Asian flair and I like the flavor and it was a large portion that was very meaty. I prefer a fattier cut but for the healthy eater this is perfect. To end we tried three desserts but the favorite for me was a delightful passion fruit cheesecake which was served in a cup and actually had the flavor of cheesecake but much more delicious.  We know the party starts a little later as celebrities rolled in and sparkler filled champagne bottles were being served up.

There was a group of 8 of us who came for dinner. We had a reservation so we were seated promptly when we arrived. The restaurant is a bit dark, but classy. The restaurant is definitely pricey  (25-40/entree) but lucky for my wallet we came during restaurant week. Personally, restaurant week can be hit or miss but Bagatelle did a great job. For my 3 courses I had crab salad with fennel and citrus dressing, truffle chicken with roasted root veg and creme brulee for dessert. All were delicious! And the portion sizes (especially the chicken) were good sized. Only reason this is 4 stars is because of staff. We had to wait about 10 mins longer than we would have liked to order, had to ask for bread, and waited some time for a check.And pro tip: if you're wine connoisseur friend is choosing the wine for the evening be sure to give them a price point to stay below.

And what an excellent experience it was.  From start to finish, everything was excellent.  We were seated and we asked to move as there was a large plant hanging over us.  No problem.  Moved immediately.  We ordered a bunch of things from the menu and shared around the table.  I have a seafood allergy, so I did not partake in the variety of seafood at the table, especially the shellfish tower.  That said, everyone raved about it.  I did have the truffle gnocchi and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  Both were excellent.  For our mains, we had a bunch of seafood entrees and a bone-in ribeye for two with roasted potatoes.  The steak was amazing as were the potatoes.  For dessert, we had a chocolate mousse, a few other items I can't remember, plus a massive ice cream sundae.  By massive, I mean huge.  It was enough ice cream for 10 people.To top all of it off, the service was excellent.  We were very well taken care of by the staff.  They were there when we needed them, but they were never hovering around the table or trying to rush us through the dinner.  I can't wait to go back!!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

One negative.  I must comment on my Bloody Mary drink.  For the high quality and price of this restaurant, I feel they should make a better effort for the staple brunch drink.  It was very basic (I watched the bartender make it).  To me, a Bloody Mary is all about the flavor and accoutrements.  This tasted just OK and it was a pretty basic olives on a stick adornment.I would call this place trendy.  Many people were dressed to be seen.  Some looked like they were dressed for (or from) a night out, especially the women.  Tight dresses, lots of side boob. :)  It was ""brunch time"" on a Sunday.  So while some of the outfits were head turning, others were simply amusing.  :) It's an expensive place so be forewarned.  Granted, we did share a bottle of Champagne between three people (it was brunch remember).  The bill was nearly $90 per person, before tip.  I stopped at 3 stars.  If the price was more in line with the food and the Bloody Mary was better,  I'd have given 4 stars.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

Now, their pizza (yes the French aren't known for pizza), but their pizza a la truffle noire was TO DIE FOR! A few slices of that paired with their salad and a bit of their tuna tartar will keep you coming back for more each time. Keep in mind that one pizza is good enough to share among a group. For entrees, I had the pleasure of trying several of their seafood dishes along with their truffle roasted chicken with potatoes and gnocchi. I wasn't in a seafood evening that evening so the latter dishes stand out since they were exquisite.I must note that the service and attentional to detail at Bagatelle is exceptional from the moment you walk in.

It's literally garbage.Service: slow, understaffed. after receiving our menu, the dude came back two minutes later and was not seen again until 10-15 min later, no one asked us once if we were ok (it's loud but it was just the two of us, so it was possible), for each course it took them 20 min to take away our plates- unacceptable. The host of the party- a renowned business owner/celebrity I suppose, had to hand the dishes to the waiter because they were there so long. There was one bus boy that was actually kind and helped with our needs- he had a beard and a foreign accent.Regular menu: painfully overpriced. Prix fixed menu:  We didn't get served dinner until AFTER TEN!!! The party started at 8!!!Tuna tartar was good.My tasteless stripped bass was undercooked- felt like I was eating mush, I told them to cook it more. When it came back out, they put it on a new plate with very very little sauce. Sauce was watery and had no flavor; I could've made better. The sides were the absolute worst part. I'm embarrassed for them. Mine came with two big chunks of onion(?) (WTF) that was so hard to cut and eat. My friend's came with french fries. We're paying a TON of money. Don't you think we deserve better sides???? And two sides instead of one seems quite fair to me for $55 a plate!! It was $68 with tax and a 15% tip which only the bus boy deserves. CAN YOU FEED US. My bfs Mac and cheese wasn't terrible, but they used a  mini penne pasta. That's not a Mac and cheese noodle. We ordered the creme brulee but they then told us later there was no more. AGAIN, unacceptable.Entertainment: Piercing music. It does NOT have to be that loud!! You couldn't talk to anyone. My throat hurts from screaming. Creepy costumes.

We also got a dish reminiscent of poutine to share - fries with cheese, scallions, short rib, bacon, and more with a fried egg as the cherry on top.I've seen some complaints about the service here on Yelp and I can say that in my experience, it was nothing less than amazing.

Nice presentation but nothing to write home about.  The best part of this brunch was the party atmosphere.  There was a DJ playing dance music, getting everyone hype.  The price tag for all of this... Over $100 per person for a simple entree and a few rounds of drinks.  Definitely over priced (in my opinion).  And...

Tips are unsurprisingly slammed with promoters, and there's a huge number of reviews, yet barely mention anything but brunch or drinks, yet the lady friend insisted on coming here anyway. They must not get many reservations, because they called three times AND sent a confirmation email to make sure we'd show up, presumably because 1000 OT points means a bigger cut to OpenTable. We were initially seated inside, which was ridiculously loud already at 5:30, and our booth seats were quite dirty, so we relocated outside, which was fine. The bread to start was solid, and the scallops were properly cooked, and the fries were fine (albeit with zero ketchup/aioli/etc), but the steak was pretty awful.

He made us give a credit card at the beginning and told us they do that because there's people that walk out without paying the bill, however, a card information is needed when you make a reservation so that was unnecessary. Then we order the pitcher of a drink and he said they didn't serve in the cups, that's why they gave us straws, but then again the server for the other table was serving everybody in a cup from the pitcher. Finally when we received the check, we decided to pay the total first and then add the tip, the server was so upset and told me to add the tip right there and I told him ""no, you're making this so complicated"" so he responded ""I do this shit every weekend, you ain't gonna tell me how to do it"" as he was pushing my arm. I requested to speak with the manager and as I was talking to the manager, the server went back to my table to tell my friends ""what's wrong with her?!!!"".  I should've called the police instead because it was my birthday and he put his hands on me.

Like a McDonald's gourmet burger, its facade implies a higher quality product, but let's be real, McDonald's ain't foolin' nobody.The whole place is a paradoxical mix of trash and class. The decor included beautiful chandeliers alongside paintings with swear words scrawled across them. The crowd ranged in attire from t-shirt/jeans and mini-skirts, to jackets and stilettos. Most of the women had on full faces of heavy clubbing makeup, and looked incredibly out of place at Sunday brunch. The waitstaff had an air of pretention but looked like high school/college kids from across the Hudson. The food and drinks are very expensive, but thankfully, pretty tasty. We did not stay to witness the restaurant-to-nightclub transition, so I can't speak to the party.Overall, I can't justify dropping hundreds on pretend fancy.

It reminded me of a brunch you could have in Las Vegas. We arrived around 11 am for brunch, and they said the reservation is good for about 2 hours. Luckily, they didn't have a reservation immediately after, so they let us stay til about 2pm. During brunch, it was relatively quiet and intimate. As the day went on, it got louder and rowdier, with a full on party with music, DJ, and lights turned off by 3pm. The food itself was DELICIOUS!!! The truffle pizza, French toast, and heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese was my favorite. We ordered a second of the salad and the pizza; all of us were using the sauce in the salad as a drip for our breads. The French toast itself was so moist and fluffy. It just melts in your mouth. They offer the option of adding Nutella on the side for $2 (which is a tiny little ramekin); the French toast was delicious without it, so I wouldn't recommend the nutella for taste or the price. We also ordered the grilled cheese, which was all cheese on the outside and inside. It was good, however I wasn't too impressed with it. My least favorite item was the gnocchi we ordered; I thought it lacked flavor and there wasn't anything unique to it that you couldn't find at a standard Italian restaurant for a much cheaper price. The drinks itself were good - nothing amazing or particularly unique/special. This place is definitely on the pricier end, however worth the food and great atmosphere. The crowd is a mix of young professionals and younger 40-year olds.

I knew right there and then I'd be in good hands. I was immediately impressed by the ambiance and overall vibe from the restaurant. The décor is elegant yet has a quirky vibe with the interesting artwork adorning each wall. I especially enjoyed the open space and those gorgeous chandeliers. As for the food, every single thing that came onto my plate was nothing short of excellent. We had quite an array of options that night - each of them getting better with each course. We started off with a plethora of appetizers (which in my opinion were enough for a meal on its own!) and included their Salade Bagatelle which was a very refreshing start to our meal. The Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas as well as the Pizza à la Truffle Noire were absolute standouts. I'm personally a HUGE fan of truffle anything and the flavors in these dishes were just divine. Next was the Seafood tower prestige which included a tower-assortment of oysters, shrimp, lobster, caviar, whitefish, halibut, clams, king crab... the list could go on. I think I've only had caviar once or twice in my life so this was certainly a delicacy. All of the seafood was stellar not to mention very fresh.As for the entrees (I know, so much food!) we all split (I believe this is the one) the Cote de Boeuf Pour Deux and the Filet de Saumon which were both great. At this point I had to seriously pace myself because I was warned that there would be dessert. And indeed there was. Desserts happen to be one of my favorite things - I have a such a sweet tooth, so I was looking forward to something small to end the fantastic meal I've just had. They don't do small here. Out rolls the Mousse Chic Choc, the Caramel Chouchou, the Pavlova Fraises et Vanille (the descriptions are lengthy so I'll let you look those up yourself) and the GIANT Ice Cream Sundae/mountain adorned with sparklers and basically big enough to feed two tables, or even maybe more. When I say I've never been more full in my entire life, I mean it. Every component of my dining experience was wonderful. The quality of the food, the stellar service, the club-like ambiance (when the sun went down - so much fun) and the phenomenal company. My compliments to the staff and the chef.

For that reason, I was skeptical. However, I was told that they have a great menu for dinner and that I would be surprised.So I went.  There was a DJ playing music.  However, it was not so loud that the group could not have conversations.  Our party of five sat for dinner.  The appetizers were shockingly good.In particular, the scallop was good. However the crab salad was like a ceviche.  It was really phenomenal.  The octopus was great as well.  However the crab was pretty memorable.The ahi tuna tartare was a nice size and was tasty.  The truffle pizza was really different and had a great taste to it.The Chou Frise was a Kale Salad with dried cranberries, ricotta cheese, pickeled shallots & lemon & Jean Evo.  This is a nice way of saying it was some Kale and Cheese. Nothing to go crazy about at all.The truffled roasted chicken was way juicier than I expected and had a good taste to it.The bone in ribeye steak was perfectly cooked and tasty.  The Gnocchi was very good.Where Bagatelle shines and is probably one of the most under rated restaurants in the City is for dessert. One Dessert. The Ice Cream Sundae.The Huge Sundae they serve is pretty amazing.  It comes out with sparklers and its own show.  It is a great birthday cake replacement.  It can feed lots of people.  It puts traditionally popular places like the popular ice cream/hot chocolate/sundae spot in midtown that I will not name to shame. Bagatelle is more than capable of competing for best group ice cream spot. If ever flying bottles of Dom P. in via superman and sparklers does not work out for them, they would still crush most of the birthday crowd with just this sundae.  It is massive.I also saw some groups nearby eating and drinking Dom P., each bottle being delivered with fanfare. Superman was carried by some men while flying one in.  Apollo Creed seemed to deliver another one as if he was entering the ring.  It seemed like the customers were happy.  However, it was the food on my table that had me there, and the food on my table that surprised me.  Before this week, I would never have considered Bagatelle for a ""grown folks"" dinner.  My opinion has changed.Bagatelle, the home of the amazing large sundae that your whole party probably won't finish.  That is my review.  It is one of the best kept secrets in the city.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

The chicken was top notch, the fish, deboned at the table, customer service, and desserts were fabulous. Highlights were: cocktails, creamed spinach, chicken, (half or whole, ordered the half) sautéed veggies that accompanied the fish special, prawns were excellent, and creme brûlée!

Instead I had to interrupt them.  The first woman I spoke to I indicated that I had a reservation for my birthday.  She looks and me and tells me to speak to a woman who was standing right next to her. I was put off by the manner in which she passed me off.  My level of annoyance began to increase at that point.I eventually checked in and then I left the host stand to check my coat.  When I returned  to be seated, I again had to interrupt the same group of staff from there conversation to be acknowledged. We eventually were seated by a woman who didn't have the decency to escort us to the table.  Instead she walked ahead of us with a space of at least 5 feet.  When we arrived at the table she handed us our menus and didn't say a word.  We had our meal which was great as I mentioned above.  The last straw was when we received our check, the waiter puts it on the table and immediately says he needs the table.  In other words pay us and get the f*ck out. Lastly, The brunch wasn't fun The party doesn't even start until 3PM.  If you don't have a reservation around 3 PM, don't expect a party.

The food was okay and was the least of our problems. We were seated right away as we did have a reservation. Our table was sandwiched in between 2 large parties, none of which were seated yet. We sit down and begin to look at the menu, then our waiter comes over, doesn't introduce himself or welcome us to the restaurant, all he does is ask if we are ready to order some wine. We said we needed more time so he left, and when he returned again, he asked the same question. No personality and no hospitality at all. He was just a man that showed up with his pad and paper to take orders; I expected more from a place like this. We finally order, the appetizers come out within 10 minutes, and entrées the same. The entrées came out so quick that our second bottle of wine wasn't even at our table until after the entrées were dropped. Way too rushed. Then, the other big parties next to us begin to arrive. One of the parties was larger than anticipated so they had to add more chairs, at this point it was getting a little crowded. One of the staff then came to our round table of 5, and pushed one of the sides of the table in to give that other table more room, while we were more squished. No one asked if that was okay or apologized, they just came in and pushed our table in! Then dessert, we waited more than 20 minutes for dessert!! There must have been a problem in the kitchen but our server did not even come to us saying its going to be delayed. We felt a bit ignored once the big parties began to arrive. Customer service could definitely use some improvement and was extremely disappointing. On the flip side the bussers were great, water glasses always full, table cleared and cleaned, and new silverware put down promptly. Atmosphere was modern and had a trendy young vibe which was nice.

We were pleasantly greeted and every 5 minutes asked if we wanted to be seated.My friend invited me to a dinner that he was treated to and i said hells yeah, i will go.When we collected 4 bodies to sit, we asked to be taken to our table and wait for the rest and they agreed (usually restaurants dont let you sit if the entire party is not there)PS: I can only review the food, service and venue as i was invited and i didn't have to pay.The Decor: chic but weird as it has curse words on paintings around the place. Large bar and huge dinning area. The Food: Since I was invited by a friend i just took in what i was given. Plates just kept coming in and empty ones leaving.We were delighted with so many good plates, the Ahi Tuna Tartare was super delicious. drizzled with what seems a light oil and paired with avocados (im allergic to but still had them). The Truffle Pizza was actually pretty dam good and as one of my friends mentioned ""the french are not know for pizza"" but this was just right on point. It seems that a lot of their dishes contain Truffle and why not who am i to judge. We had what seemed to be fish (halibut) ceviche type of dish and i was a fan of very much. Im really bad with names of things and this is when i should have written it down but i bet someone will remind me (lori can you please).The only plate i was blah about was the pan Roasted chicken, I was just bland to me. Fall off the bone but i was expecting maybe more flavor or a different taste to it. This was also served with Truffle but didn't give me the wow factor that most of the other dishes did.More plates came along but i stayed with the Fish dishes as i'm a seafood lover (see food and i eat it)Desert came along: OMG it was UGE (huge for the rest of us) It was a tower of Ice cream with more ice cream with chocolate and few other sweets that i cant.. just cant. You need to have 6-10 people dig at it, its just too big.The Service: The service was perfect, from the time we arrived to until we left. 3 ladies at the door greeting patrons and french servers always re-filling our waters and bringing us wine. The place got packed for what it seemed to be a french bastille day party and even with this, our service was amazing.I will definitely try to go again, i do see people and the recent lawsuit affecting this place but let me make sure its what people are saying. Our group was very mixed and we did not see any of the allegations. I sure hope is not for all of us sake.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

We made a reservation for a party of 6, about a month in advance for 2pm on a Sunday. When we walked in, we saw ladies decked out in full on clubbing outfits in the early afternoon, with a mix of trendy, bar or dinner outfits. We first ordered brunch food - Eggs Benedict, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Gnocci, pizza - all very pricey ($25-$40 per plate) and shared a large Mojito Fish Bowl ($395). The mojito was hugeee and delicious - it came with 20 glow in the dark straws and everything was a lot of fun. As we ate, the restaurant lights dimmed, curtains closed and the throbbing lights went up. It turned into a full-out club.  The DJ started playing EDM/hip hop/top 40 music and people started dancing on tables and being carried on people's shoulders. Every 30 minutes or so a table would be delivered a large bottle or a big dessert that would be delivered by either Superman, Darth Vader or Marie Antoinette accompanying music and sparklers - it's a great party atmosphere. The music and dancing was great - you just start dancing with everyone around you - it's like going to a nightclub in the middle of the day.Now, the downside of coming here is that everything is overpriced. For the 6 of us, the bill came out to be over $1,200, including two champagne bottles. However, everything about Bagatelle is fabulous and I guess that is expected from a popular party brunch place in meatpacking.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

This past Sunday we went to this place to celebrated my best friends 28th birthday . she made the reservation over a month ago to ensure we would get a table because as Halloween weekend we know everywhere gets crazy. It was 11 of us for a reservation at 2. They told us 15-20 min. After 45 min we started to get annoyed and went to speak to the Host who from the beginning was very rude . She said to the manager in front of my friend , ""I'm not dealing with this girl"". Shortly after we saw a group of 14 walk in and get seated almost immediately. We complained again and were given one free drink ticket per person . After 2.5 hours of waiting we were finally offered a table but the catch was it only sat 8 people. We were all so hungry at this point we just took the table. Then we asked for a comped bottle and they refused. We barely ate a few appetizers and then left shortly after. We are all native New Yorkers who go out and spend money frequently, we know how the business works. This is one of those places where you have to know someone to have a good time. Unfortunately we didn't have a connection and they made sure we felt uncomfortable. If you are planning to do a brunch party in manhattan save yourself the time and money and book it somewhere else.

When we arrived at 7:30pm it was fairly calm with low music playing in the background.  At around 9p is when the music level elevated but not to the point where you couldn't hear one another, bottles with lit sparkles were being popped and a few people were dancing in their area.  I really enjoyed the vibe.  It's just the right amount of upbeat atmosphere for a weekday.There are several reasons why I would go back & recommend Bagatelle to a friend.First and foremost it would be for the exceptional food & service.For a special celebration or to treat myself, as the menu prices are on the higher end.For date night when I want to classy it up a bit. To partake in the craziness of the brunch party.Thanks Bagatelle for a wonderful evening!

Located in the Meatpacking District, it's a true gem of a place. It's very expensive so you must be willing to splurge. The gnocchi and French toast are the best! The dessert they bring out for birthdays is enormous and delicious. If you buy a bottle, they bring out very creatively. I've had superman fly it out to us and a Trojan man bring us a bottle once. The music is great and it has a St Tropez vibe. This place gets really wild and people end up dancing on tables and chairs to great beats. The waiters are hilarious and will dance with you.

There were 12 of us and we sat down during the first seating at 1230.  It became clear to me that the second seating, which I think is 3pm is what costs $$$ as the blinds close, it gets dark, the attire gets clubbier, and the music starts getting LOUDER.I didn't think it was pretentious in here.  How could it be when honestly when most real New Yorkers don't go here regularly- you'll find older B&T folk, younger B&T folk, foreigners, visitors, bachlorette parties, etc.  And as long as you know that and soak it all in, it is a fun time.  They do play good music and have good drinks. With brunch, I had a really decent Bloody Mary and Irish coffee (funny, they don't pay much attention to you if order coffee sans the alcohol), and the ""Cheeseburger Bagatelle"" which was really meaty but messy.  Came with decent fries (though it didn't list it on the menu, I thought everything was a la carte). Among the other girls, I saw many mimosas, bellinis, eggs benedict, goat cheese frittatas, french toast (looked the best!), and other ad hoc lunch items like the filet mignon tartar and lobster mac.  I would advise sticking with classic brunch items - like anythings eggs or french toast or a burger for lunch.   If you order bottle service, they deliver it via a flying Superman (a waiter in a costume), and a sparkler. They had other cheese plates and the like to share... but we didn't share. We only shared an off the menu ice cream sundae which came with a sparkler and was $55 which could have fed like 30+ people so very reasonable. It was also the yummiest thing I had - whip cream, vanilla/chocolate ice cream, brownie/cookie, granola. Yum.Service is a bit slow/spotty and you had a 2 hour limit on the table before it needs to be turned over for the next group, of which then you can just wait at the bar.  But it's ok, you're there to chill and have fun so no rush.  This is a great place for out of towners and groups, and glad I tried it out.  Can't say I'd be a regular though.  This Club Brunch was better than il Bastardo which we also tried.  I left too early around 3ish but apparently afterward, door service starts and it gets clubbier and clubbier.(P.S. There is a coat check and bathroom lady who gives you paper towels, etc).Brunch was $80 after tax/grat. I believe they also have a pre fixe menu for $75 pre tax/grat.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

He was spinning a mix of chill dance music, which was perfect to turn up the night a bit, but still allowed me to have a conversation over the music. The manager, John, was incredibly welcoming. He checked on us a few times and answered every question we had about the food/wine (the man has a lot of patience!). I was so impressed with the way they ran this place.THE FOOD: Tatare de Thom Bagatelle: Refreshing and tangy--the perfect medley of fresh ahi tuna, avocado, and crispy taro chips on the sidePizza a la Truffle Noire--Pizza and truffle. Need I say more? Large enough to share with a table and perfect if you're craving a truffled dish (who doesn't?)Charcuterie Board -- small bites of cheese with a sweet bread.

Additionally, there are so many amazing French restaurants in New York and this place has a hard time breaking the top 30 or 40.Service:The service is the bright spot of this restaurant but it still has many questions surrounding it. Servers are extremely polite, attentive and caring. However, when you're there for lunch with almost no other patrons in the restaurant, dessert should not take 30 minutes.Summary:This place is nice but pretentious.

Yes 12 was set for 11 and was so cramped we said ""we'd pretty much eat in shifts""The hostess was less than understanding in her demeanor and solutioning. Completely unhelpful or cared really We just got another chair and place setting and that took 20 mins to get done. And the we started getting ""service"".When i say we ate in shifts, we initially said it as a frustrated joke but it became a self fulfilling prophecy.When the the appetizers came, 8 of us got ours first and were half way done eating, when two more got their's, and most were done when the last two received theirs. Unsure how the food were fired and spaced out in the back but our poor server who was actually the only saving personnel was doing his best to mask some clear failings and incompetence. Then came the main. Same thing happened which gobsmacked us- cos we thought it certainly couldn't continue 7 first (and the servers kept yelling across the table ""who had the duck?"", ""who ordered potatoes?"") - it was a diner with much less charmAt this point. People had to start eating while others watched againThen 4 more arrived 12 mins later (I timed it) FYI one was a chicken dish which arrives in a sauce pan by design..But took us additional 7 mins to get a dinner plate for our friend to eat his meal The last one they screwed up the gluten free order so that just didn't arrive for another 10 minsAgain we are in shifts!!! And hear meals aren't cheap!! Our saving grace waiter compensated with some champagne to our gluten free friend and profound apology but this night was sunk... Sad ...cos honestly the food is mostly goodOh barring the one person who had fish with bones in it!! And had to send it backIt was taken off the bill... Duh!!!!!!Boy this night was trying Our server - again the one saving grace brought the check and if it is was the custom of the restaurant (I doubt it) or him understanding that the outcome was less then ideal, didn't include the gratuity for the large table. Which was probably a good move We opted as a group to not punish him, the bartender or the bussers for the failings of the front of house or kitchen and additional serving staff incompetence and tipped appropriatelyThen the party began - a little jarring and gimmicky but we knew it was coming. Some got their meal taken away before they were done. But at this point ... No one spilled on us so we call that a win I guessWe didn't want to ruin our friend so we stayed and had one shot and ordered a bottle of champagne when the disco lights came on .. And then soon got the hell outta dodgyNot one time did the front come by and ask about anything.

163,KKds2byEcYexxyWukiZa7Q,Sheldon S.,5.0 star rating,"Some friends and I recently went to have a wonderful feast on a Thursday evening. At about 7:30 on a cold night right off a cobble stone street in the Meatpacking District I arrived to a warm welcome at Bagatelle. Before I even reached the bar to wait for the rest of my party to arrive I encountered five different employees, all greeting me with huge beautiful bright smiles.The restaurant that happened to be the setting for our evening was what might be considered the birth child of when classy got with hip. Or perhaps a better description, it was the result of when a bunch of undercover hip people, including the staff, showed up at a classy restaurant. This all became very evident, reaching the point of being unmistakable, as soon as I laid eyes on the cool suggestive artwork donned by the walls. Then again, the restaurant might have described itself best, ""...the chic St. Tropez meets Paris."" This place is legendary for its epic party-like brunches, but now can also be touted for its great food with the masterpieces from Chef Sébastien.Once my entire party of 7 arrived we commenced with our communal style meal with appetizers and wine at about 8 pm. We started with salad, grilled octopus, homemade gnocchi, black truffle pizza, ahi tuna tartar, king crab leg, and main diver scallops. Like myself, the entire group enjoyed everything, but I also had a few personal favorites of my own.Grilled Octopus, aka Poulpe Grillé à la Plancha(white bean hummus, crispy Yukon gold, Kalamata olives aioli)...was juicy, tender and flavorful. Suddenly I don't know if I can ever look at Ursula off the Little Mermaid the same way again. Where you may see evil, I see potential, a lot of delicious potential. Whoever thought octopus could taste this good?Homemade Gnocchi, aka Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas(black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce)...was perfectly cooked with an excellent texture and by far the best I have ever had. Thought to originate in the Middle East, whomever first created gnocchi would be very pleased with what has come of it, at least the gnocchi I had.Black Truffle Pizza, aka Pizza à la Truffle Noire(black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza)...was extremely flavorful, decadent in a good way, but also well balanced. To even call something that taste so unique, but still so good 'pizza' seems blasphemous. Yeah, I was lucky enough to have two slices due to everyone else's efforts to King Crab Leg, aka Ceviche de Crabe d'Alaska(king crab leg, habanero & citrus ""leche de tigre"", smoked trout roe)...was remarkable as the sweet flavors of crab danced with acidic citrus and lightly spicy habanero. This was a threesome I am fully willing to stand behind anytime if it looks like this.After our light and not so light apps the more hearty heavy hitters came out. We had whole-truffle chicken, center cut beef tenderloin, and pan seared marinated Hudson Valley duck breast. Of the three I enjoyed the Châteaubriand - Pour Deux best (24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for two). The truffle potato purée might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. They were thick and richly flavorful. Not really sure what else I should say about them. I will just add this though. Immediately I formed a gripe towards every other establishment I've ever had truffle anything from. Every single thing Chef Sébastien put truffles in or on that we ate was simple amazing. Hell, I didn't even think I cared that much for truffles before Bagatelle. Up until this point I've been cheated of great truffle experiences and someone owes me answers!Next came the desserts. We had Italian meringue crisp, white chocolate tart, dark chocolate mousse, and caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff....drops spoon!!!! The Chouchou Caramel though! Wow! ...caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff and milk chocolate caramel sauce, was incredible! On your visit you should tell your server Sheldon sent you, then ask for it because it isn't on the menu. Okay, that will most likely increase your chances of getting the Chouchou by 0%, but it sounded good. HaHaCenturies after spices and food from around the world was made available to the rest of the world, a mad scientist figured out how to pair these ingredients together perfectly. Chef Sébastien is an evil genius with a life goal of dooming everyone who is fortunate enough to partake in his delicious creations. He wants to doom us to eternal gluttony!

166,XOJJ4DDK2h_3s6djlEp9GQ,Melanie A.,4.0 star rating,"Okay...if you only read one Bagatelle review, you need to read this one. I'm going to give you the FULL rundown of Bagatelle boozy-brunch Sundays.SO! To start, you better make a reservation. Don't even think of trying to come to Bagatelle on a Sunday brunch day and expect to be seated at a table. That's laughable. You MAY be able to get in and stand at the bar but who the hell wants to do that? Reservation time? This depends on if you want to eat beforehand. If you want to eat in peace without sitting in darkness and hearing music so loud you can't talk to anyone at the table then make it for 2:30/3pm. That will allow you time to order food and eat it before the madness starts. At exactly 3:30 the music starts going full-on. Make sure you also arrive within 10/15 minutes of your reservation or you risk them not allowing you to sit at your reserved spot.Second of all, if you come with just a party of 2 for brunch, be prepared to have a shitty table. Yeah, I said it. I didn't see one party of 2 people that had an even halfway decent table. Two of the 2-top tables are literally in like the hallway/walkway of the restaurant so there will be tons of people blocking the view of the place. If you come to Bagatelle and want to do it right, get at least 4 people and make a day of it.Third of all, at tables for large parties it's bottle service only. You can get some relatively cheaper wine bottles so it's not like you'll be shelling out thousands of dollars on boos but just keep that in mind that everyone will be pretty much drinking the same thing. They have this huge (I don't even know how to really properly describe it) almost like a vase thing filled with boos and there are like 10 straws in it so you can share (if wine and champagne isn't your thing). Basically, everything alcohol-wise is shared.Food. Yes, order food here. It is after all, a brunch. I ordered the tuna tartare. I was a little skeptical because I hadn't had Bagatelle food in a long time and ordering raw fish was not the first choice for me but I didn't want something super sugary (pancakes/nutella) or super fattening (lobster mac & cheese/pizza) so I went with a much healthier option and it did not disappoint. Seriously, it was the best tuna tartare I've ever had (see photo that I uploaded with my review). It comes with chips to dip which I did not show in the picture, but seriously this is a must-order even to share as an appetizer (or main-course).Now on to the scene. Yes every girl will be wearing a Chanel bag and look like she just took 7 hours to get ready. Yes you may see some creepy dudes with sunglasses on who look like they have a Jersey Shore audition after brunch but come on people, this is Bagattelle. It is to be expected. Just set your expectations properly.If you order certain bottles of champagne and alcohol, they do their own show just for you in front of everyone. I believe it's $1,500 minimum but they deliver your bottle in really unique ways and never the same way twice. For instance, they can have 5 guys holding up one guy with your bottle and he's dressed as superman. The music cues as well so it's a big eye-catching production. If you want to see and be seen, I'd opt for that.Now, on to the bill. I left early and gave him cash towards the bill for my portion of everything. I informed my friends of this and told them how much I gave so they could make sure that the bill was properly adjusted. He did not tell them at all that I had paid anything nor did he adjust it off of the bill. So, had I not told them exactly what I gave him, he would have tried to play it off like I never paid. I didn't like this at all because it just showed how shady he was. I think that they assume people get so drunk and want to take advantage as many others have stated in the reviews as well. SOOO be very careful with what your order. Even though you're having a good time, just try to monitor exactly what you guys order so that no surprises come at the end.All & all, this is a really fun brunch spot for a special occasion. I wouldn't make this an every week thing, but it's a fun thing to do once in awhile. I have also had dinner here on regular nights and wasn't disappointed but the music was too loud for dinner. Anyways, for brunch, this is a go-to spot.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

So we waited about an hour and 20 mins before we were seated!! CRAZY!  If it wasn't my friend's bday I probably would have left cause that's nuts.  Also the place became super crowded while we were waiting, so no matter where we stood we were in the way.  Around 3 is when they shut the curtains and the dance party starts.  One of our friends had the sense to go get some champagne and we had some mimosas while we waited.  Finally we were seated, right by the DJ, but at least we were away from the crowd by the bar.  So literally 5 mins after we were seated they were taking our order, apparently once you're seated they don't waste any time. We waited to be seater longer than it took for us to order, receive and eat our food. I had low expectations for the food, but it surprised me and what I got was really good.  I got the short rib sliders which had grilled pineapple, cheese and coleslaw on top.  I also got a side of fries which were really good too.  Expensive, but good.  One of our friends ordered a bottle of champagne to arrive at the table via a waiter dressed as (i think) George Washington, along with lots of sparklers.  This happened a lot throughout the day, all with different characters: superman, yoda, storm trooper, ghost buster, etc.. I though the music was pretty good, and it was fun to get up and dance once we finished our food.  We even ordered a LARGE sundae for my friend, which also came out with sparklers around it.  Overall I did have fun, but I didn't pay for any of the alcohol we drank, so I don't know if I would have been as happy at the end of the day if i had.  I also don't think I would have had as much fun without drinking.  This place is just not really my scene.  It was fun for my friend's birthday and I think she had a good time, but I don't know that i'll be back any time soon.  I mean waiting an hour and 20 mins when you have a reservation is really unacceptable..",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

We were so excited to come celebrate at bagatelle. We arrived promptly at 2:30 for our reservation and we were told by the rude hostess to wait by the bar until our table was ready. I decided to wait near the hostess station just to make sure they didn't forget about us while my party waited at the bar. Well, I waited there for TWO HOURS. Every 20 mins or so I would very nicely check in with the hostess to see the status of our table. Each time, I was very rudely dismissed and told the table was not ready yet. Sometimes she wouldn't even acknowledge me at all. After standing there for 2 full hours and nearly in tears, I asked to speak with a manager at which point the manager told me there was no way of knowing if we would even be seated at all. At this point, we left without even an apology or acknowledgment  from the staff after wasting 2 hours waiting for our table. My poor friends one and only bachelorette party was RUINED.

You can get better quiche at your local deli.  My biggest issue and this is partially my fault I admit is the ridiculousness of a $215 cocktail.  Now their cocktails on average ran from $20-$40.  I was reading the menu quickly and saw it as $21.5.  The waiter did come back  to me and asked if I was sure I wanted the cocktail.  Now honestly I assumed he asked me that because of the loud jack hammers and drills going off from the construction across the street and the fact that English was his 2nd or 3rd language. So I assumed he didn't hear/understand me since he also asked several times to repeat our meal order.  When the bill came I asked him about the price and he said well that's why I asked you twice if you wanted that drink. It was a martini that tasted purely of $2 lillet vermouth.  That to me was a cop out because he did not ask if I saw the price of the cocktail or if I read the menu carefully. He just said oh I asked you twice.  Yea you also asked me if I wanted the quiche about 4 times so sorry I thought you just didn't understand or hear me and you rudely interrupted my conversation 3 or 4 times to do it.  Because of his dismissive attitude and arrogance  and the fact that i had no patience to argue with him at that point it will be my last time going there.  However if you chose to go please Read the prices on the drinks first.,Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

In a laughable sort of way, i came in here expecting a regular sit down brunch last sunday, when i came in for my friend's birthday. Seriously? In my defense, i wasnt having the best of days so my brain was basically on off, until i walked into this super loud, crazy energetic atmosphere with sparklers and people dancing on top of things.I literally had an ""oh yeaaaa!"" moment when i walked in. how could i be so stupid?! i walked over to my friend's table and joined the festivities. Now a lot of people are complaining about being kicked out of their table because they showed up earlier than the party, etc. I don't know exactly what time my friend and his crew got there, I would say maybe around 2ish? I walked in at 3pm, and we closed it down (it goes until about 6pm) and we were at the table the whole time. I guess the good part was that it was snowing, so i guess the party wasnt as insane as it normally is? that's what people told me when i was there at least. it was insane though. like...far more insane than i was prepared for on a snowy sunday afternoon. needless to say, my first drink was a tequila sunrise. i needed to catch up to the level everyone else was.Also, I didn't have any food. I feel like NYC is the only place you can go to brunch at and leave hungry. I was at this place for 3hrs and there was no INKLING of food anywhere near our table. I mean, people were eating. I saw them. We weren't though. Not at all. Really, I had a great time, and i wouldn't mind going back on another Sunday. Maybe at that point I can try out some of the food?",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"
175,GcN63fWDmgJgNg-noYkgkA,Annie P.,5.0 star rating,"After thinking this whole time that a brunch party involved good food and unlimited mimosas, I was blown away after experiencing my first real brunch party for my BFF Aileen W's birthday at Saturday brunch at Bagatelle.If you're here during regular brunch time, (11AM-3PM) the restaurant is appears to be a classy, fine dining experience with lounge music playing in the background.  By 3:30/4PM, the music gradually begins to get louder, the curtains close, and the real party begins.  The DJ plays a mix of top 40s/house music, everybody's dancing (they even allow dancing on the tables!), sparklers everywhere for each bottle opened, and people being carried on couches.Our whole experience was great from start to finish.  There's a variety of different dishes that are a fusion of French and American dishes -- my personal favorite was the lobster omelet.  Their drink menu is beyond extensive, especially when it came to champagnes, which ranged from a $75 bottle of Veuve to a $30,000 (!!!) bottle of Dom Perignon!  We ended up getting a few bottles of champagne and a HUGE sangria pitcher (see my photo) which was enough for 8 of us.If you don't meet the table minimum for drinks, you'll get kicked out of your table within 2 hours -- but you can move to the bar and continue the party there!  The dress code fits the typical Meatpacking District look -- trendy, swanky, and classy!The brunch party ends at 6PM.  I would recommend making the latest reservations so you will be able to enjoy the brunch party!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"
176,nT663hOPUrM_7KLunPoPyA,Carolyn L.,5.0 star rating,"Best place for boozy brunch or dinner in the Meatpacking District!! Always an amazing party for birthdays and celebrations with friends. I had 2 of my birthdays here, and they were the best and most memorable ones. Classy and sophisticated, the atmosphere is super fun, vibrant, electrifying, and full of party vibe. The food is absolutely delicious with picturesque presentations (I have been here enough times to try most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed!), and service staff is thoughtful and attentive. For boozy brunch, the party starts when all curtains close tight, and EDM music and club lights fill the space; it makes your day when you step out of the (dark, sparkler-lit) restaurant into the warm afternoon sunlight, buzzed and tipsy after an intense party brunch. For dinner, it's a dinner/clubbing/dancing hybrid. This restaurant is simply more fun and vibrant than other restaurants (with its former sister restaurant Beaumarchais coming close), and it will always have a special place in my heart!

180,6WPwcEy3xSQBGMF3RrJGCA,Oli C.,1.0 star rating,"I was genuinely looking forward to enjoying a fun brunch at Bagatelle with a big group of friends, as I had heard it is a really fun time for weekend boozy brunch. The food was ok, the service was poor, and everything (especially the alcohol) was ridiculously overpriced. And this is not even to mention the main point of this review. I had been reluctant to create a Yelp profile and write a review because I felt like it was too much work and not worth it because no one would really see it, but I have been dealing with a dispute over this brunch from 3 MONTHS ago, and feel that customers should really know the truth before going there. At the conclusion of our brunch, we split the total amount and I was given a bill for my portion, which was $1400, and told specifically that gratuity was included. So I drew a line through the space for tip, and wrote in a total of $1400. The following morning I checked online and saw a charge for $1400 for my credit card. Mysteriously, between that time and when I got my final statement for the month, the charge had magically increased to $2100. I disputed the difference of $700 through my credit card company, and actually have proof that Bagatelle wrote over my line through ""gratuity"" and gave themselves a tip of $700, and CROSSED OUT my written total of $1400 and wrote in $2100! I have never witnessed such blatant illegal fraud by a business in my life. And other members of my party were also overcharged by $700! Further, my claim was just denied by Bagatelle. I am sure that Bagatelle takes advantage of inebriated customers all the time, and have falsified bills countless times already in the past. On top of the $700 they stole from me, I just wanted to get the word out to the public that they are nothing short of con artists. My recommendation is to not go to this place, unless you want to get overcharged and ripped off.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

184,UVKr8qh_jCxknyFKohjfGg,Pasquale F.,1.0 star rating,"I haven't even gotten to the place yet & they've already left a bad taste in my mouth, I believe customer service in a restaurant is the corner stone of any establishment and it begins with the host(ess)/reservationist, that being said they are off to a bad start. My friend decided to host her birthday brunch here & she initially made a reservation for 8 people, believing reservations are generally flexible & having the common knowledge, as everyone does, that plans can sometimes change. Tonight she received a call confirming her reservation and informed whomever she spoke with that there will be an additional 2 people joining the party, this was met with a rude and an inhospitable response. They informed her that they could not possibly fit 2 more people with her group and she could not change her table count, now I can understand if she had said 4 or more additional people but only 2? We were even comfortable squeezing in. Now I don't see the point in confirming a reservation if you're not prepared for the possibility of a change of plans, in addition to this she is also unable to cancel because she was informed that she would be charged a penalty, keep in mind this is a simple brunch reservation, no contract was drawn up or signed because this is under the minimum amount of people where a brunch becomes an official prefix party, which is something I've never experienced or heard of being charged for a cancellation of a normal reservation, and I've been to many brunch dinners etc where I've never run into this situation. Per se, one of New York's finest restaurants, does not charge you for a change of plans or cancellation but BAGATELLE does?? In short, they have no concept of customer service and do not appreciate your business at all. If you're interested in a good brunch or dinner spot, I can give you a ton of recommendations that would actually be happy to have you there and from reading the rest of bagatelles reviews I can see this is not the first issue they've encountered with unhappy patrons.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

We called for the manager, which covered the back of her server. Our request call to see the wine list to check their prices was declined.

They continued to harass us to the point of getting physical with the guys we were with.

All of it sudden the manager (an Italian dude) comes out of nowhere and ruining the whole freaking moment by taking my Bf on the side for small talk. I mean come on!!! Here we are all standing and cheering and he is talking to my BF without any intentions to stop. About what?!? Apparently because my Bf happens to be an Italian too and he was handing him his business card. I made a ""please leave"" sign and he gave me a dirty look!!!  He spoiled the whole experience for every single guest of ours. There was absolutely no reason for him to approach us! Guess what Mr manager you suck at being a manager, very tactless and clumsy!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

And not just a casual brunch out with friends, but something more along the lines of this. But while you're busy taking bottles of champagne to the face, you're missing a part of Bagatelle that often goes unnoticed. The food is pretty damn good.I previously wrote about Bagatelle back in 2013 and after my latest visit I can say the food is still just as amazing. Much like Bagatelle does its brunches, they don't hold back when it comes to dinner. Dishes are French by design but kicked up a notch to meet the modern, hip vibe of this place.My recommendation is to try everything on the menu. You can't go wrong. The gnocchi made with a black truffle pesto filling and truffle sauce absolutely ooze with truffle flavor and are so rich and decadent. The Châteaubriand is a carnivore's dream next to a sky-high pile of fries.A complete list of what I sampled is below:Salade Bagatelle - hearts of lettuce, Parmesan cheese, fresh garden herbs, mustard vinaigretteGnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas - homemade gnocchi, black truffle pesto filling, truffle saucePizza à la Truffe Noire - black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamozaTartare de Thon Bagatelle - ahi tuna tartar, avocado salad, lime soy vinaigrette, taro chipsCalamari - risotto saffron cake squid ink vinaigretteChâteaubriand - Pour Deux - 24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for twoPoulet Rôti Entier à la Truffe - Pour Deux - whole truffled roasted chicken, country style potatoes, chicken jus - for twoSteak Au Poivre - black angus certified sirloin steak with homemade pomme frites and cognac classic sauceBagatelle is much more than just a weekend brunch party. The chef, Sébastien Chamaret, has developed an enticing menu that makes Bagatelle a restaurant perfect for special occasions and when you and your friends want to splurge on an incredible night out.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

As evidenced tonight. I think I have hit on the reason that this place was empty on a Wednesday night when no other restaurant in the vicinity had a table to spare... Their attitude is quite astounding. I booked a table for 5 people at 8pm. I turned up at 7pm with a friend looking for somewhere to drink for an hour. I approached the hostess and explained our situation. She asked for the name of the reservation. Looked at me disdainfully, then asked ""What is your question?""  I repeated my question, she waved at the bar area. I asked if there were any seats. She said ""I can see some seats"". I asked if there were any EMPTY seats. She waved again and said ""that is our bar"".  We went to the Ganesvort Hotel Bar... We came back at 8pm and had to introduce ourselves again. She wanted to know if our entire party was there. I lied and said yes. There was a lot of discussion in French that I understood perfectly well, but chose to ignore. We were eventually shown to our seats even though they knew we were fibbing. I find the whole ""we'll wait until your entire party is here"" bollocks so pretentious - but when their dining room is absolutely empty, I find it doubly annoying. And when they're French, that just sends me over the top. We all eventually arrived and our waiter came over. I honestly have never been served by anyone quite as lazy, entitled and arrogant. He constantly tried to up sell - offering only bottled water, champagne, $700 a bottle wine (seriously, when we asked for a recommendation they turned to the $500-$1,000 wine list.)We ordered and my friend asked for the steak with mushrooms instead of fries. When the food came - it was fries, not mushrooms that accompanied the steak. Our waiter had forgotten, but tried to bluff his way out of it by saying the chef refused to change the dish. To be fair, the food was delicious. My salmon was amazing and everyone loved what they had ordered (except the fries, they were completely soggy!). The loos were awful. They obviously hadn't been cleaned in a while, loo roll was thrown around, loos had not been flushed and NOT ONE SINGLE DOOR LOCKED! I perched on the loo with my left foot waving in the air in front of the door, ready to yell. It was most off putting.

Been here a few times and it's absolutely awesome. Aside from the fact that there's music pumping in the background and people dancing on tables, the food is delicious. At the end of the day, the food is what matters and it doesn't disappoint. The scene is what you expect in meatpacking and so are the prices. Actually, I'll go a step further and say the prices are actually higher than what you would expect in meatpacking. Expect to spend $100 bucks minimum on a brunch for two. But in return, you're getting awesome food, a fun scene and delicious drinks. I had a mojito with my breakfast made with champagne and Hennessey. Didn't know how that would work out, but it's now my morning drink of choice. I had some bananas foster French toast which was delicious. My gf had eggs Benedict and said it was also delicious.Haven't made my way here at 3am yet, but I hear it makes the brunch look like tea and crumpets.

While we made reservations and there were 9 of us, they only had a table for 4 when we arrived. Naturally, we were furious. We didn't want to ruin the day, so 4 of us sat down to eat while the rest went to the bar to wait for us to get seated at a bigger table. We ordered the food and the waiter was PAINED when I asked for a dish that was different from the other 3 girls, even pushed that I get the other dish. I stupidly consented. The hilarious part is that after all that nonsense, he still brought me the wrong dish and had to remake it (next time, just give me what I asked for to begin with)! Grrrrr!So after about an hour or so, they got us a table. As we weren't finished eating yet, we asked them to please bring the plates over to the new table. While they assured us they would be brought over, the dishes were thrown away. They apologized and said they'd bring us new ones since we weren't finished. By then, the mimosas were getting us nicely buzzed so we weren't too upset. I should mention, however, that we didn't get those new dishes until about 5 hours later when we were about to leave. I know. Unreal. The waiters are incredibly snobby and have no interest in customer service. I guess it's because their tips are already included into the check. Jerks!Anyway, onto the good ...The place closes it's shades and becomes a ""club"" during the day. Can you say awesome? We had a great time. Good food. Great drinks. Great random entertainment throughout the day. It was just a wonderful party. Everyone is dressed to the nines and having a damn good time. The best part is that by the time you leave (7:00PM-ish), it's still day time! Overall, we spent about $80 per person for food and drinks. Obviously this doesn't factor in the girls who originally got drinks from the bar, but honestly the price isn't bad at all considering that we all ate and drank all day.So, the moral of the story is that you don't come here for service, particularly GOOD or TIMELY service. The waiters are ""better than you,"" so just accept it (totally joking). What you do come here for is an incredible experience.

Definitely a once in a life experience worth balling out at (IMO) for a totally crazy NYC partying experience. The place is the mother of all boozy brunch restaurants in NYC---- every sat & sun at 3pm, they close all the window shades, dim the lights, put on the disco lights, DJ's music gets insanely loud & the place turns into a day club.I came here on two occasions.The first time, I was with a group of 6 asian girls. It was kind of late, around 4pm-5pm when people were finishing up their brunch meals. We made up some fake name at the door saying we had a reservation and got immediately in. The DJ was blasting EDM music (kaskade from time to time!), people were standing on their chairs dancing with champagne glasses in the air, swigging from giant sized moet bottles.... insane! All happening at 3pm??? There was a percussionist drummer going around the place killing it, letting some of the ladies hit a beat. Even the waiters were dancing on top of the chairs. We didn't have a table but we were dancing anyway. We didn't pay a cent!The second occasion, BF decided to throw my birthday there.Lets just say that for a group reservation of 13, our bill came out to $5000. The minimum requirement was 3000 for our party (which we obviously exceeded), but the gratuity itself was 1000+. Insane right? Ha, like I said, ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN. Felt nice to live like a queen for a day ;)Clubbing at 3pm, popping bottles........ what an experience. One waiter dressed up in a superman outfit, & two waiters carried him out while he held my giant Moet bottle & sparklers. The DJ literally stopped the music & played some grand entrance music. Superman then proceeded to swig the entire bottle into my mouth. Ultimate fail but I was a good sport about it ;)The giant sized Moet bottle they brought out had my initials on it. My Dom P bottle was illuminating beautiful. They brought out a chocolate cake with bottle sparklers. They then brought out an obnoxiously GIANT martini glass filled with icecream whipped cream & more bottle sparklers. Quite the show! ALL MY FRIENDS & everyone in the restaurant were dancing on top of chairs & having the best time of their lives.Everyone ended up leaving completely shitfaced & happy until I told them how much it was.

You're out $300 for brunch. Whoooop.On the bright side you are absolutely guaranteed to have a great, memorable experience. I would highly recommend everyone in their 20s goes to brunch here at least once while you're living in NYC. Begin your time at the bar where you will likely order one of the many drinks they offer between $17-$25 as you wait for your entire party to arrive and be seated. There are a bunch of bouncers around which is funny to see at noon. Decor is #onfleek with massive champagne bottles sprawled about. You will have multiple instagram photo opps.

So be on time and don't make friends wait lol. We ordered Sangria for the whole table and out came this huge plastic tub full of it with 12 straws sticking out. The waiters gave us a ladel for us to pour into individual glasses. That costed $400.00. The server should of poured it for us IMO. The sangria tasted really good and was sparkling. For food I ordered the Eggs Bagatelle which included 2 smoked salmon with poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce & home fries on the side. ($22.00). It tasted real good with the sangria lol.After brunch, Bagatelle turns into a day club after 3pm. All the bright lights dim and multi colored LED lights flash around. House and RnB music blasts out from the speakers and everyone is dancing. The table behind us ordered expensive bottle service and all of a sudden superman man music turns on with red and blue LEDs flashing everywhere.

I think I taste just about everything on the menu. I don't drink, but I was told the wine was fantastic.  Although everything was well prepared and presented, there were a few dishes that really stood out.I'll start with the seared sea scallop. It was perfectly cooked & I've been disappointed plenty of times with this dish elsewhere.  Fresh, tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  It melted in my mouth like butter. Now onto the black Angus steak bone in ribeye with potatoes. Better than most steakhouses I've been to! Cook to perfection. & with the one in just adds that extra flavor. Next was the seafood tower. 3 tiers of seafood heaven! Tasted like it came straight from the ocean and onto my plate. It had, clams, oysters, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, lobster, and cavier. Also had a small mix of ceviche in the center of the second tier.Lastly, the dessert. Everything imaginable to quench my sweet tooth. The giant dessert set in a ginormous martini glass. It had brownies,  cookies,  ice cream, and whip cream. I think I ate half of it all by myself, even though it's probably enough for 10 to share,  but I couldn't stop digging into it.  My experience overall was incredible.  Definitely exceeded my expectations.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

The whole idea of that seems incredibly abhorrent to me for multiple reasons but I guess thats why people go there- it's ""a party."" So when I was invited to check it out on a weekday for dinner I of course said ""yes.""And Bagatelle is legit as hell far as food goes, I must admit. Fantastic and interesting mixed drinks- the jalapeno margarita was perfecto. And the food is all super super tasty rich people versions of fast food.

Beware.Went there last night with a couple of friends, surprised the place was almost empty for being 8 PM on a Friday's Manhattanite night.We ordered an entry level wine at around 60$ because we could not find a white wine of the year, I guess they buy old lots for a discount price and then try to oversell them to their customer at the regular price. As expected the wine was awful, you can buy a better wine for 10$ at any liquor store downtown.Then we ordered the Calamari to share, nothing to share about them. Only got about 5-6oz of little-tiny calamari, and they smelled like cheese. How where they cooked? I could not tell since we had to light our Iphone led flashes to read the menu as the space was loud and dark.Main courses where also a disaster, my wife ate the duck, which make her spit some of the pieces because they were all nerve.The 'best' part came when we tried to order our desserts. A busboy approached us to offer desserts (which really surprised me), offering us a 'sandy' as we were hesitant to decide. We agreed and then he also offered the profiteroles. We also agreed as we had not enjoyed the dinner at all. We were 4, so we thought it would be wise to share two desserts.After a long wait, they bring us a huge mountain of whipped cream covering chocolate and vanilla ice-cream, the portion suited for a party of 10 or more people. We were astonished when we realized we were being cheated. To end the con they charged us 55$ for this horrendous mess of sugar, that remained almost intact as we left the place. We could not fully realize the trick until we got the check, as the con was not displayed in the menu.Not happy about this the waiter complained about his little tip, and suggested it was our fault to have ordered the desserts to the busboy (as we were telling he was the one that came to our table to ask, and offered the con).

Had I paid full price for these this review would be worse. Service struggles to get a 2 - I'm not sure I've had worse in NYC. This was a quiet Monday night and the main server only seemed to be attending 2 tables yet seemed to, at times, just forget there table existed (aside from serving v expensive bottled water). 2 stars simply because the service seemed incompetent rather than rude.

It was a great vibe and club brunch.  We each spent over $220 on brunch which is a BIT pricey in my opinion... so I'm not raging to come back anytime soon but would recommend it as an experience to try in NYC at least once !",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

First of all the cuntarella answering the phones was the rudest thing alive, but I get it. You're pumpin', you're busy, you're stressed... WhateverAnyway, so we arrive (party of six, all girls, birthday) and were seated at the corner of the restaurant. We were surrounded by the tackiest people alive. Seriously, the website made it look like one would be hanging with the hip crowd of the Hampton's elite, but instead we got jersey shore dressed up in wannabe prep attire. I stress wannabe. I suppose that's not the restaurants fault. Anyway, we get seated by the windows, and immediately it felt like we were seated in front of an icebox. There was ZERO heat in that corner for some reason. (We were all in heals & frozen under the table, not cute) we complained about it a few times, so that they could possibly turn the heat up but we got nothing. Let's move on to the food. It took them about an hour to just get the ORDER in, quite simply because the server kept wandering off. The food finally arrives and it seriously tasted like GARBAGE. Seriously, no love went into my over cooked eggs Benedict with supermarket powder bought hollandaise sauce. We decide to carry on, ignore the food, get toasty... Order desert maybe.... Except our server is yet again no where to be found... They cleared our plates, but our server was M-I-A, he finally shows up. We order drinks and asked look at the desert menu. He takes the order and responds with  ""sure, I'll get the menus, I'll be right back.""  The man disappears......At this point a couple of us got up to complain about it. They try to remedy the situation by serving us a round of shots, an enormous Sunday (AFTER WE ORDERED DESERT) and bringing a local heater to the table. Which was nice I suppose but it only took them 3 hours, and a complaint to get their act together.The ""entertainment"" was garbage as well. Again, we were there for three hours and the only thing they did was turn the lights off and play music from Brazil. Whenever we'd ask when the real party was starting. They'd reply. THE DJ IS EATING.....The tab came and it was insane. Seriously. Which honestly, would not have bothered me had there been actual service, actual food and less tacky people to be around.Never again.

I asked the server what I should get- The Salmon, the Wagyu, or the Filet. He told me to go with the Wagyu. It came out and everyone's food looked amazing. It was presented nicely. Mind you this place is not cheap, I expect the ""you get what you pay for situation.""I started cutting it, fine. This first bite was the chewiest steak I've ever eaten in my life. It was actually really hard to swallow. I thought maybe its just the end piece, went to the second sliver, chewier than ever. Honestly I've had better steak at a TGI Fridays and no I'm not exaggerating. My fiance is a huge steak buff, who also got the Wagyu. His boss also got the Wagyu, I leaned over and asked them what they thought. They both HATED it, but being guys they decided to fight through it and not say anything. My fiance's friend almost choked to death. It took the server a really long time to come over to me (everyone else was completely done with their meals)  I ended up telling him I honestly can't eat it. (Which I have NEVER send back food, ever) I told him how chewy it was and he said, yea it's supposed to be. Really haha? No, Wagyu is not supposed to taste like a rawhide dog bone. But this time, being that I am spending a couple hundred dollars in one dinner, I would really enjoy a decent meal so I asked him to take it back. At this point I didn't even want anything anymore, my friend let me try her salmon and that was really good. So they rushed a Salmon out for me, still pretty awkward to have to eat in front of 12 people who have been finished for a while, whatever. I would go back but long story short, don't get ANY Steak.

Didn't expect that she picked out such a upscale fancy place but thanks to yelp, I did my research and dressed to the nine compared to two of my friends who weren't as prepared for this place! Heck, we all had such a blast anyways. If you wanna really do it up big for a great day time experience on your birthday, and don't mind having the money to blow... This is your place to be.So let me give you an idea on how the prices runs for drinks&food...$400 for one huge tub of Sangria(Mega Rose Sangria); we got two of that for the 6 of us to turn up.$84 for six sex on the beach shots.$15 for truffle fries side on the table to share$19 for tuna tartare to share$20 for two jugs of sparkling water$20-$30 for each brunch entree we ordered.$55 for one big birthday sundae.Due to previous reviews, I had low expectations on the food thinking this is just some effortless cooked food for the overpriced cost to this upscale name... Well yes, the food is pretty overpriced but I really have nothing bad to say about the food at all. The truffle fries were so good and my favorite out of all the brunch dish was probably the Nutella French toast! It ain't top notch par but it's really not bad either. Plus who needs food when you have all those drinks and your body is too busy bumpin to the music?We came 15 minutes late to our 2:30 reservation and got seated right at 3pm. The bouncers and servers may seem really snotty at first.. But when it came through the party, they're actually very friendly and engaging... Must be a French thing oh my. So it's a classy ambience with bright lights and chandeliers in the beginning. Once it hits 4, the curtains close and the lights start to dim down, the music gets louder, led lights lit on and suddenly people are standing on their chairs dancing away to the vibe. Soon, my girls wanted actual hard liquor... And I think this classy upscale place is strictly only a Champagne Brunch type. Hence the fact we received 6 sex on the beach shots, even though we were really expecting regular vodka shots. Each time we kept asking if they had regular bottle of vodka of some sort they either said sure and never got back to us or dodged the question. They didn't bother giving us the memo that it's only a champagne kind of brunch... Oops. Should've figured though from seeing only champagne on the menu. Fine, we'll order a second $400 Mega Rose Sangria.Our tab? About $1400 between us 6 girls. Isn't the birthday girl lucky she doesn't get to pay? Of course. Almost $300 from each of us for this bougie boozy brunch. I guess I'll be eating instant cup noodles for the next few days... Jk...

The charcuterie was an embarrassment, with frozen pate and prosciutto that was dry and  had obviously been sitting around for a while. The duck confit was dry, bland and tasteless. The lobster macaroni and cheese had no discernible lobster, which left one with a very pricey mac n' cheese. Their signature dish, the Nutella French toast lived up to the hype.

My sister ordered a mojito and I had a caipirinha, the total of those drinks were $34. Come with your wallet full, or already drunk if you really want to have a good time. The music was great, and I found myself constantly questioning why this formula was working while I couldn't understand it.

They've got great lighting, great music, and the wait staff/bar staff were all gorgeous. They rely on gimmicks to get the crowd riled up, but they're fun not cheesy.

I then pulled out a picture on my phone of myself at my birthday, at bagatelle brunch, a few months earlier, holding one of their ""signature cocktails"" and showed it to him. He just repeated that you can only order bottles and ignored me having caught him lying. If you are four people each drinking something different, you don't want to be limited to just drinking rose or a completely disgusting fishbowl.2. With a 2pm brunch reservation, you will be seated at 3:30pm- yet they tell you that you will lose your table if you don't check in your entire party by 2pm. This long wait applies to everyone. The place waits until it hits critical mass before it seats anyone. So even if the tables are empty, bussed, and ready, you need to wait until they are comfortable that the place will look ""full""3. They are desperately trying to save money by cutting corners. It comes through on very embarrassing little things, like not bringing out enough ketchup or claiming to run out of items they clearly just never stocked in the first place.4. They claim to run out of a LOT of items on the menu. Since there are basically only two waves of seatings (early brunch goers and party brunch goers), it is highly unlikely they already ran out (or indeed had it in the first place) and it most likely has to do with them trying to save money (see point 3).5. This is obviously the worst aspect, but it is nothing new unlike the other points. They will try to get you out of there as soon as possible. They will take away any bottles that are 80% empty, they will bus any plates that are 80% eaten- the second your fork comes down, they will take your plate. Their business model is to clear the table so they can get someone in from the bar to order bottles while there is still enough time left in the party. While this is no surprise and I understand why they do it, it is soo stressful and uncomfortable if you are a customer. And they are completely shameless and utterly aggressive about it.6. I have no idea what the deal is with this, but it smells like an open sewage pipe in front of the entrance. This may have nothing to do with them, but where the unfortunate bouncers are standing, it literally smells like human feces.

I may have a different experience if I join Bagatelle for Brunch. The atmosphere is on point and I would definitely recommend anyone to come for the great music and spectacular nightlife it offers.

263,TeeKROxBnMjMSprN4V5w_Q,Marland V.,2.0 star rating,"For the purpose of this review and not to be biased, I will give them 2 stars rather than the 1 star they deserve. I'll first start with some of the highlights of my day there (Sunday brunch):1) The lobster mac and cheese was actually good. Nice balance of cheese and lobster. Not extremely heavy.2) I also tasted the eggs benedict and that was also tasty. Not the best I've had but definitely a good quality (small portion though for both lobster mac and eggs).Let's now move onto the service, It started out decent. We ordered a few bottles for the table and then ordered our entrees. Some of us ordered coffees as well. The waiters definitely tend to rush you out as they want big spenders at the tables. Mind you, every single one of us ordered an entree and then dessert as well. (along with 2 bottles for the table)Anyways, everything seemed to be going well. We finished at around 2:30 p.m. and they informed us of the time limit on the table. That was still fine and we moved to the bar area. We ordered drinks and kept ordering. Eventually our friend decided to close his tab and asked the bartender 3 times to close it.You know how they say third times the charm; well the waiter proved that wrong! He ignored my friend's request 3 times (mind you he wrote that he wants to close the tab ON HIS iPHONE yet the bartender ignored him and took shots). Ok, fine, so my friend being the nice guy that he is decides to go to the manager.He waited about a half hour for the manager just to talk to him and only then (after ONE HOUR) he gets his card back and the receipt to sign. Due to the lack of respect and the way the situation was handled, my friend doesn't include any tip and in the place of numbers, writes a phrase that rhymes with LUCK TOO (use your imagination). The bartender wasn't happy and informs the manager who then informs a bouncer to escort him out of the restaurant.So let's be honest with ourselves for a moment; my friends and I are not snobs at all yet for whatever reason we were treated so. The food is decent, the music is usually upbeat, there's a ton of girls who party there that go by the name of Molly, and if you've ever seen Cougartown, well this place makes it look like a college sorority with the amount of married women getting drunk. Manhattan is quite a large place and there are many restaurants in it's vicinity that do not force their patrons to leave their table at a specified time or charge extra if a person is missing from the reservation or force a table to buy ""extra premium"" items if they wish to stay. Will I be coming back here; perhaps if a friend decides to throw a bash here. But I will be seeking other venues that deserve my money for my own plans.P.S.-If you're a hostess in a place like this, and even if a patron gets you ticked off because they made a negative comment about a restaurant you simply work in, it doesn't give you the right to curse them out in your broken English. Even if you are European...remember that.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

Kicked out that is if you don't spend $1,300 for a bottle of champagne. No joke we got hustled out IN THE MIDDLE OF DESSERT because they needed the table. Mind you we know for a fact we were singled out. Our waitress was over heard saying ""why did you chose them?!"" I need to add they we were not being keepos. At this point out bill was already over $500 and we tried to order an additional $300 bottle of champagne. That is when we were given the same menu with the same bottles just double to price and told we could only stay if we ordered a $1,300 bottle. We were with our French friends so I feel like we should have been respected more and they tried to hustle the birthday hostesses and that was crossing the line.It's sad.

In my experience, that is pretty rare in a place with as many excellent options as Manhattan, especially in the Meatpacking District.All in all, I had a practically perfect experience at Bagatelle, and can't wait to go back again the next time I'm in town.  Hopefully I can get a table!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

The food was lackluster at best -especially given that they are charging for a fine dining experience, which this certainly was not. Both the beef and the lobster were woefully overcooked. The chicken tasted as if it had been par-cooked earlier that morning or possibly even the day before. Dousing it with beef gravy did little to resurrect the dry, dead bird. The texture of the skin was rubbery and nearly impossible to cut, even with the blunted steak knives they had provided. The epic struggle to dissect the various meats made for a real comedy of errors as we fought to keep our drinks upright while the wobbly table shook violently under the effort. We waited an inordinate amount of time for our server at every turn. He took 40 minutes just to take our drink orders. The waiter's customer service skills, or more aptly lack there of, were an unmitigated failure. He had to literally be chased down to serve our table. And once he was reached, his blasé attitude left us feeling frustrated and abandoned. This same aloofness pervaded the hostesses as well. I believe the perfunctory gratuity added to the bill encourages their server's casual dereliction of duty. Finally, the celebratory giant dessert dish, which was meant to be the crowning glory of the evening was pitiful, with the exception of the giant sparkler that accompanied it. This abomination essentially consisted of a giant mountain of whipped cream and other nondescript filler items, with barely a smattering of ice cream. 95% of it remained on the table along with the acrid stench lingering from the sparkler, as a monument to the sad, pitiful culinary defeat we had the displeasure of bankrolling that evening.

I made reservations exactly 1 month in advance for my birthday dayclub brunch and even then was stuck with the last 1pm reservation. The actual club portion of the brunch begins sometime around 3pm, but they don't allow reservations that late because at that point it's up to the discretion of the bouncers (and it really is! I had a friend attempt to join us around 4pm, but was turned away at the door because she had just come from a day of studying and was wearing sweats, womp!). We had a party of 8 girls, and even with the classic ""tell them the reservation is 30 mins earlier than it actually is,"" people were laaaaate. At the same time, Bagatelle was having several issues clearing a table for us, so we ended up waiting around 40 mins or so to be seated. However, it was definitely worth the wait as we ended up right next to Mr. DJ! We were also in front of the velvet curtain windows where passerbys attempt to catch a glimpse of the craziness that is Bagatelle!Once seated, the waiters really tried to push the bottles list, full of magnum sized bubbly! Initially I was tempted, but in the end we all ordered several cocktails instead. The cocktails were all delicious and oh so pretty! The food itself is decent enough brunch grub, clocking in at $16 average. The gnocci though is TDF, amazingly decadent and melt in yo mouth! Yum. By 3pm, the DJ started amping up the music, playing around with the crazy lights, and the curtains were closed. People started getting up on the chairs to groove while a funky guy in a head-to-toe body suit came around shoving free shots down our throats and letting us swing the Bagatelle flag over our heads. Then several models walked around in their Marie Antoinettte get-ups, complete with over the top wigs, posing for photos. My girls capped off the day with a huge ice cream dessert, topped off with my very own sparkler! Thanks ladies (:Highly recommend Bagatelle for a crazy (yet expensive) Sunday Funday. Remember to make reservations or you'll be stuck with the hundreds of other people at the bar. Compared with Beaumarchais, I felt that the people at Bagatelle were definitely easier on the eyes, and the venue was a lot larger.

Basically you sit eat brunch with friends and have lots of mimosas till the lights go out and music starts pumping. You feel like your in a night club at 2 in the afternoon. Every time I have been here I've had a tun of fun. Aside from the fun atmosphere the food is amazing. My favorite is the Nutella French toast, any girls comfort food right there. The best is when you order a bottle to your table, your server is carried through the air to Star Wars music while holding your bottle and a sparkler - pretty hilarious. The only downfall about this place is the door man can sometimes be selective on who he lets in and they won't take reservations during that time.

The meal was a hit with my table of four.  Two indulged in the price fixe menu and feasted on lamb and perfectly cooked scallops respectively. I opted to share a whole fish (a massive snapper to be exact). It was presented, deboned and cut table side and was a standout dish that I'd definitely come back for.  Oh then the desserts, you couldn't forget those if you tried - chocolate mousse, peaches and cream, a nouveau version of a tart, and a salted caramel plate that was to die for perfectly capped off what I'd consider a perfect meal.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

All of the ingredients blended well together. Drink wise my glass of wine was very reasonably priced. My friends sangria and Bellini were a bit high. $22 a glass for a Bellini is nuts, even for the city. The service was very attentive and friendly.

309,kaJlCN_CKIEZ_sq0_0mWTQ,Ken L.,2.0 star rating,"First of all, Bagatelle is really a club that serves food, so really depends on what you're going there for. Going for the food? Skip it. The food sucks and the place is so loud it's impossible to talk over dinner. I've been twice. Both times the food was not good. This past time, we made a reservation a week in advance and they made us wait an hour for our table. We put up with it because it was Saturday night and at that point our options were limited to go elsewhere. Going to party? It's can be a fun place for sure. The music is loud, but very good. Service - Once you're seated, the service is very fast. Unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. They try and sell you as much as possible and serve you as fast as possible to either run up your tab or get you out of there. The staff is trained to be very pushy and up-sell you as much as possible. You order a glass of champagne, they try and sell you a bottle. You order a bottle, they try and sell you a magnum. You stop ordering booze and they keep pushing you to order more. If the waiter isn't successful in selling you more, the manager stops by and gives it a shot. This has happened to us on both occasions and this is after we bought multiple bottles of high end wine and champagne. Very obnoxious to say the least. My advice. If you want to check it out, just go in for a drink at the bar before committing to the entire ""experience"".

Oh boy was I sad about it.  I arrived later than expected and didn't get a chance to order food. But it looked amazing and I actually did try a bite of the pancakes, they were darn good. I also tried a bit of the the gigantic birthday sundaes that was on the table. Not bad at all. What I loved most was the service. I don't know if it was just that day and we got lucky to have such an awesome group of waiters but they were really sweet after I guess putting up a bit of a fuss about adding extra seating. They were very attentive and into pleasing the bday girl. They allowed us to go over our time to have the table. The waiters also gathered her gifts and placed them in a safe spot as well as made space at the bar for all of us to enjoy the brunch party. So I'll admit I was thinking hmmm this party may not be fun, given the district. But when the music started, the lights dimmed, champagne bottles started flowing, the dancers and live drummer started and people began to dance on tables I was like welp I was wrong. I danced non-stop until it was time for me go. We even got a chance to dance and jam with the drummer. I left at 4:20pm and it was already live. My pal had a marvelous time and that's all that really mattered since it was her show. My only complaint would be that it gets cramped near the bar area for the brunch party and  if you want space to dance it can be limiting as the waiters are back and forth with orders.

I made a reservation on February 5, 2016 for a party of seven for my 24th birthday which is February 20th. A week or so later I called back to edit the reservation and add one guest making for a total of eight people. I then received a confirmation email for my reservation of eight guests on February 20 at 2:30 PM. A week or so before the date of my reservation, I received a phone call to confirm which I had missed and they left me a voicemail. I called back to confirm thinking that if they didn't hear from me they would possibly cancel my reservation. When I called back my reservation was confirmed and everything was set for February 20th. The day came and I arranged a limousine to take my friends and I into the city so that no one would have to drive. We got to the restaurant and were immediately told that there was no reservation for us. While standing outside I called the corporate office, and they confirmed my reservation. The doorman however refused to let us in and kept insisting that our reservation was not there and that they were wrong at the corporate office. I then called the office back and requested to have them speak to the doorman. After walking in the restaurant with my phone, he came out and told me that they agreed with him and that indeed I had no reservation. I got back on the phone and asked them how that could be when I had just called and it was confirmed. After waiting on hold and being hung up on twice someone finally forwarded a copy of the reservation as seen on the computer in the corporate office to my phone. Finally a manager came out whose name escapes my mind, however he was not helpful at all and was actually quite rude. He was not at all accommodating and kept saying there was nothing he could do that the restaurant was at capacity. He told me I had the wrong day and that I was confused and that there was nothing he could do. When I showed him my confirmation email and copy of the reservation from corporate he had nothing to say. When I got home that evening I called corporate to complain. The woman I spoke to on the phone (marisol I believe) apologized multiple times and told me that she would have a manager get back to me, which never happened. I called back three times after the initial phone call to complain and still have not heard a word back. Clearly this is something that must happen often as nobody really cared. After this experience I can say for sure that I will never return to this establishment. In addition all of the women in my party will not be returning as well. We have never felt more embarrassed, being left standing on a street corner all dressed up with nowhere to go.

The Service: 3.5Pretty friendly server, really feel bad for these Euro guys as they seem to hate their job since they usually have to serve severely wasted people and try to avoid getting smacked in the face as the patrons are dancing.

Went there for brunch and was ushered in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour. The music was incredibly loud and you felt like you were inside of a rather trashy and loud nightclub at 12AM on a Sunday morning. The food was bland-- not even sure the truffles I paid $50 for on a couple of slimey scrambled eggs were real. There was absolutely no taste. Additionally, the service was rude and rushed us throughout-- not even letting us finish our over priced and watered down sangrias before telling us it was time to leave because people were waiting (40 minutes into eating!!! And mind you, it took 30 minutes for the food to even get there).

Fourth of July was bound to be a slow weekend but I booked a table a few days in advance anyway and got a 12:30pm reso. Seated fairly promptly. Food was surprisingly good despite the high prices. Champagne prices are pricey yes, but not bad actually when compared to club pricing. It's definitely cheaper in line with restaurant prices. 12:30 the music was loud and the crowd lively but behaved. 2:30 we finished and got drinks at the bar. Around 3, the party progressively got rowdier. Then at 3:15 the curtains close and its full on club. Sparklers and bottles and a lot ladies both young and old dancing. Fun time. Next time I'll probably book earlier and get a table around 2:30 so I can enjoy more of the party and less of the brunch.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

We were first looking to go to a rooftop bar, but when we past by this place, we were intrigued and looked inside. When we had a peek of this place, we knew that this was the place to have a drunk brunch. We got there kind of late, so our bottle service was at the bar since they ran out of tables. Nonetheless, it was still a great experience. What pretty much is a fancy place to have brunch. This place definitely has a French theme and is well decorated and clean. The restrooms are downstairs and is clean as well. There is one main bar that is next to the dance area. There are plenty of speakers and the EDM and hip hop music leads to a really rowdy afternoon. The windows are covered by blinds to make this place feel like your in a nightclub.The bouncers and bartenders are very nice. The bartenders were attentive and quickly made our drinks. The bartenders are active, not only do they serve drinks, they also spray fire extinguisher at the crowd without any warning. So when they do,  cover your drinks! Other than that, the environment is insane and people get crazy dancing on top of chairs and tables. Overall, this is a place that is very fun and crazy!

It was a pretty good evening, however I do not see myself returning here next time I am in New York.When we finally got seated our table was uneven (one part taller than the other) because they pushed two two-tops together to make a six top. We had to ask several times for the problem to be fixed and got different answers each time, ranging from ""nothing I can do"" to ""someone will take care of this"". I understand that a problem like this could arise if we were a walk up but having made the reservation 4 weeks in advance, I expected better planning. I have to give it to them, they did swap the table that was causing the trouble (the replacement was wobbly but we didn't care anymore). Again, this may not seem like a big deal but when you pay for nye dinner in advance, you expect more.The food was pretty tasty, especially the caviar! But I did feel like the portions could have been just a tad bigger. But overall, I was full and happy! Two problems with service related to food: The wait staff was very eager to take our plates away and we had to remind them that the prefixe menu included a champagne toast at midnight (we were asked whether we wanted to order champagne).The party part was great with awesome music. I won't complain about the prices of alcohol because I am sure they are pretty standard across all establishments like this. The one thing I would recommend to bagatelle for pre fixe menus: if you going to charge two weeks ahead for this meal, please include the tax and tip at that time.

There was a lot of goat cheese overwhelmingly so. We did order their fries which were delicious as well as the nutella french toast. The Nutella French Toast was absolutely amazing. There was a lot of it and it was delicious with a ton of nutella and some raspberry spread as well. Then around 4pm or so, our food was removed, the lights dimmed even more and the music got louder. People started getting on their chairs and seats and it turned into a club (similar to Lavo Brunch). We ordered their big bottle of champagne that came with a massive ice cream sundae with the waiter bringing it as darth vader but nobody ate the sundae and opted for the champagne instead (obviously). The music was good but less rowdy than Lavo for example. Once 6mp rolled by, all the customers left...into the daylight completely wasted. tl;dr It's a great atmosphere and a thing that people should do at least once. However if you're going to do a club brunch, I prefer Lavo.

The space was nice and clean with crisp white walls and cushioned leather seats along with a bar aligned against the wall. Once we were seated we were greeted with a friendly and upbeat gesture by our awesome waiter....We ordered the fishbowl for about $150 which served 6 of us...the drinks were delicious and with equal parts of top shelf liquor which made it worth the $150. I myself had the Eggs Benedict with a side of spinach and a side of truffle fries.....This definitely tops as one of the best Eggs benedict I've had in a while!!!! The hollandaise sauce was dripped to perfection and the spinach was perfectly seasoned!!!! All throughout brunch the energy level was on high which gave me an indication that the weekly brunch party was about to get into full swing...as I scooped the last bite into my mouth the wailing and roaring of the speakers went from 10 to 1000 and the lights went out and into full club mode..In comes the crowd, floods the dance floor and at this point get ready to sweat your behind off....a great setting to work off that brunch you just indulged in ....all in all, I would definitely go back for a summer party and hope for the same service and tasty brunch!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

With locations in Los Angeles, St. Barth's, Las Vegas, the reopening of the flagship location was inevitable.You'll find yourself completely in the South of France with their Mediterranean menu and interior. We even recognized some waiters from our favorite places in Cannes. Apart from their delicious dishes, they also have a fabulous cocktail bar with a whole lot of creative cocktails inspired by the ones you get at the Côte d'Azur. And for me as an non-alcoholic, the cute bartender brewed me the most incredible virgin cocktails.  But the most fun are the popular brunches here on saturdays and sundays. Between 12 and 1 noon the crowd starts trickling in. Until 3 pm you can enjoy the food with good music to sing-along, but after that the place dims the lights, closes the curtains, music turns up and the and the party is on!

So, when we arrived at 2:05 and this bouncer told us we had no reservation, we were shocked to say the least. After a few minutes of arguing with the bouncer, his final statement was, and a I quote, "" Listen, I don't know what to tell you, but it just isn't happening. There's no room"". Mind you... The place wasn't packed, groups of men and even larger parties were being seated as we were standing outside in the freezing cold. Bagatelle is truly a disgrace. Plain and simple.

We got the large truffle gnocchi ($36) and albeit good, there were probably 10 pieces of gnocchi in the whole dish. Tuna tartare was good ($19). Australian wagyu was good but nothing special ($45). Top this off with truffle fries ($15), Brussel sprouts ($9), and a couple of drinks and your set back $250 after tip and tax.

I had the steak frites, which cost me $45 but was worth it and perfect to split, and some truffle fries that will make you cream your panties. In order to keep our table after we finished eating, we were told we'd need to spend $1,400 minimum on champagne. After some back and forth with the tiny french man who manages the place, he agreed to let us get obliterated on vodka instead.

The waiter was very up-front about us having a limited time to order and eat (2 hours) as they needed to seat other people. That said, the wait staff is friendly and helpful and will call you things like ""Love"" and ""Gorgeous."" Ours kept coming over with free shots after the party started, which was cool. The food is good, they aren't reinventing the wheel with any of their dishes, but I definitely enjoyed it. And the drinks are great too, especially some of their specialty cocktails. Before the party starts it's your regular upscale brunch place. White tablecloths, everyone dressed up, moderately low noise level. Once we left our table and got to the (very crowded) bar, the party started. They close the blinds, colorful lights come on, a DJ starts playing music, dancers take to the tables and people dressed up in costumes--boxers, Spiderman, etc.--come out to party. It's crowded and gets very hot once everyone starts to dance, so ladies make sure you can shed some layers. If you order a bottle of champagne they make a huge deal out of it, crowd-surfing a costumed character over to open it, sparkles ablaze and all. Dancing is permitted anywhere, even though waiters are still shuffling huge trays of food around.It was definitely a lot of fun--everyone is there to party. But it's expensive, expect to pay $15 or more for even simple drinks like a vodka soda. Brunch entrees average around $25. I'd say it's definitely worth going once, especially if it's not something you'd normally do.

403,89l7ir4KwqCPDCpH9WvCnA,Benazir A.,3.0 star rating,"So I'm not exactly sure how to review this place. In terms of the food I would definitely NOT return. It is way over-priced for what it is. We were a bigger group (ten people) so I tried several different things. The steak was not impressive, and the chicken was a bit flavorless. This would of course be okay if the place wasn't charging an arm and a leg for their food. On the other hand the gnocchi was great as was the tuna tartare. We got two bottles of wine, neither was anything to write home about.I will say though that the place has a great concept. It's like a fun house for adults. People dancing on tables, popping bottles of champagne. Again, all this comes with a price. I would estimate that if you were to get appetizers, entrees, drinks and a bottle of wine the bill would come to 150-200 a person. While the venue is fun and the music is good, the mediocre food doesn't justify the prices. (Regardless though, I was and am very grateful for my generous company who introduced me to this place) I'd recommend going somewhere else for dinner if you plan on dropping that kind of money. I've heard this place is really great for Sunday brunch; if in the near future I'm in the mood for a splurge I may consider giving it another shot, till then though I think the above is a fair assessment.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

I called to make reservations about a month in advanced because i knew i was going with a big party. Rude lady on the phone who barely understood a word i was saying told me they don't accept reservations that far in advanced. Funny, because for a place that acts like who they hell they are, they should be able to take reservations months in advanced if it's THAT great....but that's not the point. Was told to call back 2 weeks before the date so i did. Made reservations for my birthday for a party of 10 girls. Was running a little late due to traffic in the city because of a fair on 6th avenue. Called to let them know i was running late, but a few of my friends may be there before me. Didn't give me a hard time over the phone. My friends get there before me and they refused to seat them because reservation was in my name & i wasn't there yet as well as the complete party. A few minutes go by and my friends are calling me non stop asking where i am because the hostess is threatening to give up my table. Interesting how they had the nerve to threaten to give away a reservation for a party of 10 girls for a birthday. Finally i arrive and the party is complete. The rude hostess drops the bomb on me that i only have my table for an hour and a half due to other reservations after us. Well maybe if you didn't book reservations on top of each other, you wouldn't have to throw people out. We sit down near the window which was absolutely freezing because of a draft coming through the cracks of the door. Such a high end place, maybe they should invest some money into getting doors that fit correctly into the damn frame. Anyway, our waiter was one of the rudest waiters I've ever had. This guy did not have a smile on his face & had an attitude from the get go. My sister spoke to the manager, who was some bald guy in a zoot suit walking around like he shit out money. Tells my sister those are the rules (hour & a half limit) because they are busy and other people are waiting for our table. told her if you plan on spending a lot of money ""then we'll talk"". Last time i spent close to 2Gs among 6 girls. Really didn't like the disrespect this time, in which you don't even know how much we are willing to spend this time. FUCK YOU.Took our waiter about 20 minutes to take our order, which if i'm being ""timed"" to eat & drink, you should take my order 5 minutes after i sit down. We get our food; no complaints there. Once we were done eating & drinking, we were handed the bill & told only way we can stay at the table is if we buy a bottle of Cristal, otherwise we have to stand at the crowded bar. We weren't even asked if we wanted anything else, we were just demanded to get up & relocate to the bar. RUDE.Waiter told us at the bottom of the confirmation email, it says i have a 1 hour and 30 minute limit at the table. We pulled up the email and there was nothing that stated that. Brought it to his attention that he's basically a liar & he went to go ""talk"" to someone. Came back saying it's an error & it should say that, but regardless. we have to leave the table.Funniest part of this whole experience is as we're walking out, we bump into a nice ""GRADE PENDING"" sign in the window. When i log onto the health dept website to see why their grade is pending, it says as of 12/13/13, they had  a C rating due to ""Food worker does not wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet, coughing, sneezing, smoking, eating, preparing raw foods or otherwise contaminating hands."" i am a certified food handler & for anyone who is unaware, a C is basically a step away from being shut down. just a little FYI.I will never give this place another penny. They don't deserve it, they are rude, they have no patience at all & they treat you like they're better than you. For a place that's so ""high class & upscale"", maybe they should invest some money into expanding their restaurant so people don't have to get thrown off their table like my friends & i did. Overpriced, rude, unfriendly, & stuck up describes this place. Good luck running your business with a bunch of disgusting staff & deplorable management.

Of course it was an added bonus that our waiter was a cute Frenchie that arrived here a month ago! Too bad I forgot his name.

We had the flatbread and calamari to start along with the roasted chicken and salmon- SO GOOD. Also the creamy garlic butter they serve with the bread is so delicious.

409,1BgIC9ulBZhS_NV8V2Kh2Q,Brendan M.,5.0 star rating,"OK, so a five star rating is pretty serious. This is true. But I've been here something like 5 times now and its always perfect. The chefs back there are as talented as they come. Have to be French guys. I've had the Dover Sole twice and although its not cheap at $68.00, the dish is simply divine. Fileted and deboned tableside with delicious sides that come with it. The grass fed, organic, bone-in filet mignon is simply INSANE. I didn't know meat could taste like that. Succulent, fork-tender, creamy, buttery - almost a hint of foie gras. They had just received an order of rare, Italian black truffles from Piedmont and you could have them shave some on top for an extra $20.00. The ambience is relaxed, refined, elegant, funky-cool and romantic. They always have a DJ sorting out the tunes which are always a fresh mix of old and new choice tracks. The sound system was clearly sourced and installed by a complete pro because the mix is perfect in any seat and they strategically placed sub-woofers along the bench seating so when it gets a bit later and they turn up the juice a little, you can feel the base in your seat. Tellement Cool. Most, but not all, of the servers are French dudes - from France - and there's a special kind of cool that comes with being a young, hip, French guy who loves food and wine. I've never had a server I didn't want to become friends with. My only critique would be that it does tend to attract a lot of giggly, bachelorette party chicks looking for Wall Street cats to buy them drinks and diamonds or whatever they find important. But I've been pretty fortunate and it hasn't impeded my enjoyment too much. Classic place.

410,hoP8m8GNjhMBCY4zrR91VQ,Yael M.,5.0 star rating,"While you're not going to be particularly frugal if you go to Bagatelle for dinner, I felt very welcome upon walking in the front door. What first caught my eye was all of the 'out there' art that adorned the walls of the restaurant. It was highly entertaining.I decided to get my own party started with a Girl from Lima ($14), a cocktail combining jalapeno infused pisco, passion fruit puree, lemon juice and mint. Because I neglected to read the ""jalapeno infused"" part, I was a little shocked at how spicy this drink was and didn't think I'd be able to finish it. However, I warmed to it, and would highly recommend it!I don't know about you, but when I typically go out to dinner, I don't order the entire menu, but at this awesome event, they practically sent out everything the kitchen was cooking up. For appetizers, we had the Pizza a la Truffe Noir with black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza ($22); the charcuterie board ($24) which came with a variety of house-cured meats and whole grain mustard; Salade Bagatelle with hearts of lettuce, parmesan cheese, fresh garden herbs, and mustard vinaigrette ($13); Tartare aux Deux Saumons ($17/$25) fresh & smoked Scottish salmon tartar, shallot, salmon caviar, dill crème fraiche, olive oil crostini; Haricots Verts et Canard Fumé string beans, radicchio, smoked duck prosciutto, truffle vinaigrette ($18); foie gras creme brulee (off-menu); and finally the Tartare de Thon Bagatelle ($19/$29) ahi tuna tartar, avocado salad, lime soy vinaigrette, taro chips.My favorites were both of the tartares, although I always favor salmon. The fish was fresh and super flavorful. I was very intrigued by the foie gras creme brulee, but I still concede that foie gras is an acquired taste. Hence, I only had a couple of bites as it was very rich, but I would definitely say it's worth a try. The salad was simple and fresh, but I might opt for one of their other more creative salads next time. The truffle pizza was OMG amazing and not just because I like anything with truffle.After all that, I honestly thought that was the entire dinner and was ready to put on the coats and head home. But no! Chef Sébastien came out to answer questions and explain a bit about his background in preparation for the main courses. Yes, plural main courses, because, why not?I'll start with the pasta and fish dishes. First we had more truffles (!) with the Gnocchi Truffes à la Parisienne de Nicolas ($25/$36) homemade gnocchi, black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce; Calamars Snackes au Beurre Aille ($18) sautéed calamaris, tomato confit, polenta fritter, garlic butter; Coquilles St.Jacques Rôties au Parmesan ($36) thyme & parmesan crusted scallops, artichokes mousseline, cabernet demi-glace; and the Filet de Saumon Sauvage Grillé ($28) grilled wild salmon filet, asparagus hollandaise sauce.I could have eaten the entire vat of gnocchi, no joke, it was that good. Do you SEE the giant truffle shavings spread over the top?!?! Other favorites from this course were the onions that accompanied the salmon. Yes, the salmon was good to but it didn't feel particularly special. The onions, however, were of the giant cippolini variety topped with chantarelle mushrooms. Yum! I would also highly recommend the scallops as they were seared perfectly with a fragile parmesan crisp that will melt in your mouth.Now for the meat! We sampled the signature Poulet Fermier Rôti et Truffé ($30) truffled roasted chicken, country style potatoes, chicken jus and the Côte de Boeuf - Pour Deux ($95) natural fed grilled black angus bone-in ribeye (26 oz), pommes frites, spinach and roquefort salad - for two. You may remember me saying I like to judge a restaurant based on it's chicken before, and according to that rule, Bagatelle passes with flying colors. The truffle sauce was decadent and the chicken was moist and crispy on the outside. The beef was tender and cooked to a nice medium/rare. The French fries that came with it (do you see that giant pile of them!?) were among the best tasting potato wedges I've ever tasted. As for sides, we sampled the mixed mushrooms, grilled asparagus, and roasted Brussels sprouts & butternut squash with candied pecans ($9 each), with the latter definitely a favorite all around the table.Hahaha, you think the feast is over? No way, Jose! (Or should I say no way Jean Pierre?). The chef sent out five different desserts for us all to share. Wowza! In picture order, we tried the Apple Tarte Tatin, Floating Island, Profiteroles with chocolate, drizzle, chocolate mousse, and brioche and pear bread pudding. The floating island was the most interesting dessert; meringue-y and literally floating in a vanilla sauce and topped with almonds, it almost felt healthy (haha, yea right). My favorite was the tarte tatin, a classic done right, although the brioche and pear bread pudding was a close second.Head to Bagatelle the next time you feel like you deserve a culinary treat!",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

In fact because I had a direct view of the hostess stand that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. As we were leaving .... nothing no thank you for coming or anything.

I was dead wrong with both of my assumptions.As soon as I walked in, I realized that I should have had at least two shots of Bourbon at home to prepare for this nonsense. Since these people don't eat, the food was mediocre at best - the choices sparse. I had the thin pancakes but they didn't top them with a tasty syrup. Instead there was a weird tasting thick brown mystery sauce on them. I had a few bites but definitely couldn't subject myself to finishing this mess. They have a variety of drinks available but most of the people looked like they were partying on something extra.They had a DJ spinning music which wasn't too bad once you drank a couple of cups of something. Having a conversation or taking a quick call here is literally impossible. So I decided to kill some time and dance to the bland tracks like that Lil' Jon and Usher song. Every now and then an interesting song would come on that livened things up a bit.Most reviews talk about the ""beautiful"" people, somehow they were missing yesterday afternoon. People watching consisted of a bunch of early 20 somethings and people wishing they were 20 something. Most were trying too hard to get ""noticed"" such as men opening their shirts, licking their fingers and touching their nipples. Of course, the girls who wore too much makeup and their hooker uniforms. Most of the crowd appeared to have tons of work done - picture frozen botox faces, fake dimples, chin and breast implants galore. I prefer to go to places where there is a nice mix of people, this place was sorely missing that. This meant I was surrounded by ""cool"" people and their bad dance moves - money can only buy you so much. The only time I saw a mix of people (besides our 4 person party), they were working in the kitchen and bathroom areas...I felt like we were in the twilight zone circa 1800s.Most of the waiters were in their underwear, not the boxers kind either - ewwww. One was wearing a short hot pink tutu (yes, as in ballet) while a male customer simulated oral sex with a champagne bottle on him. The waiters were forcing drinks down their customers' throats, spitting them at each other and drinking with them. Somehow these idiots believe this raunchy frat house is worth the exorbitant prices.After approximately 30 minutes of this, I sent a ""rescue me"" text to my man. The only place I could take his call was when I sneaked into the kitchen. Until his arrival, I had to endure more of this torture. It took 15 minutes just to get the check, another 10 before I could sign off on the charge and get the heck out of there.If you are in the mood for some bull$h*t, this place is definitely full of it.

434,FQ395CymUlukufGoMQAHSg,Holly K.,1.0 star rating,"HIGHLY unfortunate that customer safety & comfort were compromised for sake of getting a check paid by a customer being served alcohol while clearly under the influence of drugs. I was ready to give this place a positive review based on the excitement and the food, but ultimately had a very disturbing experience after being groped and violated by a drunk & high patron who was allowed to STAY at the bar. I came with a large group for a birthday celebration and our table was near the bar. A group of at the bar purchased a large format bottle of champagne; several of the guests in that party appeared to be highly intoxicated, with one patron even falling off her barstool (and then continued to be served). A man with that group was coming up the stairs from the bathrooms when I was going down the stairs, and he groped me, running his hand across my dress up my thighs and private area. It happened so quickly all I could do was throw his arm and turn to yell at him; he kept going up the stairs. I was shaken and mortified and told my friends what happened when I went back upstairs. Some men from my group confronted him and forced him to apologize, and he was clearly high on drugs, his eyes rolling around, and claimed to not even remember doing it. I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday party by kicking up a huge fuss so I was willing to let it go at that point, HOWEVER, not even 30 minutes later there was a commotion from the stairwell - his partner in crime/drinking buddy forcibly groped ANOTHER woman in the stairwell -- THAT man was asked to leave. We informed the manager/hostess that that was actually the second offense perpetrated by that group of drunk/high individuals. However, the man who groped me was allowed to stay. On our way out, someone in our group overheard the bartender and bouncer discussing their concern over getting the check paid, which made it seem to us that the offender was allowed to stay -- despite assaulting a patron -- because they were worried he wouldn't have paid the check if he was asked to leave. Police could have been called if that came to pass. I have grave concerns over patronizing an establishment that looks the other way when patrons are, essentially, sexually assaulted -- and looks the other way when illegal drugs are clearly being used on their premises -- all so they don't have to worry about chasing someone for a signature on a bar tab. Disgusting. Disappointing. And also setting themselves up for a lawsuit if the next victims happen to be so inclined... not to mention legal liability for continuing to serve individuals who are VISIBLY high and intoxicated, falling off barstools and pouring bottles of champagne on each other's heads.

We asked him about an item on the menu, truffle gnocchi, regarding the size of the dish. We wanted to share so we needed a sharable size. He brings out a dish so small, it wouldn't be enough for even one person. I told him that was way too small. Instead of switching the dish, he brings out the larger size and told us that there was no way we could send the food back.

So love Bagatelle for what it's good at -- putting a smile on your face and some sparklers and champagne on the set :)",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

Definitely a beautiful spot but from what I hear has nothing on the experience of the NYC location. We made dinner reservations for 9pm, already the party was getting started when we walked in. The DJ was spinning, people were dancing right next to other people enjoying a meal. One thing I have to comment on is how f***cking gorgeous the women are that work in this place..like I said I was there with a date and I had to force myself not to stare AND im from LA! we have hot women working at chic-fil-a! anyway, great experience! not for the broke. easily spent more than a 100 on dinner for two so make sure youre good with that! beautiful venue, great service and i beg you to try the pizza noir!  a quick note- I wouldnt  go for a romantic dinner the place is too lively...club music, people talking loud..we had some trouble hearing each other.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

Right from the ""french"" manager to the african american girl at the reception, the butch woman in jeans and the bimbette in the short blue minidress. Considering this place is known for its alcohol, the cocktails were sub standard and far too sweet.The food was average.  As if all this weren't enough, the wait for the change after paying the bill is interminable....because they need to open their ""bank"".

The ambiance is classy but not overly posh. A little pretentious, lots of self-important snobs with deep pockets (even the wait staff and bar tenders had their noses in the air!) but whatever. The food was divine, I ordered eggs Benedict and did everything short of lick my plate lol (ok slight exaggeration)... but very delicious. The menu is on the expensive side, but so is everything else in the Meat Packing District. It turns into a nightclub at 3pm which is fun, they play a mixture of house and hip hop.

Five of us girls got all dolled up and were ready for a fantastic dinner. We has a reservation for 8:00 PM on a Saturday night.. . .we called the restaurant at 7:40 PM letting them know that we would be a little late, (it's NYC on a Saturday night . . . it's hard to get a cab). The receptionist on the phone said ""okay not a problem, come soon"", we arrived at the restaurant at 8:25 PM. Mind you there were LITERALLY 20 open tables, the hostess said she could not seat us because after 15 minutes our reservation is automatically canceled. Why they didn't tell us that on the phone was mind boggling. I am not exaggerating here either, there were 20 open tables. We told the woman she never told us after 15 minutes we would be late and she still refused to seat us. When we asked to speak to a manager she completely ignored us and was raising her voice to myself and my friends. We were calm and just questioning the fact that if we arrived on time we would STILL BE SITTING DOWN EATING. She was nasty and a rude b**ch.  It's sad, we will NEVER go back...",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"
475,lxP7AvAwC7qezffuEwjl1Q,Leza H.,5.0 star rating,"I LOVED IT. We went for the Sunday brunch,arrived at 1. We had a flight to catch and had to leave by 4:30, but I advise arriving at 2-3PM. It starts out as a lovely, classy French restaurant. The windows are all open and there's a lovely breeze. It seems like you are in France. The food and drinks are divine. I ordered Eggs Benedict and it was the best I've ever eaten. And I have that often. We ordered Mimosas to start. Daughter and her friend both had burgers and said they were perfect as well. The service was efficient, a tiny bit uppity.  After we ate lunch we started ordering the drink specials. I don't remembr what they all were, but liked them all. Around 3 the DJ starts. The music is mixed old school. It's soft to begin with. Each song he does the volume increases a unperceptable amount. Then by 4 it's starting to get louder and no one is eating anymore. They start pushing the tables around and then the Jeroboam and Methusalahs start coming out. When we left everyone was having a good time and it had an after hours feel. We hear that later they close big drapes and it is a full club in the afternoon. It was really hard to leave. I am not young or a partier. I had more fun here than anywhere in years. Let me say, this is not to be missed. However, don't bring your parents unless like me they want to go HAM on occasion too. I can't wait till the one in Vegas opens.

478,_Q148_YDDxfFVkOvQv6_vA,Shuchi K.,5.0 star rating,"Bagatelle's revamped avatar continues the vogue tradition of party brunches in all its glory. This isn't the typical pick for your average brunch and one needs to gear up for an afternoon/ evening that is, to put it mildly, highly eventful. The menu seems harmless enough with typical brunch items. Despite food not being the central focus of visiting Bagatelle, it is worth mentioning that the food here is great. The ""Eggs Bagatelle"" are rich, filling and delicious. As the tempo picks up around 3 pm, the restaurant is transformed into a St. Tropez style club with an unmistakably European feel with the crowd dressed for the night. The quantity of bottles that flow per table is entertaining and obscene, yet the norm. Amidst the sparklers, thumping trendy house music, entertaining staff and constantly changing artsy decor, one cannot help but join the party perched atop their dining chairs. While this experience is not for everyone, for others it is addictive and here to stay.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"

My bosses came to my brunch and were highly upset that they had to sit on the end of the table and had like no room. I seen the waiter like three times and he was kind of jerky. I wanted to order cute drinks, and instead of the waiter reading off the specials he just was like order these bottles. I came for cocktails not to pop champagne. The venue is really cute and the DJ was really good. The french toast with Nutella was delicious and I had a great sundae with a sparkler, that was 55 dollars.  The worst part of my experience there was the waiter. He never told us his name, and was very rude. We decided not to tip him well since he sucked. He runs us down outside of the restaurant and was like I deserve more money. The waiter was very rule and was making a scene, so I tipped him money he did not deserve. I would not go there ever again, but I at-least I experienced it.",Bagatelle - NY,3.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Mediterranean,, Beer, Barawsuvqvreabrdbevr"
