0,ueh43L04SWCcA979awaDlg,Clark W.,4.0 star rating,"I was in charge of setting up a sushi reservation for a few couples to kickstart a Friday night out on the town. Needless to say, the pressure was on. Everyone knows that the only thing worse than lackluster Friday is bad sushi. I settled on sushi house and am satisfied that I did. We had a reservation and showed up about 5 minutes early after stopping at Daniel's Wines around the corner to grab a few bottles of the finest Yellow Tail available. We were promptly seated and asked which of two seating locations we preferred. Ice buckets were readily available and a small space heater in the corner was set at just the right temperature to provide some extra warmth on a chilly winter night. Service was good but not great for the duration of the evening, as the waitress was a bit slow to make her way over to the table at times but knowledgeable and quick to remediate any issues that arose. She even knew the exact Pandora playlist that was providing a relaxed, but upbeat vibe for the duration of our stay - ambiance was cool, calm, and collected. The Anniversary roll was very good and the Sahara roll might be one of the better produced during the live-ball era (a baseball reference for all my fans antsy for spring training). The others at the table were all-in-all satisfied with their meals as well, ranking from good (sushi platter for 2) to great (pork gyoza) among other dishes.

One word to sum up this sushi would be ""blah."" The rolls sounded creative but were extremely lacking in taste and texture (they were a bit on the mushy side). Fish tasted fresh, but was almost non-existent. I have seriously never had such a small amount of fish in my rolls in my life. The rolls were also pretty small, in comparison to what we've received at other places, and overall they just didn't seem to be super well-made. It was all just ""okay"" but we don't plan on eating here again...especially for the price.The deal breaker for me was that their wasabi was in packets!! I've never even seen that before but believe me, the taste and consistency was as bad as you think it would be. I love getting a nice clump of wasabi with my sushi and being able to take a chunk off with my chopsticks. Definitely don't want to squeeze runny wasabi out of a package...We tried to order Okinawa but they weren't taking Seamless orders at the time. :(On the plus side?

I mean, the food seemed to be great quality and was presented nicely, but I just wasn't feeling it. I tried 4 different appetizers, one of which was the fried spring rolls. They came with a weird sauce that reminded me of steak sauce. I ordered Chicken Katsu for the entree and was disappointed because it was just a chicken cutlet with a side of that weird sauce for dipping and a side of rice. I googled it and found that there are two ways to serve chicken katsu, the one in a curry sauce form being the one I was expecting. The chicken was tasty but because I was expecting something else I was kind of mad. haha oops. The service was great. Our waitress actually made us move to a different table during apps because she said there was a group coming in who had a reservation. No sweat, we moved over one table so she could take our table and connect it with two others. After our meal, she gave us a free dessert on the house for inconveniencing us! It was a mochi ice cream, which was my favorite thing I ate all night!

6,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"I found out about Sushi House when I came across a deal for it on Groupon, so I thought - why not? I love sushi, and it was close enough to my boyfriend's place so it was worth a try. We came in on a Tuesday at around 7 and there were only a few other people dining there. It was also a rainy night so there might have been fewer people that night. I did see a few people come in for takeout though.First order of business: wine. It's BYOB, which is nice - especially since it doesn't seem like they don't have a drink menu. But that's fine, youll save some $$$ bringing your own drinks anyway. They'll also give you an ice bucket, which was a nice extra.Next, we started with the soft shell crab tempura. This was just okay but it was pretty much what I expected. There was little crab meat, but at least their tempura didn't taste like old oil like most other sushi restaurants.Finally, we ordered the sushi sashimi for two (8 pieces of assorted sushi, 20 pieces of sashimi, a California roll and a spicy tuna roll). This also comes with your choice of miso soup or salad. Everything tasted pretty great, especially the white tuna, which is my fave. Everything was served in a boat, which I was probably a little too excited about (it was my first time having sushi from a sushi boat!)With the Groupon deal, our bill was a reasonable price. Otherwise, it seems a little pricey for standard sushi. I'd probably come back if I had another Groupon deal, or for their Salmondays or Tuna Tuesdays.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'm giving 3 stars just for good service and BYOB, as well as the check-in discount. It's near our home, and we walk by it often enough to see that they had a lot of volume on most nights. I didn't think it'd be a good idea to transition my man into sushi by starting out with the $$$$ sushi joints- why pay such high prices when you can't appreciate the fish yet? Raw fish is an acquired taste (and obsession), so we're making baby steps to get him to where I am in my soosh game. I'm just happy he's willing to try :)The sashimi was meh but fresh enough to eat.

Music was a bit on the louder side, not a distraction, but loud enough to may need to speak a bit louder. Overall the ambience is a nice casual dining experience. The service was acceptable. Nothing to rave about but then again nothing to complain. One thing I felt was rushed with the server continually trying to clean up our table. I still had food on my plate. This can be a good thing sometimes but tonight I felt it was a bit annoying. Just nitpicking really and not a real complaint. I ordered the Combo A with California, salmon, and tuna roll. I honestly think it was very pedestrian and for the price not great. I did also have a yellowtail hand roll for $5 which hit the spot well with a bit of wasabi. Another person got the eel lover's meal and mentioned it was the best eel avocado roll that are had in her life. I did had the opportunity to try out her eel sushi which I did find to be pretty good. The eel was large piece with a good amount of sauce on it. The others at my party had a sashimi platter for two and mentioned the fish was really good. They said 'it's good sushi and sashimi for the money.""In essence, this is a nice casual dining experience but in my opinion I think it's too pricey for the food.

Music was a bit on the louder side, not a distraction, but loud enough to may need to speak a bit louder. Overall the ambience is a nice casual dining experience. The service was acceptable. Nothing to rave about but then again nothing to complain. One thing I felt was rushed with the server continually trying to clean up our table. I still had food on my plate. This can be a good thing sometimes but tonight I felt it was a bit annoying. Just nitpicking really and not a real complaint. I ordered the Combo A with California, salmon, and tuna roll. I honestly think it was very pedestrian and for the price not great. I did also have a yellowtail hand roll for $5 which hit the spot well with a bit of wasabi. Another person got the eel lover's meal and mentioned it was the best eel avocado roll that are had in her life. I did had the opportunity to try out her eel sushi which I did find to be pretty good. The eel was large piece with a good amount of sauce on it. The others at my party had a sashimi platter for two and mentioned the fish was really good. They said 'it's good sushi and sashimi for the money.""In essence, this is a nice casual dining experience but in my opinion I think it's too pricey for the food. Perhaps if I got a more expensive meal it would have been different but I think there are better options out there with a more even spread of quality throughout the price ranges.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Considering it's an Asian-owned restaurant (we met the manager for a Groupon dispute), and a sushi place, we thought the tea was free. Literally every sushi and/or Asian restaurant I have been to gives out hot tea for free. They charged us $2 EACH for such a small amount of tea, which also didn't taste like anything. I had to look inside the tea pot to see if there was a tea bag (surprisingly, there was), but it looked like plain water (was super clear as if there was nothing in it).

Â That was the end of the excitement. Â Atmosphere:The street this place is on reminded me of being in NYC uptown. Â Immediately when walking inside you get hit with a wave of old raw fish. Â The inside is very dark and I couldn't tell if it was clean or dirty. Â The lights were constantly flickering, dimming, etc... Â Prices:This is where GROUPON buyers will flip. Â The menu on the groupon site is false advertising (and a report has been filed about this). Â They show prices super low on groupon, but when you get to the restaurant and look at the menu, they are roughly 75% more expensive than the groupon menu and 20% more expensive than a quality sushi restaurant. Â You will not get your money's worth with the groupon.In addition to the prices, we had 2 other tables near us who brough Living Social vouchers and they were declined. Â Our Groupon was declined as well. Â There was no management on site and this may have been the issue, A BIG ISSUE.Staff:Obnoxious at best. Â Both waitresses had a very poor attitude, they were not attentive, and were talking with an attitude not only to us but other tables as well. Â Food quality:The best part of dinner was the free salad with ginger dressing. Â For appetizers we ordered the gyoza and spring rolls. Â The spring rolls were fried wraps with almost no filling and spring rolls are generally filled with vegetables not what amounted to taquito puree. Â The gyoza was ok and didn't sway my opinion in either direction. Â Our main course consisted of 3 rolls of sushi and a Donburi. Â The spicy tuna was good, but the salmon tasted a bit off. Â The donburi was an interesting dish, but the egg was overcooked and dry. Â We were pretty dissatisfied overall and if I could leave ZERO stars I would. Please be warned if you visit the Sushi House in Hoboken. Â Between the food quality and service this place should be shut down.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Everything else (the experience), only slightly demoted them. Keep in mind people: businesses typically do groupons when they're struggling. Yes, it's very hard to make it out there and so therefore some good businesses must do anything to get customers in. However, in this particular case I have to think the poor quality of food is the reason why Sushi house ALWAYS has groupon and livingsocial deals. My original review as of Thursday, July 31 (3 days ago):Just came from eating at this establishment. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Terrible quality (the lobster was CHEWY)--there's a reason this place is dead. Guaranteed they're out of business within months. Not to mention, it seems the only way they do business is by taking advantage of the groupons. READ THE FINE PRINT THOROUGHLY (my fault that I did not). You would think they would try to be flexible after already seeing I was distraught after what I thought I was ordering (improperly described on grubhub) was not what I received. Instead, they forced me to eat alone in my sweaty gym clothes when all I wanted was to grab a quick bite before getting back to my incredibly long day at work.

From when we ordered to our miso soup arriving at the table about 15 minutes had transpired. The prices have gone up quite a bit since my last visit. $4 for green tea is a little absurd. My wife ordered edamame which never arrived.

As someone who eats at a lot of good and great sushi places in NYC, I was pleasantly surprised by what I ate. The Food:For my first affair I decided to stick with rolls. I chose the Blossom which is highly recommended. Very flavorful and it kept getting better as you chewed it. Our favorite from the 4 we ate. Second was the Tropicana roll. A good roll for those wanting a fishy tasting bite. Not bad. The third was the Grand Canyon roll which was good. A sweet taste bite added by the kiwi topping. Real nice. The 4th roll was actually ordered after the 3 first because I liked what I was eating. For the final one we chose the White Angel. The second best of the 4 we ordered. Very tasty and sweet to the palette. Recommended.For desert we had the Fried Green Tea ice cream. Just get it. Nothing to say other than enjoy! The Restaurant:One of the great features of the Sushi House is that it's BYOB and there's a liquor store right around the block. Perfect! The place is a bit dark and some people may not like that if you eat at night. I don't mind it, especially if you are on a date. But, it was a little tacky having fake candles on the tables. The service was decent, nothing spectacular and it's what I expected from this place. Our waitress did come to our table quite a few times to check up on us and she presented herself with a smile. Luckily, it wasn't too busy so for those complaining in their reviews about how bad the service was, maybe it's because you are going on the weekend when it's really busy or expect superb service in Hoboken. I don't normally eat here, but I've always heard people complain about service at different restaurants. For those complaining, you are just another customer. If you expect to get treated like the president everywhere you eat in Hoboken, why don't you apply for presidency. I love sushi and there's quite a few spots that I stick too on the regular when I'm in NYC. Comparing this place to those on my first visit, I was pleasantly surprise by the quality of the rolls. There's still a lot more I want to eat, including having some sashimi. So, for now I will give this spot a 3 star.

Granted It was just 3 of us .... our server would not honor it because we were 1 person short . We ordered more food than usual and were stuck paying the bill in full and having to go through the hassle of getting a refund from groupon .

The rolls were flimsy and the tofu dish I tried was poorly prepared, swimming in sauce and terribly seasoned IF seasoned at all. We asked for the bill for about 45 minutes. Service was slow. I understand we were sitting in the far corner by the window but we were paying customers and ordered plenty of items for the three of us. We weren't rowdy, just a relaxing girls night out to catch-up however we felt ignored by the waitress all night and it took forever to even get extra napkins. I almost got them myself!I have a lot of patience when it comes to restaurants mostly because I work in the hospitality field but I will never dine here again.

136,clxBV5m1e_16jUhPlheuUQ,David K.,2.0 star rating,"SUSHI HOUSE OF HOBOKEN HAS HOUSE RULES THAT MAY MAKE THE GROUPON DEAL FISHY...Always on the lookout for a deal, my wife let me know that she bought yet another Groupon offer. The deal ended in late February, which means that it was sitting on her phone for about 3 months without us taking advantage of this offer. Buy purchasing the deal $10 (the amount paid) would get you $20 worth of Japanese fare (promotional value is the $10 of purchasing power above the amount paid). As time went on and we continued to procrastinate, we soon realized that our Groupon was going to expire without our ability to take advantage of the offer. We contacted the restaurant to confirm that in the event that the deal would expire that they would still reduce our total bill by the amount paid ($10). After calling Sushi House and confirming that our $10 was good for whenever we would visit we set a target date to dine there for Sunday Lunch to follow the Hoboken Secret Garden Tour.Sunday was a beautiful day with clear skies and perfect walking weather for hobnobbing with Hoboken's highfalutin homeowners as we invaded their homes and gardens to pass judgment on properties that we'll probably never be able to afford. Lunch at Sushi House seemed to be a suitable venue to help us get back to reality and to a spending range within our normal capacity. Before using any Groupon, you should ALWAYS read ""The Fine Print"" associated with the deal:The Fine PrintExpires May 30, 2012Limit 3 per person. Limit 1 per table. Dine-in only. Not valid for lunch special, salmonday, tuna Tuesday, or king crab. Not valid with other offers or promotions.Had we had any promotional value left on our Groupon, then I could understand the why the restaurant could enforce their restriction of using a Groupon for a lunch special. However, the value of our Groupon was equal to our amount paid so it was as if we had purchased a $10 gift certificate. In other words, our $10 which we had paid would get us nothing more than if we had walked in off the street and your friend offered to pay $10 towards your check.There were three of us dining together for lunch. Lourdes M. ordered a 2 roll lunch combo, I ordered a 3 roll lunch combo (Shrimp Tempura, Godzilla, and Manhattan), and Rinath K. ordered a 2 roll combo. At this point the waitress informed us that we could not use our Groupon with the lunch combo. It made absolutely no sense to us at all and I was ready to blow a fuse like at so many other Groupon offering establishments. Fortunately, Rinath K. was the voice of reason and changed her order to a Spider Roll and Miso Soup off the regular menu. As she was no longer ordering a lunch special, her meal would now be eligible for us to use the Groupon. Fortunately, the waitress agreed and took our order inside.The salad was nothing to write home about and was drowning in dressing. The miso soup was flavorful and after a few tastes of from my wife's bowl I wished I had ordered that instead of my soggy salad. The Godzilla roll was nothing like ones that I had seen at other places, but I suppose they reserve the right to call their rolls whatever the hell they want so long as they provide a bland description of the ingredients adjacent to the selected name. This Godzilla roll had shrimp, avocado, and cucumber. Other places roll the whole thing in tempura flakes and fry it until it is hard and bumpy like a lizard's skin ... hence the it's name. Also the size of a Godzilla roll tends to be much bigger and should make anyone cringe when thinking how it could be a mouthful without first being hacked in half with a knife. This was much smaller and manageable as I did not even break a sweat.I spoke to the waitress on the way out and thanked her for her service. I understand that her hands were tied so there was little that she could do. It was greatly appreciated that she did allow us to use our Groupon, because the truth is that we will probably never return. The prices of the regular rolls was ridiculously expensive and with all the restrictions for using the Groupon with specials it makes it all too bothersome an ordeal. While not he worst of the Groupon curse, this one still makes the list.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I also like the vegetable gyoza (dumplings) although it could have had a BIT more steaming, the top edges were a bit hard. My mom had a bento box with shrimp tempura. The shrimp was very fresh but the white rice and the very mild sauce with a simple fried tempura shrimp was really lacking in the flavor department. My mom enjoyed her sushi (california and shrimp tempura 2 huge roles for $10), but my sister said she's had better (but she doesn't eat sushi so this review is for confused sushi eaters that may need this third confusing perspective).

I came here on a date because of the proximity of this place to where I live, and because the other sushi places I knew of in town were too loud. It does look like a cute place with a relaxed vibe from outside so I never thought much of it. Once we walked in I was surprised to see a bunch of TVs in a somewhat dark restaurant. There was a football game going on and they were playing it on the screens. Something about it felt off for me as it contradicted the somewhat intimate feel the restaurant was trying to achieve. I felt like I was at a sports bar eating sushi, which wouldn't be something I personally choose. There was only one waitress and the service got worse as time went by and the place started filling up. The other restaurant patrons seemed like mostly young couples and groups of friends, pretty typical to most places I frequented in Hoboken so far. We ordered the vegetable gyoza which was pretty good and I ordered my usual rolls of sweet potato and either cucumber or avocado roll. The gyoza was pretty good but the rolls were average, definitely not memorable in any way, if anything what I do remember is trying a salmon roll for the first time here and not hating it. This led to me incorporating salmon rolls into what I order at sushi places now which is significant since it's the only fish I eat. Unfortunately, that is the only positive impression I have of this place, and with many better sushi establishments in Hoboken, I probably won't be back.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The deal was $10 for $20. The beauty of GroupOns is that there are very straightforward terms and no ""catches"". The problem started when owner/manager of this establishment did not grasp this concept.I came in looking to use this GroupOn for lunch. I noticed that this place has a decent lunch special of $9.95 for soup and two rolls. I then find out from the waitress and the manager that I would not be able to use my GroupOn on that and had to order off the regular menu.I was clearly irate because the fine print of the GroupOn did not stipulate any such terms. The manager (owner?) pointed to the section of the universal fine print of the GroupOn (that applies to every deal) that said ""cannot be combined with any other offers"". I tried to explain that means that GroupOns just can't be combined with coupons and offers such as 30% off on Mondays or w/e.It's also annoying that the owner tried to rationalize that an item listed on the menu constituted an ""offer"". I've had GroupOns in the past the specifically said it was not valid for lunch but this GroupOn did not list that restriction.Here's the best part. They lost me as a future customer over $3 and change. The two lunch specials (4 rolls total) would have been $9.95 each plus tax for a total of $20. Since they forced me to order 4 rolls off the regular menu the total came to $23 and I didn't get the 2 bowls of soup.I was so annoyed that I didn't really even care how their sushi tasted as I just wanted to get the hell out of there and never come back.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We got a whole bunch of rolls, too many to name, but they were all well made, well balanced, and, again, very fresh- my most important factor in picking a sushi place.The prices are reasonable for the area and the quality of the food, and the BYO option makes it one of the better sushi deals around.

Our server was clearly in the weeds but was handling it as well as she could.I believe everyone's issue with our visit on July 3rd was the management. From the time that we arrived, he spoke to his staff really disresepectfully and having worked in the food industry, I know how much harder it makes it to do your job when your manager isn't behind you.Moving on to our meal, we ordered a noodle dish and 3 rolls. The noodle dish took a while (maybe 40 minutes?) but nothing that wasn't worth waiting for. However, still waiting on our rolls about an hour later and after watching a sushi chef leave..it started to get heated.Apparently what happened is that one of the sushi chefs just left. One of the three tables left in the place with us had ordered more rolls and the server graciously hopped behind the bar and started cranking them out. It was still a pretty long wait so rightfully, they started getting upset and one of them went to question the manager as to why they didn't have enough coverage. I don't know what happened behind closed doors but it sounds like she approached it the right way and he (I believe it) unprofessionally snapped at her. She came out very upset and he came out to confront her and continually act unprofessionally and aggressive telling the table that ""if they don't want to eat their food or pay for it, he'll just call the cops"". After some more exchanging of words, he left the restaurant in a huff appearing to call the cops. The table who was left pretty much hanging and completely insulted, with out any answers, left. However, not before we watched the manager pace 1st street twice on the phone. Almost as soon as they left, he walks back into the restaurant giving his staff hell over who let them leave with out paying and asking why.In my opinion, it looks like he left in order not to deal with anything and then proceeded to give his over worked and under supported staff more wrongly placed hell for his mismanagement and not being on the floor all night. I sincerely was pretty surprised that he hadn't been on the floor all night and was capable of being THAT disrespectful to customers. As much as I hope this helps, I also hope some kind of higher-ups read this also so that he can either be reprimanded and re-trained or let go altogether. Sorry, but it was a pretty horrible display of mismanagement, cowardice and abuse of his staff.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Â We had yet to find a good go to Sushi place that contains equal parts Quality, Quantity, and Value. Â Sad to say we are still looking. Â I really tried to like Sushi House, but unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be. Â It was 6:30 or so on a sunny Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was not even 25% full. Â We decided to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather so I didn't really get a chance to appreciate the inside.I was really trying to give it a far shot but on first impressions alone I knew this was not going to be my go to spot. Â The Menu was covered with a nice metal cover which made it appealing but they were not kept up and were stained and dented and inside the type had been rubbed off and many pages had become wet and warped. Â I know its just window dressing and I would have forgiven it if it wasn't for the food.We started with a Dumpling soup which we thought was really very good. Â Simple, two dumplings and a little tofu was all that was in it and it was good and warm for the cool outdoors. Â Then however things started to go down hill pretty quickly. Â I know how long it takes to prepare sushi and we were waiting outside for awhile before our waitress came back with our dinners. Â There was certainly no rush and we each only ordered 3 rolls. Â At first site the Spicy Tuna Rolls appeared sloppy and on the small side. Â My Volcano rolls was looking a little spartan as well and from appearance I could see that the Avocado was turning brown. Â The Futomaki roll was the only roll that looked really appealing. Â The taste of the rolls did nothing to assuage my growing disappointment though.Each Roll had there own issues but overall the rolls were marred by rather dry rice with no personality to it. Â The Spicy Tuna Rolls were, well there is no other way to say it, they were bad. Â They too were dry and I don't mean just the rice. Â The actual fish mixture seemed dry as if it had been made hours ago and then slathered on when ordered. Â It was indeed spicy but that couldn't mask the fishy taste that was coming from it. Â My boyfriend could not finish his.We were disappointed in Sushi House. Â We had also expressed our disappointment to our waitress who in turn took our concerns to the manager and within moments we were talking with the owner. Â I won't disclose his name but he did apologize and tried to make it right. Â It is this fact alone that will make me one day give them a second chance, but it won't be soon. Â Perhaps we will try his second restaurant. Â I admit today may have been a bad day, but it was a miss of an opportunity.The owner's willingness to talk to us and make it right were the only thing that spared me from giving it one star. Â Perhaps in time I will revisit and change my opinion but for now based on Quality, Quantity and Value; I'm sorry but this was the best I could give.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

After an hour and a half wait, and not a single roll of sushi on our table, our party was reasonably upset. The server was doing her best, but for some reason our order was simply not made by the sushi chefs. After being told (lied to) that they were ""working on it"" we waited an additional thirty minutes. Eventually, our server became so flustered by our obvious annoyance, that she went behind the bar and began to roll our sushi herself. She did a very good job of this, but still, I felt that it was not right that she was put in that position. Our table wanted to know what had gone wrong, why our order was never made, and why we were after two hours, still hungry. I approached the manager to complain of these various mistakes, and was confronted by the most unbelievably rude person I have ever had the misfortune of speaking with. Not only did he provide one excuse after another, he berated me, manipulated my words, and began to insist that I was offended by the waitress (which was simply and completely untrue). He in no way apologized for the terrible service we had received, choosing instead to accuse me of being offended that our waitress was making the food. Â I have never been so rudely spoken to, let alone by someone who was supposed to be providing customer service. After being thoroughly offended by his utter lack of customer service, and complete disregard for our business, we walked out. Now we are facing a charge against us and dealing with the Hoboken police on the matter. I urge anyone who reads this- GO TO A DIFFERENT SUSHI RESTAURANT IN HOBOKEN. Do not waste your time or money on these arrogant, rude, thoughtless people. Illuzion is quite good, as well as Robongi.

The other roll, the madam butterfly was smushed and there was only 5 pieces and smelled like a rotten fish market. The soy beans were shriveled and yellow. So I called them back and asked politely to have someone come back and get the food and to be refunded. The woman I talked to said she couldn't find a manager but if she did she would call me back. 3 hours later she called me back and said she couldn't refund me and the only thing I could do is get new sushi if I drove the food back down there. I told her I did not have a car and was not paying for a taxi, so she hung up on me. When I called back she hung up on me again.

Â The first time I picked up(yes i should have checked) Â and ended up calling them saying they forgot the rice. They had no one available to come so I had to go back there to get it. Also, on the phone she had said she would throw in a roll and of course that didn't happen. Â Now tonight I ordered delivery, they send salad instead of soup, and no rice. They did send someone back eventually, but pretty lame that this happened twice in a row.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The food was good, I have never had anything bad there and this day was no different. My favorite is their spicy tuna, its made very well and one of my favorites and I had for the first time the teryaki chicken and that was exceptionally good as well. My biggest problem with this place was the service, and this is the first time I have felt this way here. The waitress made us feel like she was doing us a favor by waiting on us, never came back to fill our water glasses or ask how we were doing and then when the bill came 'somehow' an extra special roll was added to our bill after I gave her a Living Social coupon. For a place that is still pretty pricey I felt we should have gotten way better service. I will probably go back but not at an off time, their usual dinner staff has always been pleasant.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I ordered in a sushi combo (tuna, salmon, california) tonight, but i was disappointed to find mostly rice and very little fish in them. The seaweed was chewy and didn't taste fresh. I'm never getting sushi from here again, given there are some other very nice japanese restaurants in town.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
