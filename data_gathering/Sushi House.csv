0,ueh43L04SWCcA979awaDlg,Clark W.,4.0 star rating,"I was in charge of setting up a sushi reservation for a few couples to kickstart a Friday night out on the town. Needless to say, the pressure was on. Everyone knows that the only thing worse than lackluster Friday is bad sushi. I settled on sushi house and am satisfied that I did. We had a reservation and showed up about 5 minutes early after stopping at Daniel's Wines around the corner to grab a few bottles of the finest Yellow Tail available. We were promptly seated and asked which of two seating locations we preferred. Ice buckets were readily available and a small space heater in the corner was set at just the right temperature to provide some extra warmth on a chilly winter night. Service was good but not great for the duration of the evening, as the waitress was a bit slow to make her way over to the table at times but knowledgeable and quick to remediate any issues that arose. She even knew the exact Pandora playlist that was providing a relaxed, but upbeat vibe for the duration of our stay - ambiance was cool, calm, and collected. The Anniversary roll was very good and the Sahara roll might be one of the better produced during the live-ball era (a baseball reference for all my fans antsy for spring training). The others at the table were all-in-all satisfied with their meals as well, ranking from good (sushi platter for 2) to great (pork gyoza) among other dishes. I'll gladly revisit.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

One word to sum up this sushi would be ""blah."" The rolls sounded creative but were extremely lacking in taste and texture (they were a bit on the mushy side). Fish tasted fresh, but was almost non-existent. I have seriously never had such a small amount of fish in my rolls in my life. The rolls were also pretty small, in comparison to what we've received at other places, and overall they just didn't seem to be super well-made. It was all just ""okay"" but we don't plan on eating here again...especially for the price.The deal breaker for me was that their wasabi was in packets!! I've never even seen that before but believe me, the taste and consistency was as bad as you think it would be. I love getting a nice clump of wasabi with my sushi and being able to take a chunk off with my chopsticks. Definitely don't want to squeeze runny wasabi out of a package...We tried to order Okinawa but they weren't taking Seamless orders at the time. :(On the plus side?

I mean, the food seemed to be great quality and was presented nicely, but I just wasn't feeling it. I tried 4 different appetizers, one of which was the fried spring rolls. They came with a weird sauce that reminded me of steak sauce. I ordered Chicken Katsu for the entree and was disappointed because it was just a chicken cutlet with a side of that weird sauce for dipping and a side of rice. I googled it and found that there are two ways to serve chicken katsu, the one in a curry sauce form being the one I was expecting. The chicken was tasty but because I was expecting something else I was kind of mad. haha oops. The service was great. Our waitress actually made us move to a different table during apps because she said there was a group coming in who had a reservation. No sweat, we moved over one table so she could take our table and connect it with two others. After our meal, she gave us a free dessert on the house for inconveniencing us! It was a mochi ice cream, which was my favorite thing I ate all night!

6,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"I found out about Sushi House when I came across a deal for it on Groupon, so I thought - why not? I love sushi, and it was close enough to my boyfriend's place so it was worth a try. We came in on a Tuesday at around 7 and there were only a few other people dining there. It was also a rainy night so there might have been fewer people that night. I did see a few people come in for takeout though.First order of business: wine. It's BYOB, which is nice - especially since it doesn't seem like they don't have a drink menu. But that's fine, youll save some $$$ bringing your own drinks anyway. They'll also give you an ice bucket, which was a nice extra.Next, we started with the soft shell crab tempura. This was just okay but it was pretty much what I expected. There was little crab meat, but at least their tempura didn't taste like old oil like most other sushi restaurants.Finally, we ordered the sushi sashimi for two (8 pieces of assorted sushi, 20 pieces of sashimi, a California roll and a spicy tuna roll). This also comes with your choice of miso soup or salad. Everything tasted pretty great, especially the white tuna, which is my fave. Everything was served in a boat, which I was probably a little too excited about (it was my first time having sushi from a sushi boat!)With the Groupon deal, our bill was a reasonable price. Otherwise, it seems a little pricey for standard sushi. I'd probably come back if I had another Groupon deal, or for their Salmondays or Tuna Tuesdays.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'm giving 3 stars just for good service and BYOB, as well as the check-in discount. It's near our home, and we walk by it often enough to see that they had a lot of volume on most nights. I didn't think it'd be a good idea to transition my man into sushi by starting out with the $$$$ sushi joints- why pay such high prices when you can't appreciate the fish yet? Raw fish is an acquired taste (and obsession), so we're making baby steps to get him to where I am in my soosh game. I'm just happy he's willing to try :)The sashimi was meh but fresh enough to eat.

Music was a bit on the louder side, not a distraction, but loud enough to may need to speak a bit louder. Overall the ambience is a nice casual dining experience. The service was acceptable. Nothing to rave about but then again nothing to complain. One thing I felt was rushed with the server continually trying to clean up our table. I still had food on my plate. This can be a good thing sometimes but tonight I felt it was a bit annoying. Just nitpicking really and not a real complaint. I ordered the Combo A with California, salmon, and tuna roll. I honestly think it was very pedestrian and for the price not great. I did also have a yellowtail hand roll for $5 which hit the spot well with a bit of wasabi. Another person got the eel lover's meal and mentioned it was the best eel avocado roll that are had in her life. I did had the opportunity to try out her eel sushi which I did find to be pretty good. The eel was large piece with a good amount of sauce on it. The others at my party had a sashimi platter for two and mentioned the fish was really good. They said 'it's good sushi and sashimi for the money.""In essence, this is a nice casual dining experience but in my opinion I think it's too pricey for the food.

Music was a bit on the louder side, not a distraction, but loud enough to may need to speak a bit louder. Overall the ambience is a nice casual dining experience. The service was acceptable. Nothing to rave about but then again nothing to complain. One thing I felt was rushed with the server continually trying to clean up our table. I still had food on my plate. This can be a good thing sometimes but tonight I felt it was a bit annoying. Just nitpicking really and not a real complaint. I ordered the Combo A with California, salmon, and tuna roll. I honestly think it was very pedestrian and for the price not great. I did also have a yellowtail hand roll for $5 which hit the spot well with a bit of wasabi. Another person got the eel lover's meal and mentioned it was the best eel avocado roll that are had in her life. I did had the opportunity to try out her eel sushi which I did find to be pretty good. The eel was large piece with a good amount of sauce on it. The others at my party had a sashimi platter for two and mentioned the fish was really good. They said 'it's good sushi and sashimi for the money.""In essence, this is a nice casual dining experience but in my opinion I think it's too pricey for the food. Perhaps if I got a more expensive meal it would have been different but I think there are better options out there with a more even spread of quality throughout the price ranges.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Also, the avocado in the rolls took up all the room so there was barely any room for the tuna & salmon. What makes me angry the most is the server offered us hot tea. Considering it's an Asian-owned restaurant (we met the manager for a Groupon dispute), and a sushi place, we thought the tea was free. Literally every sushi and/or Asian restaurant I have been to gives out hot tea for free. They charged us $2 EACH for such a small amount of tea, which also didn't taste like anything. I had to look inside the tea pot to see if there was a tea bag (surprisingly, there was), but it looked like plain water (was super clear as if there was nothing in it).

Everything else (the experience), only slightly demoted them. Keep in mind people: businesses typically do groupons when they're struggling. Yes, it's very hard to make it out there and so therefore some good businesses must do anything to get customers in. However, in this particular case I have to think the poor quality of food is the reason why Sushi house ALWAYS has groupon and livingsocial deals. My original review as of Thursday, July 31 (3 days ago):Just came from eating at this establishment. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Terrible quality (the lobster was CHEWY)--there's a reason this place is dead. Guaranteed they're out of business within months. Not to mention, it seems the only way they do business is by taking advantage of the groupons. READ THE FINE PRINT THOROUGHLY (my fault that I did not). You would think they would try to be flexible after already seeing I was distraught after what I thought I was ordering (improperly described on grubhub) was not what I received. Instead, they forced me to eat alone in my sweaty gym clothes when all I wanted was to grab a quick bite before getting back to my incredibly long day at work. Had I read the yelp reviews I wouldn't have bought the groupon but I mistakenly thought I was headed to Sushi Lounge.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I used to go to their uptown location very often before it closed down recently. My most recent visit to Sushi House downtown left much to be desired. Service was extremely slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived. It later got crowded, but that was because our dinner took so long that we were there for quite a while. From when we ordered to our miso soup arriving at the table about 15 minutes had transpired. The prices have gone up quite a bit since my last visit. $4 for green tea is a little absurd. My wife ordered edamame which never arrived.

As someone who eats at a lot of good and great sushi places in NYC, I was pleasantly surprised by what I ate. The Food:For my first affair I decided to stick with rolls. I chose the Blossom which is highly recommended. Very flavorful and it kept getting better as you chewed it. Our favorite from the 4 we ate. Second was the Tropicana roll. A good roll for those wanting a fishy tasting bite. Not bad. The third was the Grand Canyon roll which was good. A sweet taste bite added by the kiwi topping. Real nice. The 4th roll was actually ordered after the 3 first because I liked what I was eating. For the final one we chose the White Angel. The second best of the 4 we ordered. Very tasty and sweet to the palette. Recommended.For desert we had the Fried Green Tea ice cream. Just get it. Nothing to say other than enjoy! The Restaurant:One of the great features of the Sushi House is that it's BYOB and there's a liquor store right around the block. Perfect! The place is a bit dark and some people may not like that if you eat at night. I don't mind it, especially if you are on a date. But, it was a little tacky having fake candles on the tables. The service was decent, nothing spectacular and it's what I expected from this place. Our waitress did come to our table quite a few times to check up on us and she presented herself with a smile. Luckily, it wasn't too busy so for those complaining in their reviews about how bad the service was, maybe it's because you are going on the weekend when it's really busy or expect superb service in Hoboken. I don't normally eat here, but I've always heard people complain about service at different restaurants. For those complaining, you are just another customer. If you expect to get treated like the president everywhere you eat in Hoboken, why don't you apply for presidency. I love sushi and there's quite a few spots that I stick too on the regular when I'm in NYC. Comparing this place to those on my first visit, I was pleasantly surprise by the quality of the rolls. There's still a lot more I want to eat, including having some sashimi. So, for now I will give this spot a 3 star.

They were pretty small for the price of a ""specialty roll "" and the price was a notch or two above premade supermarket sushi . (Ouch). The only roll I do like is the ""Bikini "" , which is a fried roll with eel and cream cheese . Other than that ..  Nothing else stood out . Also , The fried calamari is a joke ... Small , bland and forgettable . Finally , on my last visit I used a Groupon . Which stated it was for 4 people . Granted It was just 3 of us .... our server would not honor it because we were 1 person short . We ordered more food than usual and were stuck paying the bill in full and having to go through the hassle of getting a refund from groupon . The worst part was that she stated she was the manager but was extremely rude about it and basically fought with me about it in front of other patrons for at least 10 min , talking extremely loud in her broken English .  EMBARRASSING!

No drink orders were taken(granted we had wine but what if we wanted a soda or something different) We ordered separate items. Our food came on one plate instead of two like it should of. My guess was that our waitress put the order in as one order instead of two.

My other  friend ordered dumplings and it came out before the rest of our food instead of it coming out together. (Like we asked) Then 45 mins later our food came out and so did another order of dumplings,(I'm assuming they either messed up or it was on the house because we weren't charged for it ) Then of-course when it came down the check, she was attentive then. Pacing back and forth to see if I was ready. Granted it may have been a little busy .But she had no manners. We asked for forks and she gave them to one person and told her to pass them around.

After looking at the menu, we learned that it was BYOB so we ran to a nearby liquor store while waiting for our food. We ordered 4 rolls- 3 regulars (spicy salmon, eel and avocado and one with mango, salmon and tuna) and 1 chef's specialty roll. When the rolls came out, we were underwhelmed.. The rolls were small for the prices (ex. 6 pieces instead of 8 at most sushi restaurants). The sushi was nothing special and in my opinion, not worth it for the price. We came here with a $20 Living Social deal but will likely not be coming back in the future.

The rolls were flimsy and the tofu dish I tried was poorly prepared, swimming in sauce and terribly seasoned IF seasoned at all. We asked for the bill for about 45 minutes. Service was slow. I understand we were sitting in the far corner by the window but we were paying customers and ordered plenty of items for the three of us. We weren't rowdy, just a relaxing girls night out to catch-up however we felt ignored by the waitress all night and it took forever to even get extra napkins.

136,clxBV5m1e_16jUhPlheuUQ,David K.,2.0 star rating,"SUSHI HOUSE OF HOBOKEN HAS HOUSE RULES THAT MAY MAKE THE GROUPON DEAL FISHY...Always on the lookout for a deal, my wife let me know that she bought yet another Groupon offer. The deal ended in late February, which means that it was sitting on her phone for about 3 months without us taking advantage of this offer. Buy purchasing the deal $10 (the amount paid) would get you $20 worth of Japanese fare (promotional value is the $10 of purchasing power above the amount paid). As time went on and we continued to procrastinate, we soon realized that our Groupon was going to expire without our ability to take advantage of the offer. We contacted the restaurant to confirm that in the event that the deal would expire that they would still reduce our total bill by the amount paid ($10). After calling Sushi House and confirming that our $10 was good for whenever we would visit we set a target date to dine there for Sunday Lunch to follow the Hoboken Secret Garden Tour.Sunday was a beautiful day with clear skies and perfect walking weather for hobnobbing with Hoboken's highfalutin homeowners as we invaded their homes and gardens to pass judgment on properties that we'll probably never be able to afford. Lunch at Sushi House seemed to be a suitable venue to help us get back to reality and to a spending range within our normal capacity. Before using any Groupon, you should ALWAYS read ""The Fine Print"" associated with the deal:The Fine PrintExpires May 30, 2012Limit 3 per person. Limit 1 per table. Dine-in only. Not valid for lunch special, salmonday, tuna Tuesday, or king crab. Not valid with other offers or promotions.Had we had any promotional value left on our Groupon, then I could understand the why the restaurant could enforce their restriction of using a Groupon for a lunch special. However, the value of our Groupon was equal to our amount paid so it was as if we had purchased a $10 gift certificate. In other words, our $10 which we had paid would get us nothing more than if we had walked in off the street and your friend offered to pay $10 towards your check.There were three of us dining together for lunch. Lourdes M. ordered a 2 roll lunch combo, I ordered a 3 roll lunch combo (Shrimp Tempura, Godzilla, and Manhattan), and Rinath K. ordered a 2 roll combo. At this point the waitress informed us that we could not use our Groupon with the lunch combo. It made absolutely no sense to us at all and I was ready to blow a fuse like at so many other Groupon offering establishments. Fortunately, Rinath K. was the voice of reason and changed her order to a Spider Roll and Miso Soup off the regular menu. As she was no longer ordering a lunch special, her meal would now be eligible for us to use the Groupon. Fortunately, the waitress agreed and took our order inside.The salad was nothing to write home about and was drowning in dressing. The miso soup was flavorful and after a few tastes of from my wife's bowl I wished I had ordered that instead of my soggy salad. The Godzilla roll was nothing like ones that I had seen at other places, but I suppose they reserve the right to call their rolls whatever the hell they want so long as they provide a bland description of the ingredients adjacent to the selected name. This Godzilla roll had shrimp, avocado, and cucumber. Other places roll the whole thing in tempura flakes and fry it until it is hard and bumpy like a lizard's skin ... hence the it's name. Also the size of a Godzilla roll tends to be much bigger and should make anyone cringe when thinking how it could be a mouthful without first being hacked in half with a knife. This was much smaller and manageable as I did not even break a sweat.I spoke to the waitress on the way out and thanked her for her service. I understand that her hands were tied so there was little that she could do. It was greatly appreciated that she did allow us to use our Groupon, because the truth is that we will probably never return. The prices of the regular rolls was ridiculously expensive and with all the restrictions for using the Groupon with specials it makes it all too bothersome an ordeal. While not he worst of the Groupon curse, this one still makes the list.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I also like the vegetable gyoza (dumplings) although it could have had a BIT more steaming, the top edges were a bit hard. My mom had a bento box with shrimp tempura. The shrimp was very fresh but the white rice and the very mild sauce with a simple fried tempura shrimp was really lacking in the flavor department. My mom enjoyed her sushi (california and shrimp tempura 2 huge roles for $10), but my sister said she's had better (but she doesn't eat sushi so this review is for confused sushi eaters that may need this third confusing perspective).

I came here on a date because of the proximity of this place to where I live, and because the other sushi places I knew of in town were too loud. It does look like a cute place with a relaxed vibe from outside so I never thought much of it. Once we walked in I was surprised to see a bunch of TVs in a somewhat dark restaurant. There was a football game going on and they were playing it on the screens. Something about it felt off for me as it contradicted the somewhat intimate feel the restaurant was trying to achieve. I felt like I was at a sports bar eating sushi, which wouldn't be something I personally choose. There was only one waitress and the service got worse as time went by and the place started filling up. The other restaurant patrons seemed like mostly young couples and groups of friends, pretty typical to most places I frequented in Hoboken so far. We ordered the vegetable gyoza which was pretty good and I ordered my usual rolls of sweet potato and either cucumber or avocado roll. The gyoza was pretty good but the rolls were average, definitely not memorable in any way, if anything what I do remember is trying a salmon roll for the first time here and not hating it. This led to me incorporating salmon rolls into what I order at sushi places now which is significant since it's the only fish I eat. Unfortunately, that is the only positive impression I have of this place, and with many better sushi establishments in Hoboken, I probably won't be back.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The deal was $10 for $20. The beauty of GroupOns is that there are very straightforward terms and no ""catches"". The problem started when owner/manager of this establishment did not grasp this concept.I came in looking to use this GroupOn for lunch. I noticed that this place has a decent lunch special of $9.95 for soup and two rolls. I then find out from the waitress and the manager that I would not be able to use my GroupOn on that and had to order off the regular menu.I was clearly irate because the fine print of the GroupOn did not stipulate any such terms. The manager (owner?) pointed to the section of the universal fine print of the GroupOn (that applies to every deal) that said ""cannot be combined with any other offers"". I tried to explain that means that GroupOns just can't be combined with coupons and offers such as 30% off on Mondays or w/e.It's also annoying that the owner tried to rationalize that an item listed on the menu constituted an ""offer"". I've had GroupOns in the past the specifically said it was not valid for lunch but this GroupOn did not list that restriction.Here's the best part. They lost me as a future customer over $3 and change. The two lunch specials (4 rolls total) would have been $9.95 each plus tax for a total of $20. Since they forced me to order 4 rolls off the regular menu the total came to $23 and I didn't get the 2 bowls of soup.I was so annoyed that I didn't really even care how their sushi tasted as I just wanted to get the hell out of there and never come back.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We got a whole bunch of rolls, too many to name, but they were all well made, well balanced, and, again, very fresh- my most important factor in picking a sushi place.The prices are reasonable for the area and the quality of the food, and the BYO option makes it one of the better sushi deals around.

177,ncEoecLIruhN1iHzQRCqjA,Nik U.,1.0 star rating,"Let's get the food and the service out of the way. We've ordered from here before and the food is always really great. Our server was clearly in the weeds but was handling it as well as she could.I believe everyone's issue with our visit on July 3rd was the management. From the time that we arrived, he spoke to his staff really disresepectfully and having worked in the food industry, I know how much harder it makes it to do your job when your manager isn't behind you.Moving on to our meal, we ordered a noodle dish and 3 rolls. The noodle dish took a while (maybe 40 minutes?) but nothing that wasn't worth waiting for. However, still waiting on our rolls about an hour later and after watching a sushi chef leave..it started to get heated.Apparently what happened is that one of the sushi chefs just left. One of the three tables left in the place with us had ordered more rolls and the server graciously hopped behind the bar and started cranking them out. It was still a pretty long wait so rightfully, they started getting upset and one of them went to question the manager as to why they didn't have enough coverage. I don't know what happened behind closed doors but it sounds like she approached it the right way and he (I believe it) unprofessionally snapped at her. She came out very upset and he came out to confront her and continually act unprofessionally and aggressive telling the table that ""if they don't want to eat their food or pay for it, he'll just call the cops"". After some more exchanging of words, he left the restaurant in a huff appearing to call the cops. The table who was left pretty much hanging and completely insulted, with out any answers, left. However, not before we watched the manager pace 1st street twice on the phone. Almost as soon as they left, he walks back into the restaurant giving his staff hell over who let them leave with out paying and asking why.In my opinion, it looks like he left in order not to deal with anything and then proceeded to give his over worked and under supported staff more wrongly placed hell for his mismanagement and not being on the floor all night. I sincerely was pretty surprised that he hadn't been on the floor all night and was capable of being THAT disrespectful to customers. As much as I hope this helps, I also hope some kind of higher-ups read this also so that he can either be reprimanded and re-trained or let go altogether. Sorry, but it was a pretty horrible display of mismanagement, cowardice and abuse of his staff.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

After an hour and a half wait, and not a single roll of sushi on our table, our party was reasonably upset. The server was doing her best, but for some reason our order was simply not made by the sushi chefs. After being told (lied to) that they were ""working on it"" we waited an additional thirty minutes. Eventually, our server became so flustered by our obvious annoyance, that she went behind the bar and began to roll our sushi herself. She did a very good job of this, but still, I felt that it was not right that she was put in that position. Our table wanted to know what had gone wrong, why our order was never made, and why we were after two hours, still hungry. I approached the manager to complain of these various mistakes, and was confronted by the most unbelievably rude person I have ever had the misfortune of speaking with. Not only did he provide one excuse after another, he berated me, manipulated my words, and began to insist that I was offended by the waitress (which was simply and completely untrue). He in no way apologized for the terrible service we had received, choosing instead to accuse me of being offended that our waitress was making the food.  I have never been so rudely spoken to, let alone by someone who was supposed to be providing customer service. After being thoroughly offended by his utter lack of customer service, and complete disregard for our business, we walked out. Now we are facing a charge against us and dealing with the Hoboken police on the matter. I urge anyone who reads this- GO TO A DIFFERENT SUSHI RESTAURANT IN HOBOKEN. Do not waste your time or money on these arrogant, rude, thoughtless people. Illuzion is quite good, as well as Robongi.

Absolutely.  The past couple times I've been there I usually order 1 Philadelphia Roll (substitute cucumber for avocado) PLEASE NOTE, they are unreasonably difficult about substitutions.  They give you a hard time and then if you press them they'll do it, sometimes for a dollar extra, but its worth it: AVOCADO OBVIOUSLY TRUMPS CUCUMBER.Also have been ordering a Tokyo roll which is spicy salmon with tempera flakes and avocado.  And then maybe salmon and avocado roll.  They're all pretty decent but I'm not a huge fan of the quantity of rice that they use on the roll.   It's quite a thick layer.  Disappointing items on the menu for me were the garden salad and the miso soup.  Soup was saltier than most and the dressing for the salad was not up to bat.  Which is the whole reason why you'd ever order this iceberg mess.  The staff is very nice here and I will definitively continue to order from this place.  I have only taken out so far.  One time when they did not give me the right roll, they let me keep it and sent the right one out immediately, which was awesome.  If you're not expecting a miracle in your mouth, I think you will find this place pleasing.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Then called me a liar when I called them back, and said they had no more drivers at 3pm on a Tuesday so they couldn't bring me another one. Then I finally looked at my other food, all of the fish was rubbery and smelled very old. The white fish was yellow and brown. The other roll, the madam butterfly was smushed and there was only 5 pieces and smelled like a rotten fish market. The soy beans were shriveled and yellow. So I called them back and asked politely to have someone come back and get the food and to be refunded. The woman I talked to said she couldn't find a manager but if she did she would call me back. 3 hours later she called me back and said she couldn't refund me and the only thing I could do is get new sushi if I drove the food back down there. I told her I did not have a car and was not paying for a taxi, so she hung up on me. When I called back she hung up on me again. Then my roommate called her back from a different number and the woman told her to take it up with delivery.com and that we were crazy liars because there was nothing wrong with our food.

The food is expensive and average.  That wasn't my problem though. Both times I ordered a simple meal.  Spicy tuna roll and pork.  This should come with rice and soup or salad.  The first time I picked up(yes i should have checked)  and ended up calling them saying they forgot the rice. They had no one available to come so I had to go back there to get it. Also, on the phone she had said she would throw in a roll and of course that didn't happen.  Now tonight I ordered delivery, they send salad instead of soup, and no rice. They did send someone back eventually, but pretty lame that this happened twice in a row.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The food was good, I have never had anything bad there and this day was no different. My favorite is their spicy tuna, its made very well and one of my favorites and I had for the first time the teryaki chicken and that was exceptionally good as well. My biggest problem with this place was the service, and this is the first time I have felt this way here. The waitress made us feel like she was doing us a favor by waiting on us, never came back to fill our water glasses or ask how we were doing and then when the bill came 'somehow' an extra special roll was added to our bill after I gave her a Living Social coupon. For a place that is still pretty pricey I felt we should have gotten way better service. I will probably go back but not at an off time, their usual dinner staff has always been pleasant.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I ordered in a sushi combo (tuna, salmon, california) tonight, but i was disappointed to find mostly rice and very little fish in them. The seaweed was chewy and didn't taste fresh. I'm never getting sushi from here again, given there are some other very nice japanese restaurants in town.",Sushi House,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
