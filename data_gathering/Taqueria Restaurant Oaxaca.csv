1,QxTNaHoxTL8f7jAK5nwQ1g,Nicholas G.,2.0 star rating,It was very very average. I had no problem with the service or delivery process. The torta was bland and not good. The worst part was the bread which was stale. It was overall very dry and this sandwich is not in the same ball park as the mexican spots in sunset park.The tacos were ok but the tortilla's were not great. They were homemade but they tasted grainy. Guacamole was ok. The enchilada's were also not as great as advertised. Hopefully it was a bad batch but damn was it average. Just was not great and i had heard a lot about this place. Maybe i will come back to try again but i am not sure.,Taqueria Restaurant Oaxaca,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
2,-ZjTqfH_FCa27cUCgycj0w,Hersh S.,1.0 star rating,"Initially ordered chips and guacamole, but they said didn't have any. Got chips and salsa instead. Expected to get homemade chips and home made salsa. Instead I got the home made chips which had a bit too much grease on them. And store bought salsa. I'm also able to tell by the familiar taste that it's most likely old El Paso brand salsa. Paid $6 for the portion. Probably could have just gone to Costco can gotten a gallon of salsa and a giant bag of chips for just a few bucks more. Totally feel ripped off. I didn't order other food from there as there were many pre cooked items in the casing up font that didn't look all that fresh.",Taqueria Restaurant Oaxaca,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

5,Xo6QEQhhhIIHIreWmN2ukA,Patty G.,4.0 star rating,"What in the world just happened!! This place just did me dirty! How are you going to make me choose between you and my favorite Mexican spot on Central. Talk about #FirstWorldProblemsOkay, this hole in the wall is a gem all the way. Restaurant/Bodega with a tiny kitchen is definitely delivering BIG flavors! I came by for the first time tonight, how have I never been here before, is my question to myself. Anyway, I ordered the Cajun Chicken salad but the girl kept saying it comes with rice and beans. Un momento por favor, it's under Salad options.. that totally confused me but nonetheless they made it happen.Two words: GINORMOUSLY DELICIOUS! I'm always a fan of left overs so this is definitely dinner and lunch for tomorrow. The salad is simple: lettuce, tomatoes, onions, Mexican cheese, and some carrots. The chicken, man, the chicken makes that salad amazing! As if that wasn't enough I order some guaca, now, it didn't come with chips which is fine because I actually wanted to eat it with baby carrots, but what gives? Must I ask for the chips too? I will definitely have to see about that next time I hit this spot. Overall, awesome place and perhaps my new Mexican place to hit up when the craving hits.",Taqueria Restaurant Oaxaca,3.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
6,cQxiAHKd7RD4U90d7VPsSA,Stephanie Y.,4.0 star rating,"If you're looking for the spiciest Mexican food in #JerseyCity, look no further. Their green sauce (found in the enchiladas, chilaquiles and more) is friggin' a spice factory and I like my grub spicy. It's literally a hole in the wall. A few tables in a Mexican bodega; pretty sure it doesn't get much more authentic than that. Be patient, staff knows limited English, but I got to pratiquar my espanol, so all good.The guac was full of cilantro, which I loved and for the $4.50 was a ginormous amount. The enchiladas were so spicy and a large portion; I could barely finish (read barely). It was good, not great. The chicken was a little dry (but plentiful) and again the spice! My guy's chilaquiles with carne asada came with a heaping portion of thinly pounded meat atop a mound of smothered green sauce chips. It could have used more cheese/crema and the chips were a bit stale. That didn't stop him from eating it right up. Good, but not the best.Price tag was cheap as hell. I'm a fan. I still heart taqueria. I still heart Los Tres Chillitos, and you know what? I heart this place too. All a little different, all a great local business. Overall, I think I'd give it a high 3.5, but in Yelp life that means a 4!A few other things:Free chips and salsa - don't fill up. The salsa they serve is weak sauce.This is also a bodega - so if you need some Mexican dry goods or products, you can find it here!

8,4DTgHCQ89P4ATeOPejRCVg,Randall C.,1.0 star rating,"I HATE TO BE LIED TO AND RIPPED OFF!! I had plans to make a huge batch of nachos for a pot luck Thanksgiving I was attending on (of course) Thanksgiving. I walked in and asked if they made their tortilla chips from scratch - in other words, from actual corn tortillas that had been cut into wedge-shaped portions and deep-fried. They said, ""Yes, we do."" They had large brown paper bags and I said I'd take two bags filled w/ these. They said it would be about 20 minutes (seemed too short a time to me), but I said okay and took care of some other shopping. When I returned, the owner - who suddenly spoke no English - was taking restaurant supply-grade tortilla chips out from the oven (to, I guess, make the chips appear/feel to be fresh-made) and putting them in the bag. I told her, ""Those aren't the real tortilla chips we agreed you'd make for me."" but she insisted they were. The other cook in the kitchen pipped in to say she made them herself. I looked around for a deep fryer, didn't see one and asked the other cook, ""Where did you fry them?"" She pointed to a frying pan on the burner and said, ""There."" I've worked in kitchens and know my way around food. For her to have fried the amount of tortilla chips they were bagging up for me would have taken HOURS to fry in a frying pan on a stove top. Plus, the chips were thin (not actually fried tortillas) and she was scooping them into my bag off of baking sheets she'd taken from the oven.  I bought one bag (time was getting tight for me, so I couldn't keep walking into Mexican restaurants to see if they'd do this for me) and a couple of containers of Pico de Gallo (which WAS homemade and actually really good).. but to be bullshitted and charged for food that was supposed to be homemade but was blatantly factory-made from a bag and then heated up to fool the 'stupid gringo' was just plain thievery. To make matters worse, their menu looked interesting and as a transplanted Californian always looking for decent Mexican cooking, I will never know how good their food is because I WILL NEVER GIVE THIEVES AND LIARS a penny knowingly.
