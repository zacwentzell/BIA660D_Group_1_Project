1,tygRUEg5SnUJXpq7IsV4mw,Kathy X.,4.0 star rating,"A friend and I came here for a late brunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We were seated immediately by one of the large windows which was really nice. I enjoyed the cozy and warm atmosphere. It was a lovely respite from the rain. Along with brunch, there was complimentary bread and homemade marmalade. There were 2 types: Raisin and nut wheat bread and mini muffins. Both were wonderful tasting. The raisin and nut bread was hearty and was great with the butter and raspberry jam, while the muffin was perfectly moist. I had a tough time deciding what to order (what else is new?), as there were quite a few appetizing sounding options. I finally decided on the Laffa Taco, which came with spicy garlic fries. The taco filling included scrambled eggs with chorizo, manchego cheese and salsa verde. It was really pretty presentation, filled with bright colors of yellow, orange, red and green. In addition to the 2 tacos and fries, there was a small salad on the side with red and yellow tomatoes. I really liked that there was plenty of filling for the tacos. The flavors from this meal were amazing! The eggs mixed with the chorizo was delightfully seasoned, the peppers were juicy and fresh and the cheese complemented the rest of the ingredients well. The pita bread used for the shell of the taco was also so good... Fluffy, soft, still warm. And the french fries were delicious, as well as very crispy with lots of garlic. My friend tried the Housemade Chicken Sausage, which included butternut squash, green apple hash, Parmesan and 2 eggs over easy. There was also a slice of orange and strawberry. Again, the presentation was really aesthetically pleasing. I tried some of the chicken sausage and butternut squash + green apple hash and I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage but liked the butternut squash. The service was okay, though at first it was a bit on the slow side and I noticed that the party next to us, who came after us got the complimentary bread first so I had to ask the waitress if we would be also be getting that. However, it definitely got better and I enjoyed my experience. I would come back for dinner.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

It was the perfect balance of flavorful and cheesy. As far as the drinks, we ordered a drink called the Alfie and funny enough, out waiter was Alfie himself!

The restaurant is small but the ambience is cozy and inviting. We started with the fried artichoke and the Mediterranean combination platter--both out of this world. The dips are delicious and the beets and cumin coated carrots are so fresh and tasty! I could go on and on. They serve this all with warm pita and they also come around with other bread if you're interested. Next we got the mousakka and it was so good that we ordered a second one. It was the perfect balance of flavorful and cheesy. As far as the drinks, we ordered a drink called the Alfie and funny enough, out waiter was Alfie himself! It's a delicious gin drink made with blueberries. So smooth and delicious. And speaking of Alfie, he was great! Service was amazing.

The stuffed artichokes were the first gone as none of us could stop eating them, they were very crispy and the dipping sauce was so tasteful. The hummus has the perfect flavors and the falafel were one of the best I ever had. The meatballs were good too. For dinner I had the meme chopped salad which was very god and very fresh. The only recommendation I would have for next time is to get light dressing as it was dressed a little more than my preference. After all that we still weren't done, we got the chocolate lava cake dessert... and yes it was as good as it sounds. It's made to order so we had to wait a little but the wait was 100% worth it.

The inside is cute, with chic decor and a display of old fashioned teapots behind the bar. Before ordering, we were given freshly baked bread seeded with Kalamata olives, with a side of olive oil + spices, bell peppers, and olives. We decided to order a few small plates instead of entrees. Hummus - The plate was covered entirely with hummus, and topped with falafel, tahini, and pita. The texture of the hummus was great: smooth and creamy. The falafel was also very tasty, not too dry and starchy like some falafel tends to be. We were a little hesitant to order this plate at first, because we thought it might be little boring, but we were both very happy with our choice! The flavors worked well together and it was a great addition to our meal. Fried Artichoke - I love love love artichoke, and this stuff was incredible! The artichokes were perfectly cooked: crispy, and not at all greasy {you can actually taste the artichoke}. They were topped with manchego cheese, and had two dipping sauces: one tasted like marinara and the second tasted almost like avocado greek yogurt? Not entirely sure, but they were good!Chicken kabob - My bf said the chicken was well-seasoned and pretty standard. I really enjoyed the cucumber yogurt and roasted cherry tomatoes that came with it. Ricotta gnocchi - This gnocchi was drenched in a rich truffle cream and melted in your mouth. It was very tasty and I don't think I've ever gnocchi that was quite like it!

I recommend it for a date night; low lightning, a cozy atmosphere, and cute, rustic decor really set the scene.The food itself is decent, but a bit puzzling. It's clear that thought went into the dishes. The squash salad was tasty and well-balanced. The salmon was well prepared, very savory and the rice complemented it well, but the tomatoes felt out of place. The Gnocchi was a different, disappointing story; while delicious for the first few bites, the flavor quickly became overwhelming and heavy on the tongue. Cons:The service is a big letdown, and the complaint is similar to other 1-3 star reviews. Here's the short version, with a full story if you care for context to follow:They rushed our group at every stage of the dinner, from walking in to leaving the table. We felt distinctly unwelcome through what should have been a pleasant dinner with a friend from out of town.Advice for management. I recommend one of two things:1) If you want to increase your table turnover rate, don't serve tea after the meal is over, since that is an invitation to guests to stay longer.2) If you insist on tea being part of your identity, offer a small follow up menu of small deserts and finger foods to keep the table profitable. This will reduce the pressure on your staff to turn the table over. In either case, you must train your teach the staff not to pressure the guests in this scenario. We were sorely disappointed in the service, which is definitely on the lower end of what Manhattan has to offer. We probably will not return, and cannot in good faith recommend it to friends.Full story:My wife went early to book a table for three, but made clear that one of us (me) would be arriving about 30 minutes later. They said that it'd be fine, as long as at least two people were present out of three. When our friend arrived (making it two), they tried to refuse her a table on the basis that it wasn't three yet.We've worked in the service industry and respect this rule, as it's quite common. However, if they had made this clear as soon as my wife had explained the situation, we would have been happy to find another restaurant. When all three of us were finishing the meal, they kept trying to pick up the check even though we had ordered tea and made no indication that we had put cash or cards in the bill yet. They did this repeatedly, and frequently, to the point that two separate people tried to pick up the check over the span of at most one minute.Finally, as the bill was paid, I remarked that the atmosphere was lovely but the service felt a bit rushed, only to be met with a curt response to the effect of ""We apologize you feel rushed, but we made special accommodations for you.

BAKED MEATBALLS - I'm not even a huge meat person, and I love theseCHOPPED SALAD - can something be light and filling at the same time? That's exactly what this salad is. It's perfectly dressed, topped with just the right amount about of salt, pepper, and feta cheese. Perfect if you are also planning on downing the hummus plate. The staff here has always been patient and attentive. My water glass was never empty. Definitely recommend for anyone in the area!",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

The grilled calamari was to incredible. Very cute date spot, will be returning soon. The Details: After a yelp elite recommended this place, I could not wait to try. As expected, the food was fantastic. They start you off with olive bread, some salty olives, veggies, and spicy olive oil. From there the food just keeps getting better...The grilled calamari was absolutely delicious. It was in a light pesto sauce that must've been mixed with lemon and some other herbs... It was so refreshing and zesty I basically licked the plate (I would have if I was alone). It was a good portion, perfect for 2 to split-- a must try. The Merguez sausage was extremely juicy and flavorful as well. It was served with a heaping portion of hummus and traditional Greek salad. Another winner.Our veggie option was the plate of beets and goat cheese. Delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary.The Damage: We weren't very hungry so we only ordered 2 tapas and a veggie, which came to $17 + tip each (basically free for a nice sit down dinner). However I'd expect on a normal night to order at least 3-4 tapas + veggie so probably double that price.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

The food came out piping hot, and the portion was pretty large. They didn't skimp on the meat and it was very flavorful.The service is good and wait staff is attentive.

I don't pay to come here and get treated like that. We came in a small group. Ordered some apps to start and ordered a few more dishes later on to try and also since one of us came later. But was told that the chef does not like it when we order at different times. Okay....Are we suppose to order everything at one go? This is unheard of. We thought it would serve as a tapas style restaurant but apparently not, we have to order everything at once. How ridiculous! I've never been to any restaurants that told us this..I was drinking my water and did not see the server reaching out the pour my water, we kind of crossed and so I said sorry to her. She gave me such an attitude! Wth! usually they would be oh it's okay! or something.

Everything was ok, but nothing blew my mind. The combination platter dips and veggies are all decent. If I had to pick something off of the plate, it would be the roasted peppers. They were slightly smoky, soft and flavorful. The octopus was charred nicely, the accompanying lettuce was ok, the tomatoes are tossed with some herbs and add nice acid to the dish. My friend and I were catching up and spent a long time with our wine and apps, so I'm guessing or lamb dish was sitting under a heating lamp.... Which meant our requested rare, became more of a medium well (sad). Didn't complain because I knew we were taking awhile, so I appreciate them letting us chat and stay. The lamb itself  (two chops  and a kebab with cubes) were tender and flavorful. The salad was just choooed lettuce with some hummus on the side.

The hostess and waitress were so kind, apologized for our wait which wasn't even that long and were great with helping with what go order.Now I'm not picky per seeeeee but I have been known to eat like an elementary schooler. So luckily I came with a guy who ordered basically the entirety of the menu... and that I came with my sister who is vegan and only ate one of the plates :)We started with the broccoli rabe with I wasn't a fan of and the ceviche and steak tar tar which were amazing. The steak also comes with some bread triangles that I devoured. The ceviche had tuna on the bottom covered in like a salsa and avocado Then we move to the falafel and pita with hummus. WOWZA. I've been to Israel I've gone to restaurants here that are ok and some that are great. This is the greater side. The falafel was crispy and soft without that almost sour taste some places have. The hummus was creamy and not overpowering and the pita WAS SO FLUFFY!!!!Then we had the laffa tacos. I can't even explain how good they are. The taco was a pita, so YES PLEASE. The chicken was cooked to perfection and everything for toppings was on point. Then we got the duck which was also cooked amazingly and a side of fries.

I can't speak for everything (vegetarian so only had the cauliflower, combo platter, mushrooms), but I think the mushrooms were great. It was a really simple dish of lightly sauteed mushrooms and spinach and it was just really well made. Cauliflower was okay. Combo platter was good. Everyone else really liked their meals as well!

Let the stars be what you end up judging it to be.See, I'm visiting and I have a list of spots I want to try in New York. I'm only here for a few days so hitting those spots is important to me. But I unexpectedly was delayed as I meandered through this neighborhood and found myself in a 'time stuck' where I needed to be somewhere next but if I didn't grab a bite now, I'd be starved later. Did a quick Yelp search and this cafe came up looking like a promising choice for where I was at that exact moment. But, I was already bummed it wasn't one of my listed choices. It's a cute corner spot with outdoor sidewalk seating. The staff was welcoming to a single seater.Ordered the Babganoush and the Two way lamb. Everything was delicious. They started me with a few pickles, bread, olive oil, and olives. Best olives I've ever had. My babaganoush came out in a plentiful head but only 4 pieces of pita. It was delicious but I didn't think it was enough pita for the amount of babaganoush. More pita, please. The babaganoush was delicious.I ordered an iced tea. Sadly, no refills. And my glass was FULL of ice which meant I really only got about lessthan half a glass of tea. That was disappointing. I budget slurped the rest of the glass as I enjoyed my meal.My lamb dish was wonderful. Everything about it was perfect. The lamb was tasty and tender. The ratatouille (which I normally don't enjoy) presented enough vegetables to partner with the mashed potatoes. And the salad below my kebab was perfectly dressed (not soupy with dressing).Overall, the meal was done well but I have to admit my own attitude soured the meal a bit. And the ambiance fine except for the 80s music. I LOVE the 80s but it did not complement the ambiance. I would recommend French jazz or something instead.All in all, definitely come here.

It is fresh, flavorful, diverse, and the owners never fail to make you feel like you've just arrived home after a long arduous journey. To start, I recommend the grilled octopus, charred and succulent in its bath of olive oil and spices. Use the tables bread (country and a hearty pecan raisin) to sop up the juices. Pair this with the cool creaminess of the homemade mozzarella. Brunch, lunch, or dinner, Meme has something to offer. My brunch favorites include the grilled shrimp salad (greens heaped with grilled shrimp, roasted peppers, avocado, drizzled in a yogurt tahini dressing), shakshuka (poached eggs nestled inside hearty tomato stew, served with fresh pita and tahini), and the melawach (think Mediterranean scallion pancake with gobs of hummus on top!). For lunch, it's the laffa tacos. Laffa bread cradles grilled shrimp, avocado, chilis, and more. For dinner: chicken tagine. This oven roasted chicken is served in a clay pot, on a bed of couscous with fruits and nuts and all sort of deliciousness. What more could you want?Meme is also turning out some bangin' desserts. You must, I repeat MUST, try their goat cheese panna cotta (pictured). It is one of the best desserts ever dreamed up by man. Get there early, kiddos!

The decor is cool - I especially liked all the teapots on the wall by the bar.I had the steak frites with garlic and parsley sauce. It was underwhelming and for the price, it wasn't worth it. My steak was overcooked so it was very dry. One of the waitresses dropped a bowl filled with Béchamel sauce and spilled some on the back of my boyfriend's shirt.

We wanted to go for a light dinner:- Grilled calamari with cannelini beans: Delicious! I wish I had some bread or couscous to sop up all the zesty dressing it came with. The calamari came out slightly charred, but still tender! If only there was more... a great start, opens up your appetite, and leaves you anticipating for your entree.- Duck breast: Torn on this one. The fat was well rendered, slice into perfect bite sized portions, and accompanied with roasted lemon potatoes. The hint of warm spices from cinnamon and cumin made it perfect for the cool, fall weather. My only complaint is that we ordered it medium rare and it came medium to medium-well so that it wasn't as tender as I'd like it to be. The duck breast was also very small and thin, perhaps that's why it was overcooked. Overall, the taste was good but the downsides still stood out. Service was okay, they were a bit snappy and not the friendliest. Stingy on the bread, which in my opinion left a sour note when we left. But the food was good, priced for the trendy neighborhood.

To start we first got the hummus ($10) which came with pita bread, 4 falafel balls, and tahini. The hummus was really amazing, one of, if not the best, I've had in the city and trust me I know my hummus! It's a pretty good portion especially for the price.I got the octopus salad ($13) and I added a fried egg on top($1). The salad is just a chopped salad with olive oil and lemon and grilled octopus with chickpeas. Super simple but it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It is a little small which is why I added the egg and highly recommend doing so. The other dish we ordered was the shakshuka ($12). It comes with three poached eggs in a tomato sauce with pita bread and tahini. The portion is very large and the sauce is very tasty though I would have liked it better if it was spicy.

They do have a full bar and a restaurant. I really like the outside they had tables outside it looked really cute. We used this location for a photo shoot the owner was extremely nice and accommodating told us that we could call her whenever we would want to do the shoot. The next day we arrived about a half an hour before they opened. the manager that was there setting up the outside tables she had no idea that we were coming. We told the manager that the owner said that we could shoot and she had no problem with it. The manager finish setting up the tables and then we went inside she was so nice she staged everything up for us she had a whole conversation very nice girl down the earth absolute pleasure. One of my friends said that they did have very good food here. We ended up getting drinks here the drinks were very good.

It's dimly lit with candles and definitely cultivates a romantic vibe (my ideal setting, regardless of company). Just walking to the restaurant really put me in the mood.The expansive menu is generous in its offerings. Not only do they serve tapas, but they also have entrees, perhaps dedicated to those not in the spirit of sharing. We ordered a range of tapas (huge portions!) and several entrees to share, all of which tasted amazing.

I am a huuuuge fan of scallops and was so excited for the dish to come out but unfortunately, the flavors/texture just weren't right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the scallops weren't cooked right and I thought they were rather mushy. I also got the chicken kebab with marinated tomatoes and cucumber yogurt.

If you enjoy runny yolk and some zesty tomato sauce, you'll be pleased. Personally, I think this dish could be improved slightly, as I like my shakshuka to have a little more spice.

The walls have small rugs pinned to them high up, or large, old advertisements.Prices are on the cusp of three-$'s, but then again, the two of us were quite full. We split the Spicy Carrots, Fried Artichoke, Sabicha, and the Chicken Tagine (in order of best to worst). The Tagine was a bit of a miss, not quite enough flavor given the description/ingredients.

Top food, quality service and an incredible outdoor seating spot to stare at the social movement of one the best neighborhoods in the city: the west village. Everything in the menu must be delicious because we ordered three plates and they were to die for. The Octopus salad is one the best I had. It has that charcoal grilled flavor that takes you to a happy place. Those almost burnt ends makes it crispy on the outside and so tender in the inside. The lemon Vinagrette is the key element. It dresses everything and unifies the flavors. The usual ingredients complement the dish: chickpeas, fennel and mixed greens. The lobster and eggs... let me tell you, don't even bother to look at the menu, just order this dish. If you ever been at piccolo cafe and ordered the lobster and avocado Croissant, well this is the hash version of it and it kills it! Lobster hash with eggs and bacon, what else can you ask for?? It is a M U S TThe malawach is delicious and it comes with a killer hummus and pesto-like spread. The hard boiled egg is a different and nice touch. I personally prefer the malawach at cafe orlin but this one is very good. They have a home made complimentary bread with butter and jam. Excellent! The dinner menu looks as great as the brunch so we'll be back! Arnold Schwarzenegger style!Finally we came for dinner too. It didn't disappoint us! ordered the Octopus salad again and yes, it was delicious too! wow, what a great way to combine every ingredient and make a superb dish.The Mediterranean platter is great, it comes with several spreads and typical Mediterranean dishes like hummus, falafel, taboule, babganoush, carrot salad, peppers, eggplant salad, etc. Not the best and a little bit spicy but a good platter to share for the table.The risotto is also a nice option, not that big, not that small.

Two of our appetizers came out at the same time but the latter two came at least half an hour later. That's just bizarre. Food: Hit or miss. The small beet salad and the fig appetizer were both incredible. Highly recommend. But the octopus was overcooked and the sauteed mushrooms were a bit bland.

I recognize turnover is essential to a West Village restaurant, but please. And on the off chance I'm being overly dramatic in this review, I overheard the people at the table next to us getting rushed to pay the check, and they talked to each other about how rude the owner was as well.

The tuna civiche was pretty decent but the tacos had dry and unflavorful chicken schwarma in it. It was very messy and the only part about it I liked was the hummus in it (their hummus is very good) and the pita that was used as the ""taco shell."" For our final course we got chicken kabab and the meatballs... very disappointing. The chicken, again was VERY dry. The meatballs were flavorless. The only thing that made these somewhat eatable were the yogurt sauces. Once we were finished I ordered a cocktail called ""The Alfie.""

The chops were literally a cut hanging from a bone and I was tempted to just pick up the bone and eat it right off the bone (which I was not too shy to do).  But it was a very small piece of meat; was this typical for a lamb cut that there's only a small chunk of meat on a piece of bone?? I don't know.  But then again, it occurred to me that restaurants that pride themselves on style, preparation, appearance-presentation, and quality, are probably not concerned with having a big, hankering portion-size to stuff you like a pig (but that's my own little finicky bit there).I'm a Chicago native and my wife is Pacific-coast Colombian, so I expect that any region in the US that is reasonably near an ocean coast will have a very practical and economic access to fresh seafood (which my wife will be the judge since she grew up on the coast), so I could care less that Manhattan is the 'Ooohh-la-la' of NYC.

The chicken meat was falling off the bones and tender. There was a mix of stuff in there, but the lights were dimmed so I couldn't quite see. I believe I tasted almond slices, which I enjoyed.I got a taste of my friend's fried artichokes, and I liked that also. We also got mint tea, which came in individual silver teapots and that was cute. For desserts we got the warm chocolate molten cake and the bread pudding. My friend said that her bread pudding was one of the best she's ever had. I tried it, and I thought it was very yummy.

They suggested I wait at the bar which normally I am fine with, but the bar was completely full and I literally had to stand in the middle of the restaurant between two tables. That was uncomfortable and awkward. They sat us as soon as my friend arrived (thankfully only a few minutes later).

I met a friend for some dinner and we scored one of those outdoor tables (spring is on its way!!!). One thing to note: this place only seats you if your whole party is present. Ok, on to the review.... My friend and I order the Pinot Noir from Oregon (it was good, not mind blowing but, good) and we start to catch up. The waitress came by a few times asking us for our order but, we just weren't ready. The owner came over and asked us to order and was super awkward about it. Needless to say my friend and I felt rushed so we put in our order tapas style. I did see a few entrees come out and they looked magnifique (especially that lemon chicken, still regretting I didn't order that bad boy). Another side note: though this is tapas, our whole meal came out at the same time.The menu was extensive and tapas ranged from about $8-$16 while the entrees were about $16-30. My friend and I went with the combo plate, mussels, and figs wrapped in ham. They sound amazing right? The combo plate rang in at $16 and was a wee bit disappointing. Beets, babaganoush, hummus, tabouli, pita, & falafel. The falafels were small and not fresh, the hummus was delicious but not too much of it. The pita was not warmed and again didn't taste fresh. Not too much love went into this combo platter. I know its a cold dish but, small details can make or break it. I did love me some beets always and the roasted red peppers were pretty weak sauce if you ask me. Not my favorite dish but still enjoyable and definitely large enough to split between 2-3 people.The figs wrapped in ham were burned on the bottom and though the balsamic reduction glaze saved the dish, I can't say I was a fan as the flavor of charred fig remained. Yet as everyone's palet differs, my friend chimed that  she in fact enjoyed them immensely. The mussels were not flavorful, the sauce was weak. I didn't even attempt to soak the remaining mussel bisque with bread; it just lacked any sort of flavor or sustenance.Overall, this place is great place to grab a few tapas and a bottle of vino and sit outside in this lovel city of NY and I'm willing to maybe come back for that lemon chicken but, can't say I was super duper impressed with the sampling from last night.

He brought over a courtesy appetizer and also visited us mid-meal. Nice to not-be-rushed! especially in a small place where table turnover is an issue. Hopefully, I can control myself next visit, as my casual dinner came to about $150!  If you go Tapas, consider everything is about $11, including a glass of wine, so you should be able to get 3 tapas, 4 glasses of wine for 77$, and that is a nice little dinner.

Overall, a very yummy starter!*risotto* - a deliciously decadent risotto with mushroom, corn, butternut squash, and parmesan. The flavors are truly unexpected and the dish managed to be simultaneously rich/creamy and delicate. *grilled octopus* - served with chickpeas and a mesclun/fennel salad.

Great food, nice ambiance, and fairly unobtrusive service.I went with two others, and we all enjoyed and shared our food. We received complimentary appetizers of white bean crostini, which was much better than a bread basket. For appetizers, we split the fried artichokes, which were nothing short of fabulous. They were cooked just right and still juicy and tender, and weren't breaded and deep fried like so much food is now. My compatriot opted for the tabouli, which she was impressed by.For dinner, we all were ecstatic and full at the end. I had the mushroom ravioli, which I thought was superb. I don't like mushrooms in most formats, and have only twice eaten them in a manner where I would do it again - this makes a third time. The ravioli was just right and there was a good balance in the filling so you were not overwhelmed by the mushroom but the flavor was pleasantly enhanced by the parmesan. My companions had the chicken tagine and lamb shank tagine, and they were both impressed. As a vegetarian,  I don't have much to add on their dishes as I did not try them. We were so full that we couldn't even consider dessert, but perhaps next time. They do not take reservations, so be prepared to wait or sit with others (depending on how many are in your party and if you are seated at the main table). I never had to ask for my water to be refilled, which was a positive note, but the waiter did refill it twice by reaching between my dinner companions, which I didn't appreciate.Food was great, dinner was lovely, and I would come back in a heartbeat.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

The eggs came back with egg yolk but I was still charged for the whites only. I didn't enjoy the eggs at all. We also asked to sit inside and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. We decided to try sitting outside because the sun was directly above us and the tables were warm. Almost immediately after sitting down, the sun went behind the building and we were instantly freezing. We asked to please be put back on the list to eat inside. The manager ignored our request in favor of seating new customers so we remained outside for the next hour.

286,PG1sGQlkZMjsA_VyiV7jLg,Stephanie Y.,5.0 star rating,"Excellent Mediterranean in the West Village! Came here Friday night around 8:30-9pm with my bf for a homey date. And it's PERFECT for that... or an intimate catch-up with a gf, or a fam dinner or group outing. It's cozy, and quaint, filled with cute beachy decor, nice service and great food- and it's in the Village. CUTE CUTE CUTE. We didn't even need a res to sit at prime time- in fact, we got a great table in the corner. Very romantic. If you wanted to dine al fresco though, it might have been a wait (there are quite a few tables outside, too). Immediately our waiter came by and gave us the specials- an app with figs wrapped with bacon (yum but didn't apply to our diets), and wild stripped bass..which I heard later they ran out of. I asked him for his favs and he def recommended the octopus, chicken tagine (both of which we got..more of this later). We started with classic bread (olive bread I think) and the dips- EVOO, picked veggies, and olives. Olives were great, so was the olive oil. The veggies didn't do much...they weren't as sour as I wanted. The bread itself was a bit hard. But not a big deal. We ordered the chopped salad, which was the closest thing to a Greek- feta, romaine, tomatoes, onion..can't remember if there was anything exotic. It was pretty standard. It came with really good pita though- it wasn't super soft, it was somewhat fried/grilled... but delicious. We split the rest. Meme offers big entrees, as well as tapas (WHICH I LOVE- love to share and try different things :)  ). The menu is really varied, which is wonderful- lotsa options.  We wanted to just get the octo, and the tagine to share. The octo was AWESOME. Second to Alta (my fav baby octo)- it was the right texture, super soft inside and grilled on the outside. My only qualm is that it was very doused in vinegar/oil, so it was a bit too soggy. The greens it came with were very fresh, as were the fresh soaked chickpeas. Yum. The tagine took a while. But we had the salad, and octo come up first, which was nice- the waiter asked us how we wanted to pace our meal. For a casual place, expect service to be top-notich. Our waiter was polite, knowledgable, prompt...he services pretty much the whole restaurant too. He looked Greek too..haha or Moroccan, maybe that helps! (Note this place is truly Mediterranean, not just Greek, i.e. tagine is Moroccan). The tagine could have been a bit small...it is designed for one, but it was really good. Quality over quantity. There was a few interesting ingredients in that stew.Blueberries or tasteless capers for one...haha. This has not yet been confirmed. There was apricot too. The best part was that it was very, very slow cooked...meat so tender...ah.. Yum. Bf and I had had terrible tagine experience in the place (the namesake restaurant in Hell Kitch... that's forsaken in our books).Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. Everything just looked so good. It's not as true of a Greek menu as say, Snack Taverna- the other banging Med. place in the 'hood, BUT they do offer a bunch of things. Pretty sure I was steak frites.My bf was really sweet and ordered the St. George wine, which was 34 for a bottle. You can get it only from Greece- it was a fruity red, nothing smoked, nothing dry. Apps in the high digits, salad around 10, and entrees in the high teens, 20s. For the quality of food, it was really, really a good deal. GO!

However, it may not have been the best choice for date night because 1) it is super LOUD. I'm not sure I would have been able to hear my boyfriend even if he were sitting right next to me. You hear your neighbor's business, and your neighbor's neighbor's business, and basically the entire place seats about 50 people and I could hear all of them. 2) Service is very friendly, sometimes to the extent of sitting down next to regulars and chatting. While this certainly shows they have good relationships, I caught the owner trying to get the attention of the sitting waitstaff a couple of times, and I wouldn't have wanted the waiter making my night more awkward if I didn't know my date already. When we were waiting to get seated, the owner just kind of flapped dismissively towards a table and then was just chatting with customers in the entry way, making it hard for anybody to get in or not. Food: Ohhh the moussaka. Come for the moussaka. People apparently do from all over. It is just amazingness in your mouth.Fried artichokes - these were not what I expected, but they were even better. I even at the one that fell on the table. Holy cow the short rib (no pun intended) - we made a game time decision to order this as well, and I am so glad we did. It was rich without being cloying and fell apart to the touch. I did find a piece of paper, oddly, in my mashed potatoes, and didn't get much more than a ""whoops"" apology, and we didn't get offered dessert.

We were told we had to wait about 5-10min and were given the choice of either waiting at the bar or simply stand outside. Eventually waited about 15min or so. But I'd say the turnover is quite high. Each table is really eat, pay and go. Grilled octopus: This was very yummy. The octopus was cut into bite size pieces. They were soft and delicious. Not too salty. Just nice! The tomato with lemon (sweet, slightly sour, juicy and savory) went very well with the grilled octopus. I normally don't eat chickpeas because the taste is too strong, but this was fresh and tasted good. The ingredients on the whole plate blended very well together. Almond crusted sea scallops:The sea scallops were well done - not overcooked, but just nice to retain the juice in it and succulent meat when placed in your mouth. The almonds gave a really nice bite to it since the scallops pretty much melted. And the cauliflower puree was heaven. Try the scallops without the puree first to get its natural flavor and then dip the next bite into the puree. You'll lick them all clean!2-way lamb:I found this disappointing actually. The lamb chops were too tough, dry and hard. It was difficult to eat. But the kebab saved the dish with the tasty hummus at the side.

The meat fell right off the bone. The serving sizes were just right.The service was also phenomenal, making a tasty meal into an overall delightful evening. Our server, Taylor, was wonderful.

I was there for a celebration with my husband and although we loved the food: hummus, meatballs, 2-way lamb, shrimp & chorizo, house salad; we were not blown away to give a 4-star or 5-star. Let's see, here is what we thinking you should keep in mind:1. The raising bread you get at the beginning is good, but it would be nice to have more than a slice cut into 2 pieces2. Hummus: we are used to a more firm texture and although the hummus was great, it seemed watered down. You also barely get enough hummus for 2 people and like 8 small pieces of Pita3. The meatballs were awesome, I really did like this new dish in my list of Mediterranean food. The best part of it was the yogurt that came with it as it really adds this delicious distinct taste4. The House Salad is really good, but at $9, it is a bit small, perhaps $6 would be a better price5. 2-way lamb was very nice because it was accompanied by a little salad, hummus, mashed pot, and roasted peppers and onions6. The Shrimp & chorizo had like 3 small shrimps and a round cut of chorizo here and there, so I was not impressedOverall, I think the place is pricy, but would give it another shot in the future. I guess if I had not been to other Mediterranean restaurants, I would say this is the best, but it is not. It also kindda bothered me that I felt the waitstaff was constantly looking our way most likely because we were one of two couples in the place, but this just added to the discomfort.

This is mémé, and it is a reasonably priced, enchanting little spot to grab a light bite in the style of Midterranean tapas. Forget the right side of the menu and order strictly from the left. Get a number of small plates to share with your friends and order a bottle of wine to split. The food is impeccable, the service is attentive, and the ambience is unbeatable. My favorites from our night out were the fried artichokes with manchego cheese, grilled calamari, shrimp and chorizo, and the beets with goat cheese and pine nuts. Next time I come here I would love to try some of the other small plates thay have on the menu. To emphasize how much mémé exudes an aura of romance, as our table of 6 was preparing to leave, a charismatic little man with an enormous guitar approached us and began to serenade us right outside of the restaurant -- and we were so filled with delicious food and happiness that we actually began to dance in the middle of the street to his singing and guitar-playing.

A great place for a first date.  It's not overly romantic but enough to set a soft mellow mood.  Not set for a large party. We had five people for dinner and hardly had any space to move. There is a bar and but only about four seats to sit down.    Great wine list, if you like white wine please give their Riesling a try. I loved it and its about $12 per glass. I read Yelp prior to ordering and took some Yelpers advice. I loved their appetizer plater which consist of couscous , hummus, fresh beets and pita. The hummus is the best I ever had. It's so fresh, cool and bursting with flavor.  I  find it so humorous that instead of trying something new like mushrooms with hazelnut truffle oil  ( sounds yummy)  I settled for pasta with seafood.  I am so disappointed at myself for not trying something new. Well my entree was good but definitely had better . My boyfriend and brother had lamb for their entree and since I don't eat lamb ... not able to comment on it.  However according to them, it was the  most soft lamb meat they ever tried. My sister in-law tried the beef with mash potatoes and that was delicious. My mother had the fish but I don't remember the taste of it now so I won't be commenting on it.      Well for dessert we ordered three chocolate lava cakes and the pana cotta. I must say the chocolate lava cake was awesome. Kudos to the chef for that marvel on a plate . However, it was my first time trying a pana cotta and I must say ,... not a big fan of it. The panna cotta was heavy and lacked a certain finish. Of course I have nothing to compare it to and I never tried it  so my opinion may be biased.  Now for the service, I must say it was great, awesome and let's add fun. The waiters were funny and adorable. Now for the three stars. I hate to say this but the bill we received was unbelievable. Of course, as we ordered we saw the prices and had a idea but it was way more than we expected. However, since it was a birthday dinner no one checked and questioned the bill. Truthfully i had  better meals for larger parties for lower prices.  This could be our fault for not being more responsible.

The best shashuka I have ever had in the city. It is not as heavy as the versions in other restaurants - Dell Anima and Normandy, both in the W.V. . No cheese added or sausage  though you can ask for it. It is just freshly made tomato sauce, onion, green pepper, olive oil and baked eggs with runny yolks! Yum and healthy! The tahini sauce comes with the pita bread is tangy and nutty. I could almost just eat it on its own without the bread!The hummus app and grilled octopus were also good. But I was running out of stomach space!Very important to make your visit even more enjoyable, especially on a sunny day - get the seats by the window or just sit outside.

I got a normal entree - eggs benedict and added smoked salmon. Delicious! Perfectly poached bursting with yolk eggs. Slightly lemon-y, lighter than average hollandaise. Nicely done, not too sinful or heavy. Perfect amount of potatoes on the side, and nice chunky bits of green and red pepper to boot. All very gourmet, and at prices that aren't too explosive given the chi chi-ness of this particular HOOD. Orange juice was aaaaahhhhmaaaaayyyyziiiiiiing. Fresh squeezed....And $5. Which is a lot.

We loved everything except for the roasted red peppers, something was off. Also, once you're seated they present bread and a small plate of olives, pickled celery and carrots and olive oil. All flavorful and tasty. We then shared the lamb burger with fries that was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. I make lamb burgers/sliders frequently at home and I thought that these were better than mine. Served on a chunk of a sesame baguette with goat cheese it was delicious and highly recommend.Service was also great the entire time and when i went to use the restroom the inside of the place looked darling.

I ordered the Steak Frite and my friend ordered a duck dish.Our dinner started out ok.  We were served a standard antipasta trio of olives, olive oil and cured veggies.  My first reaction was, ""What are we supposed to do with the olive oil on this plate. Is there any bread?""  I noticed the people sitting next to me had bread on their plates.We had to wait 5 minutes just to get bread to dip into the olive oil.  The waitstaff brought over two slices (sandwich sliced size) of bread for each person with some tongs.  Not nearly enough bread to accommodate the olive oil. It's bread, how stingy can you get?Our plates both arrived together, and I was astonished to see the disparity  of portion size of my friend's dish.  I literally had more than double the amount of food on my plate.I also looked around at the other tables and noted that most plates were around the same portion size as mine which was medium to generous.  It seemed odd that this duck dish was half the size of all other entrees at the restaurant. I have eaten in Marcus Samuelson's restaurants or similar ilk where a veggie entree would consists of 3 peas on a plate, but in those cases, the portions are consistently tiny across the board.  Small or large, one should expect consistency with portion sizes in a particular restaurant.When I cut into my NY strip steak which was ordered ""medium rare"", it cut like a hockey puck.  I probably would not have looked down at it had it sliced a little easier in the first place. I looked down and I could see ZERO pink.  So I sliced into the center, and it was brown with a tiny amount barely pink. Essentially, my outer portion of the cook was medium well, while the inner was medium. See link for an illustration of what I saw.  colinmcnulty.com/blog/20…Given that this dish was $25 I took the advice of Wayne Dyer and sent it back.  Why should I have to pay a good amount of money for this when at best only a tiny portion of the steak was cooked even medium?  So a few minutes later, the waitress brings my steak back with it completely cut in half and says, ""the chef says this is medium rare see. It's just that the ends were cooked a little more.""  First, if you are a chef and you cook steak, you are supposed to cook it evenly through out.  I know it can be challenging.  That's why he is a chef by profession and I am not!Second, since when are you supposed to tell a customer they are wrong about the food? Even if they are wrong, that's not good business.Now I am an avid watcher of cooking shows, especially cooking competitions where the celebrity chefs are constantly berating the challengers on issues just like that.  It's been quite an education. Also, my ex-husband cooked in 4 star restaurants under the tutelage of Patrick Clark, David Boulez, Judy Rodgers.  He even worked with Tom Colicchio.  I think I know how a steak should be cooked and how it should feel under a knife, and clearly this was not cooked properly.So I sent it back and ordered it ""rare"". I'm not crazy about rare, but I thought I might get something closer to what I want by doing so. Well I got the steak back, and it was certainly rare. At this point, my friend had already finished eating so I decided to grin it and bare it.  It still cut like a hockey puck. I'm sure this meat didn't rest.  It came with a garlic sauce that was sparse and there didn't seem to be ANY juices from the steak at all.  I know you aren't supposed to serve customers a bloody plate, but there were no juices at all. The rest of my plate was ok. The fries were tasty and crisp. The salad was ok but really over-dressed with olive oil.  My friend was so hungry that we ended up stopping for pizza after the meal.At the end of my meal, my stomach felt a little off.  Maybe because my mind had trouble eating a rare steak, or perhaps it was the excess olive oil on my salad. Not sure. We won't be doing  business there again.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

At about 7:30, there was another three people group arrived and it seemed they knew the manager. Another half an hour went by, we couldn't wait but talked to the manager. The manager then asked us to keep waiting because apparently he thought ""his friends"" arrived early than us and told us ""there is another group before you"". It was the most frizzing day in New York, and this experience made me never want to come back again.

383,PN59iqvG0IaeEhG_db9r2g,J M.,1.0 star rating,"When I originally wrote this review, I wanted to express my disappointment about price and service. But now that I've recovered from feeling quite nauseous yesterday afternoon, there is one other thing worth mentioning. There's a TON of oil and butter in everything, especially the vegetables. While you may find this strange and hard to believe, the heavily oiled meal at Meme caused me to feel acute nausea and dizziness the following afternoon. It was the same feeling I had the day after last year's Christmas party after eating a lot of deep fried hors d'oeuvres (and only having one beer) at the party. In short, I couldn't function at work. My stomach was pained the whole day and I probably used the bathroom four times. I was so exhausted while my body tried to purge the oils, as embarrassing as it is for me to admit, I had to sleep on the floor of an empty office for fifteen minutes because I could not function at my desk. The afternoon following dinner at Meme, I felt the same painful nausea. Everything was difficult, even walking left me feeling dizzy. For those who maintain a low-oil diet, consider this a warning before eating at Meme. But for all of you, I think when a restaurant uses so much oil and butter, it's usually to mask the otherwise mediocre quality produce being served.So as far as the two things I originally wrote about the restaurant:  1) I think the trap the restaurant falls into, like so many in the West Village, is that the price you are paying is the price of the rent. This means the quality of the food is scrimped for them to stay in business. For example, instead of an entrée, I ordered three of the small plates. The servings are small, and at $11 to $12 each, you really need three of them, so $33 to $36, to match the size of an entrée. Additionally with regards to quality, the Meme salad, ordered by someone at our table, was nothing more than iceberg lettuce with vinegar and pita wedges.     2) One member of our party, allergic to dairy, ordered a chicken dish. When it came out, it appeared to be cooked in butter. The menu indicated a ""wine"" sauce but not a ""butter"" sauce. We kindly asked the waitress to return the dish, which she did, so it could be replaced. But what was irritating was afterwards the manager approached our table and told us ""we should have let them know about any allergies in advance and that the restaurant doesn't list every single ingredient in our menu for a reason.""Whether the restaurant is at fault for not explicating each ingredient, or whether we are at fault for not sharing food allergies in advance is not what bothered me most. It was the tone the manager took and the blame he assigned to our party. Think of the rare companies and places where you find great customer service. They always take the responsibility and remain apologetic for the error. If this were a small, chain restaurant off the interstate, I'd forgive a manager who doesn't know or care about customer service. But this is the West Village. A manager without customer service skills in this neighborhood is no manager indeed.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

Delicious! It's their specialty and definitely worth trying.They also offer $5 standard brunch drinks such as mimosa, bellini etc. I'm a little finicky about the OJ that goes into my mimosa so I asked the waitress whether it was fresh squeezed. She replied that although they do offer fresh squeezed OJ as a separate drink, the OJ in the mimosa is out of a carton (the brunch mimosa being a discount drink and all). So I just opted for fresh OJ.Each of us got coffee or a drink plus one brunch entree and total with tip came to about $20...very reasonable.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

Also, they had kept the door to the restaurant open and it was pretty cold everyone inside was wearing their jackets and when we asked a waitress to close the door she said and I quote, ""but I'm literally sweating."" When we received our couscous one of the waitresses took the soup and literally spilled it into the bowl and it looked like soup (which is not the right way to present it). It should be up to our discretion how much soup we want. These girls need to have a manager watching them otherwise it will ruin the experience for customers.

My friend that got the omelet didn't eat it.  I didn't even realize until she passed her full plate back at the end... and the eggs were running all over the plate.  She's much too nice to say anything or send plates back.  My other friend got the beef burger and requested medium.  When she says medium, she gets nervous about pink centers, but we reassured her a little pink was okay.  She took three bites... and was too squeamish so she sliced the burger horizontally to expose a nearly raw middle.  The burger wasn't even medium rare... it was definitely rare! When she told the server he actually looked disgusted and apologized and promptly removed it from our check.  Not sure if the dinner menu is much better, but as far as brunch, I won't be stopping by again.  Unfortunately,  I struck out with my out of town visitors, but it was a beautiful day in the West Village, and they enjoyed ambiance.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

To be fair, I only tried page one of the menu - we didn't try any of the entrees. Let's get right to the food.Fried Artichoke ($10) - I asked for waiter recommendations on some tapas dishes. He suggested a number of options - he talked about half of the available tapas. We chose from his recommendations. This one was exactly as it sounds - fried artichokes. Not sure why we got it. Meh.Meat Sambusak ($9) - ground beef in a pastry. You get three of them. The dish was straightforward, and not very exciting, but admittedly pretty tasty.Baked Meatballs ($10) - probably the best dish we had. The meatballs themselves were fine, but the sauce was very good, and the onions, yogurt, and mint worked well with the dish. This was a solid 3 star dish.Grilled Octopus ($12) - reasonable octopus, I guess. No real complaints here. I'm not sure octopus is my favorite, unless it's very high quality, which this was not.Overall, the food was just okay. They do give you a little mediterranean platter for free to start the meal, which was a nice touch (some pickled vegetables, olives, and olive oil), and a bread guy comes around with a basket of bread and places one on your bread dish.

Accidents happen, not her fault.  The owner was shooting the waitress death stares & also didn't offer my friend a napkin or water to clean up or offer a drink or anything.  Double service fail.Anyway, good enough & I'll probably be back for the well-priced, large-portioned, neighborhood fare.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

So he got my friend's order wrong and she had to wait for them to make the right dish. Some of my food was raw on the inside and had to be sent back to be cooked some more which was not necessarily his fault but contributed to the rushed feeling of this restaurant; they were not taking enough time to cook the food.

So here come the goods:We decided to share a bunch of tapas (even though the entrees were extremely reasonably priced and looked great). We got the Hummus plate - super fresh and homemade-tasting, with some bonus falafel on top!; the Shrimp & Chorizo - delicious; some Scallops - tender and tasty; and the Grilled Octopus - highlight of the meal - cooked and seasoned to perfection, with the most delightful little salad on the side.

It's like mediterranean tapas - hummus and feta and that sort of stuff. We were seated outside (yay for seating) and our server was really really nice.We got 1. The Octopus: SOOO GOOD! It's really tender octopus with chickpeas and other vegetables and it was really delicious2. Shrimp with chorizo: this was just ok. The shrimp was a little chewy and the sauce had peppers and chorizo in it but was really greasy. Had no interest in dunking any bread in that sauce. The number of shrimp was not that much either.3. I forgot what it's called but look for it in the description: it was a pastry stuffed with ground lamb and served with marinara sauce. Three come in a serving and it was so tasty we ordered another round!4. The Gnocchi in truffle cream sauce: gnocchi was light as air and tender and you could taste the truffle.The food was delicious and exactly what we were looking for on a warm weekday!

We went with a couple of glasses of the Tempranillo while we waited. Very nice.The service was very friendly and we were surprised with salmon tartare drizzled with lemon creme fraiche on toast as freebie gifts while at the bar. Scrumptious.Dinner was fantastic and the service was spot on. We didn't feel rushed at all. Started with the mussels and the veggie appetizer platter, featuring some very delicious carrots and beets along with baba-ganoush and an unusually good taboule, which appeared to be made with brown (or wild) rice instead of couscous. After that we were too full to order a full entree, so we split a butternut squash salad and the sauteed wild mushrooms on spinach dish. Everything was extremely tasty and satisfying.Would definitely recommend Meme to my friends and will be back as soon as possible to try some of the other dishes.PS: Magnolia Bakery is a couple blocks away on Bleecker Street.

Bf liked his lamb although he would have preferred a larger portion (at 6'5"" my love would need a tad bit bigger portion). I loved my bass as it was cooked to perfection with the skin just tender enough to be eaten. The only thing was that my saffron rice was slightly undercooked.

I signed up for yelp just to comment on this place. My girlfriend and I had gone there one one of our first dates and really enjoyed our tapas, and had been saying for several months we needed to try it again.  We went there yesterday and I really must say, it's a home run.They start you off with a nice little sampler of veggies in oil, olives and fresh bread.  We did another round of tapas, this time largely of selections we didn't sample the first time... delicious. The almond crusted scallops were cooked perfectly with a very nice sauce; the chicken kebab was juicy and the cucumber yogurt was fantastic. The food is spiced well. It's not hot, but it's not bland. Right up my alley at least. Our favorite has become the beets with goat cheese and pine nuts. I would suggest it as a starter for anyone going there. The ricotta gnocchi were the only ""bland"" thing we had, but I feel ricotta doesn't pack a big punch, and gnocchi themselves are generally, well, tasteless, regardless of where you get them. Meat sambusak also pretty good. The first time we went I had the foie gras crostini, also excellent. Some folks around us had entrees which we overheard them saying were very good the first time, and a gentleman by us ordered the salmon entree that looked absolutely great. The service at this restaurant is excellent as well. Our waiter was well versed in each of the dishes and held strong opinions on them, which I think is important in a restaurant, that the wait staff knows what they're serving. He also offered a wine to pair based on our selections. The decor is simple but inviting. Sometimes ""less is more."" The portions on the tapas are sized so that two can share 4-5 as a ""dinner"" or ""lunch"" to get a nice ""tour"" of the menu where you will leave full, but not stuffed. One entree per person is plenty.  Only thing keeping this away from a 5 is that we haven't been there to eat entrees yet. That's on my to do list very soon. Once that happens, it would take a ""kitchen nightmares"" situation for it not to be a 5. I'll be sure to review it when we try it again.

Corn, avocado, tomato... yum.- the black mission figs (small plate). ohmygod, so good. figs wrapped in grilled ham and mozzarella with balsamic reduction. i could eat 10 of these (and one time did actually order ""another round."" don't judge).- Meme Couscous (entree). This is so hearty but really healthy, perfect for the wintertime. It's really flavorful but simple, with couscous, veggies, chicken, and mergueze sausage. It comes with fresh harissa but I always eat it plain, it's just so good.- Duck (entree). Perfectly cooked, with a sweet orange sauce and roasted veggies, it's an awesome salty-sweet-savory dinner.

The space is attractive, if a bit small. The welcome was...well, welcoming and we were seated right away at 6:30 on a Monday night. Immediately, a plate of olives and pickled veggies were placed on the table along with fresh and tasty olive bread. Then...and this was a surprise...an amuse bouche was put on the table! I didn't expect that at such a casual restaurant, but it was certainly welcome.  It was a crostini with salmon tartare and some sort of cream on top and it was delicious!We both got salads. Mine was mixed greens with roasted butternut squash, pumpkin seeds and sauteed halloumi cheese. Every aspect of the dish was perfect...very fresh greens, sweet and perfectly cooked squash, but the highlight was the cheese...brown and crusty on the outside, firm and a bit tangy on the inside. I loved it! My date's salad was arugula with goat cheese, pistachios and pomegranate seeds. He was happy.My entree was a special....seafood and chorizo paella. Now, I have not been impressed with paella in this country. More often than not it tastes like rice-a-roni with frozen, overcooked seafood and frozen peas. Then I had a life-changing paella in Barcelona. I literally cried, it was so good. I've been searching for something comparable here and I have to say, I still haven't found it, but this was the closest I have found. Served in a small personal paella pan, the proper paella rice had obviously been cooked in a seafood (I think) stock to infuse it with flavor. I would have liked a little more saffron and pimento and there wasn't the crust on the bottom, but it was the tastiest rice I've had in paella here. The seafood was fresh...3 giant shrimp, mussels and clams...and the tasty chorizo was sliced thin. A bit of grit in one mussel, but that didn't bother me. The serving was generous, too. My date had the chicken tagine. I tasted the fragrant dish and it was delicious too. The chicken fell off the bone and the sweet spices and preserved lemon were balanced perfectly.We skipped dessert...we were too full...but then we saw desserts put on the table next to us and we almost changed our mind.

The restaurant is cozy and cute with modern touches - very romantic for our date night. We started with the combination platter, which was plenty appetizer for two of us. I love all the variety - standouts include the fluffy pita, garlicky carrots, and spicy peppers. We ordered three tapas plates for two of us to share - on top of the appetizer it was plenty of food. The yellowfin tuna ceviche had a great citrus flavor, and the texture of the tuna was perfect. The baked meatballs were moist and flavorful, with an amazing tangy yogurt sauce. The dish had four large meatballs which I thought was a great portion. And the ricotta gnocchi - you must have it. Unlike most restaurants, the gnocchi was not overcooked - it was incredibly soft, smooth, melt-in-your-mouth. And it comes with an amazing truffle sauce. I would say I could eat a hundred of these, but they are so incredibly rich and flavorful that the small plate was plenty for us to share. I truly cannot recommend these dishes enough. We topped off our meal with two great glasses of wine and a Negroni. The service was amazing - our server was down-to-earth, very helpful and personable. The owner even came by to chat with us for a bit. I will absolutely be back to Meme and will recommend it to all of my friends in the meantime.

I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to seat us immediately around 7 on a Saturday night. The restaurant is very small. It took some time for them to bring us menus. When we went to order, they were out of the wine and the figs appetizer we wanted (not a big deal, but not a strong start). We ordered the butternut Squash and hallumi salad which was the best part of our meal, which isn't saying much. It was good but really nothing special.  The babaganoush was okay but a little under-seasoned and would have been better if it were smokier.  To top it off, the bowl came with four triangles of pita, definitely not enough to scoop it up with. Luckily, we weren't interested in finishing it. I also ordered the lobster cakes. I specifically asked if they had pepper and was assured they did not.  While the cakes themselves didn't, they were covered in a salsa that did. The cakes themselves were okay but nothing special.  My friend had the risotto which was overcooked and under-seasoned. Instead of serving us in courses at our tiny table, all the food came at once, making the table crowded and made us full rushed. Overall, the food was disappointing.  The women at the table next to us sat at their table forever. When we had just paid the bill and I still had a full beer, we were asked to finish our drinks at the bar.  While I would have understood if we had been lingering as the women next to us had been, we weren't.  The whole thing felt a little rushed. Based on my experience, I'm honestly shocked to see reviews this high.

It was a lovely Saturday night and was able to get a table outside (Hudson Street is great people watching by the way).  Definitely try the heirloom tomato salad.   Delicious!  The dining experience would have Been perfect if it weren't for the loud chatty Kathy next to me; why did I have to hear her story about the cheap tampons she bought at a new website, but I digress.  The food is tasty, wait staff nice, and prices good.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

It was really hot and humid out, so we got a cold refreshing bottle of white wine to start.....and lots of glasses of water! Started with the ceviche, which was melt in your mouth delicious, the betts with goatcheese - always a favorite of mine, and the fried artichokes. Everything was great, and then we shared the sea bass dish, which was one of the specials that night. We both enjoyed our meal, sat, talked and drank our wine, had a great time!",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

It is the most flavorful thing I've had in recent memory- absolutely delicious! I also ordered a salad, which wasn't great. The waitress was nice. Overall, I don't think I'd go back because it was overpriced.",Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

512,DFV7Y3bUt2NVWBM9PqinMA,Nishant S.,5.0 star rating,Pretty damn good. Came for brunch and may now be my favorite brunch spot in the city. Their merguez is just the right touch of spicy and flavor. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and their bread is fantastic. Surprisingly their french fries are also amazing. Another plus - went in with two young kids and they were really accommodating and very friendly.,Mémé Mediterranean,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Salad,, Seafood"

A friend of mine arrived before my husband and myself and was not warmly greeted or offered to wait until the rest of her party arrived. Way to sour a perfectly nice evening... Putting this guy aside (I'm a native New Yorker, I can handle it!), the atmosphere was cozy and I had a fantastic dinner.
