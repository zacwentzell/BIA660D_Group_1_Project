I got sick at some places, had bad butter and bagels that were hard as a rock. I was losing hope on Hoboken bagels. Then, my roommates and I found O'Bagel...This is now our go to spot. From plain bagels, to breakfast sandwiches, everything is fresh and absolutely delicious. The interior is also very nice for a bagel shop! The only downside is the wait time. A huge line forms on the weekends and the inside gets very hot. However, I will say these bagels are absolutely worth it. Go enjoy!",O’Bagel,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

Finally I made it to O'Bagel bringing my exhaustive search to a finale - and what a finale it is!Not only do they offer a wonderful selection of hand rolled fresh, doughy, flavor packed bagels, but they have a huge creative and delicious selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches.

Most people do not call Hoboken their hometown, so the majority of us can and will say that their hometown bagel shop reigns supreme, and for some of you that may very well be O'bagel. I can honestly say that this place has some very quality bagels that will give your hometown bagel shop a run for its money...Minus one star for the long wait, as I have spent close to 45 minutes waiting for a bagel on a busy weekend morning.

If I could give it 0 stars I would only because their service has to be one of the worst I have experienced. Three times now I have gone in on my walk to work to grab a dozen bagels, not sandwiches, just bag of bagels. I had to wait 30 minutes each time and had to ask a worker to get my bagels because I would be late to work. Owner needs to figure it out, hire someone else, your service is garbage. Also went in on a Friday morning at 730 am and someone ordered 10 bags of bagels. Only flavor left for customers was plain and egg. Be ready for orders so people aren't left with no selection.

I placed my order for an everything bagel with lox cream cheese spread and a marble rye bagel with butter to go.  The young order taker asked me if I wanted it with the scallions. The perplexed look on my face prompted her to ask one of her associates do we have lox Cream cheese spread?  Her coworker and I both assured her there was a huge bowl of lox cream cheese spread in the refrigerator case.   Perhaps management should educate the employees on the menu. There were 3 people ahead of me & I had my order in about 10 minutes.The lox cream cheese was very tasty, fresh & not salty.  The bagels have a perfect chewy texture.

57,6q9QKgww7N1HK0HRx9rnFA,Jonathan S.,1.0 star rating,"It's unfortunate how terrible the customer service is here because the bagels are decent. Recently had a delivery order of a half dozen bagels that showed up completely wrong. When I called the restaurant, I could barely hear the person on the phone due to background noise, and they couldn't hear me either. This person didn't know what to do with my issue so they gave me to the manager.The manager reviewed my order and then told me that the reason I didn't get the bagel flavors I wanted was that they were out so they just subbed in other ones. And they did this without calling first. I told her that this is an unfortunate problem because now I have a bunch of bagels that won't be eaten, and family who don't have bagels they like to eat! And what did she say to that? Nothing. Silence.So let's recap here. I order a product from you. You're out of the product I want, so you give me something different without consulting me, just assuming I'll want that. And when I tell you that's not what I wanted, you don't offer any sort of consolation? That's not how you do business. They should have offered me the ability to change or cancel my order before they delivered it.Oh, and my other gripe about this place? They charge $3.75 for a TINY container of scallion cream cheese! Look at my picture - metro card for scale. It's the size of one of those little cups you're supposed to put ketchup in at a fast food place!

During the morning rush, be prepared to wait a while. However, if you know what you want and order it on yelp via pickup, it'll save you a lot of time. The only thing I didn't necessarily like about the pickup process is that since the line is usually long at the register, and people are ordering left and right, it confused me for a bit on where/how I could ask for my pickup order when I actually got to the store.

Bagels are rolled by hand here, and you can watch the guy cutting the dough and rolling bagels by hand behind the counter. Bagels themselves have a nice crunch crust, with a soft chewy inside. Pretty tasty. The bad? The bagels have no stuff in them. Both the sesame and everything bagels barely had anything in them. The sesame could have passed for a plain. The other thing is serving of tuna on the bagel felt pretty stingy compared to other places in Hoboken. Place feels a bit pricy coming to $12 for a bagel with cream cheese, and another bagel with tuna. Will I come back?

And when I go to a bagel shop, I don't care how good their coffee is, if they offer seating, if they have other items on their menu, etc. I go to a bagel shop to get a bagel.Bagels should be a little dense and chewy. OBagel's bagels are too bready and don't even look like bagels! Also the first time I went to OBagel, they didn't let the bagels cool out of the oven so when they put the cream cheese on, it immediately got all gooey and nasty. No, no, no.I gave them another shot and this time, I wanted to do a side by side comparison of OBagel and Hoboken Hot Bagel. First, the bagel from Hoboken Hot Bagel actually looks like a bagel and feels like a bagel. Use your finger and push into the bagel to test the density -- the bagel from OBagel gives too easily.Texture, taste, mouthfeel: Hoboken Hot Bagel wins hands down. The OBagel bagel is bland, too soft/fluffy. Just because a bagel is freshly baked does not make it a good bagel. There is a *right* way to make a bagel and OBagel fails.

So this is a really great addition to town.I ordered an egg and cheese on a whole grain everything bagel (I love they have whole grain everything bagels) and it was really good. A bagel sandwich isn't a culinary masterpiece but it was good and the bagel was chewy and delicious.  The wife got the same bagel with just cream cheese, which was equally as good.Yes they are new and need to work out some kinks, like ordering and how many registers.

I am stuck between 3 and 4 stars, which is the inevitable flaw to yelp, the lack of the 0.5 option. I guess its good because it makes us decide. Though you provide me with a delicious Jersey bagel, your pricing, service, and store set up results in the loss of 2 stars. Taste: Let's start with the best part. Yes, they have the best bagel in town, in the state, and perhaps the universe. There I said it. I know its a bold statement, but its the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and soft but with some weight on the inside. Great variation of flavors of bagels, cream cheeses, and sandwich options, and fresh as can be. Service: Here is where life takes a nose dive for me. They are very slow, as in prepare to spend 30 mins there just to get a bagel. If you have no where else to be, then by all means, wait it out. They also have a rough time taking orders. A few times when I have been there I have had to repeat myself to the cashier, even when I am just ordering for one person. Want to order for a few people, I wish you luck. Then, there is the inevitable, ""we forgot to give you something"" in your order situation. Last time I was in there, I was one of 3 customers, I ordered a bagel and a coffee, and they forgot the coffee. There were 5 people working behind the counter. I am still scratching my head over that one. Several of the employees look like this is the last place they want to be, but some are very happy to give you that bagel. Wish they were all on the same page of happiness that I am in waiting for my bagel. Store set up: they really need to do something about traffic flow. Where you wait for your bagels to be done and the end of the line is all mashed together so no one knows whats going on. Its tough to see the menu and what kind of bagels they have until you are about on top of the register, so there is no prep time to make decisions. The coffee is hidden, so you have to know about it and know to order it before you get to the register. I understand that they have to work with the existing structure when they went in there, but I have to believe there is a better way. Oh, and if you want a larger take home side of cream cheese, yes they have that, way beyond the line, if its stocked. You really have to know its there to shop from there. Price: Bagel sandwich and a coffee will cost you almost $12. Yeah, I am not kidding. Its the priciest bagel place in town, even for city prices. So basically its a place to get great bagels, experience long waits in long lines, empty your pockets, and only for the regular if you want to be successful.

It turns out, this one is pretty good. They have some really interesting cream cheeses (the Tuscany is quite good) and some amazing sandwiches (Sweet Tooth has Almond butter, pomegranate jam on a French toast bagel). They have some really good coffee and Kombucha on tap. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is Service is not always the strongest.

I saw a long line and the tables full, always a good sign for any restaurant! To my surprise the line was moving along very fast. I ordered the loaded lox on a black Russian bagel. I am not sure why people are complaining about the prices, seems to be in line with every other bagel and sandwich shop I have been to.I took by bagel and OJ a few blocks down to the waterfront, took a bite and  OMG was it good! I tried lox bagels all over NYC and NJ and this spot was the best I had. The salmon was fresh and bagel was fresh and soft. The staff was very friendly also, I asked the girl at the register what was in the ""loaded lox"" and she took the time to explain to me and showed me it on the menu LCD that they have up by the registers. This is definitely my new bagel spot. My only regret is not taking a picture of the bagel before eating it to post it here.

101,EhUMOpLCtR-01XS1NsaVlw,James B.,1.0 star rating,"Overpriced trash that takes forever.  Whoever owns this place needs to make an unannounced visit and come check it out.  Literally the most piss poor operation in Hoboken at the moment.  Been here twice and it's been the same experience both times.  Reading other reviews it seems like that's just how it is here.  Staff is nice but completely incompetent.  Came here around 10 AM on a Monday Morning, already late for work, looking for a quick bite to eat.  There are 5 people behind the counter but it still took me literally 20 minutes to get a bacon egg and cheese and an iced coffee.  There wasn't a line or anything, but there were about 6-7 people all standing around waiting for their food while one of the staff is apparently on break eating his bagel in the cafe in front of everyone who is still waiting.  I get it dude, it's your break time, but maybe walk around the corner or eat in the back instead of chowing down in front of pissed off hungry customers.  Guy running the grill is taking his sweet ass time, totally clueless, asking his co workers which bagel was for who and what did they order over and over again as the tickets keep coming.  It took me 10 minutes to get an iced coffee...Management is totally clueless- manager is telling his guy to go refill the shelf with cokes at 10am on a Monday instead of help make bagels, fix the iced coffee machine, anything else to get rid of the line of people waiting for food.  Although might not have been the worst decision considering he already has 5 people working behind the counter and 3 of them are just standing around waiting to be told what to do.Might be worth it if the bagels were good, but they are pretty terrible.  Bagels are not chewy at all, overcooked, literally no taste...poorly cooked breakfast sandwich.  Remember we're in the bagel capital of the world...this shit wouldn't even be good in Alabama. Go literally anywhere else.  Here's a list- The place across from CVS/Starbucks is good (JP's Bagel Express?), Hoboken Hot Bagels on Washington between 6th-7th makes absolutely delicious bagels (but their breakfast sandwich isn't great).  Bagels on the Hudson is meh, but they are very quick and food is much better than here.Hey, this place looks nice though, and pretty good iced coffee even though it took 10 minutes to get it.This place is GARBAGE, not worth even half of the time it takes to eat here.  Also they don't have hot sauce (what the fuck???)",O’Bagel,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

I couldn't find a standard pork roll, egg & cheese bagel on a sign anywhere in the place, but Tuna & Sriracha, and other weird concoctions were readily available.- The bagels looked small, like Thomas's bagels sized small.- The radio in the place was as loud as a Saturday night at the Shannon. This leads me to believe ""when the big boss is away, the immature staff will play (the music as loud as they can).While I love JP's and Bagels on the Hudson, I'd even recommend going to Hoboken Hot Bagels as it's pretty much on the same block as this place.

It's not great enough to warrant crazy prices. It also has a horrible layout since it used to be a bar. The bagels are pretty good so it gets very crowded on the weekend, but there's no room to wait for your food. There's basically one aisle where they expect people to stand in line to order, wait for their food, and sit to eat at bar stools.

The bagels are consistently delicious - I would go as far as to say the best bagels I've ever had. They are large and always fresh, but it's important to note that with a large bagel, you're going to get more breadiness....that's kind of how it works. If you're not a fan of bready bagels, then you probably would prefer another place, honestly. If you like fresh bagels, a variety of options (from standard bagel with cream cheese to your choice of bagel sandwiches) then this is your spot.My reason for dropping down to 4 stars instead of 5 is unfortunately the service. When the owner is not there, it is slow and leaves a lot to be desired. Trust me, I don't mind the wait because of how much I love these bagels, but it's a little excessive. I waited 20 min, as the only person to have ordered, for 2 bagels with cream cheese. This isn't the norm - I've gone in and out in 5 min before, but I don't think it can be ignored.

They used all of the space for the server area and none for patrons.  They did not have half the items on there menu and were sold out of most bagels.  How are you not prepared and sell out of bagels? Also, no display at all, hard to even find the menu.  I had the lox sandwich on a Black Russian bagel which I do have to say was actually very good.  If the quality of food was not good this place would be a 1 star.  IF they figure out the kinks if the next few months I will return, otherwise I don't see them lasting due to the poor layout.

I ordered a sausage egg and cheese on a sesame bagel. The GF ordered some turkey healthy fitfam scooped bagel sandwich. Anyways after 30 minutes of standing in the blistering heat of this place other people started getting their orders to cure their hangovers as we stood unable to cure.  It took a few times to nudge them on the status of our order. I started overheating and the employees could most likely see my frustration in my eyes. After approx. 45 minutes they said they were just waiting on my sausage egg and cheese. It finally comes after I watched sportscenter two times through. Luckily my GF was able to calm my vulnerable soul on our 3 block walk back to my apartment.Upon entering the bag of food, my GF shrieked with anger as she yells that our order is not accurate and her healthy sandwich referred to above was not present, and that two sausage egg and cheeses were in the presence of our hungover bodies. We called and stated our issue and O'Bagel said they would make us what we were missing with a full refund.We trekked back through the heat of Hoboken to collect our now updated and hopefully accurate perishables to now cure our pain from Tally Ho the night prior. O'Bagel concocted our order and fully refunded the entirety of the order including the large cold brew ice coffee with a splash of 2% I guzzled down in the first 3 minutes as well as a Pinepple orange juice.Anywho, the bagel was OKAY. For the price of a sandwich you don't get as much bang for your buck at other Hoboken bagel places such as JP's Bagel which offers bagels that cure the hangover at hand as well as your next one in the future. Should be named NO'Bagel.",O’Bagel,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

Don't expect to order anything custom and have it come out like you wanted. I have gone  7 times now in the last 3 months and every time asked for the bacon well done and bagel toasted. Not once has the bagel been toasted or has the bacon even been close to being cooked, luke warm like the package just sat in the sun is a better description of the temperature of the bacon. I get it they are busy, but if i'm going to wait 15 min for my bacon, egg and cheese to cook; I would rather wait another 5 and actually have the bacon be cooked.",O’Bagel,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

148,-C70irjZcslEUcBfBhii3A,James T.,5.0 star rating,"I love this place but im posting more of a suggestion than a review because the bagels are fantastic and i think enough people have mentioned that already anyway.I  was born and raised and currently still live in NYC, AKA the bagel capitol of the world so i think anyone reading this can assume i know bagels.O bagels bakes the best iv ever eaten and im very happy to have found this place...unfortunately,  because of the outrageous rents now in both brooklyn and manhattan, bagels places are becoming rarer and rarer and the local bagel shop is almost extinct here in manhattan.Iv noticed online  that o bagels, before opening in hoboken had two other jersey locations and this new location in hoboken will be their third and if im not mistaken, their most urban and densely populated city and that is where my suggestion is based.It seems that their business plan and experience is based on the previous locations that i do not believe got even 25 percent the traffic the new hoboken location  generates and because of that, it seems tbey are currently ill equipped to handle the traffic.Since opening , the  first time we ate there, my girlfriend went to pick up our breakfast (she recently relocated to hoboken from here in nyc) and she waited on line for an hour!!!  A week later i went to get our breakfaat, this time much later hoping to avoid the long wait but to no avail, i too waited nearly  an hour for two bagels and coffee...the third weekend, despite o bagles being our first choice, we decided the hour wait just wasnt worth it and went to hoboken bagels instead.Heres my suggestion,  get a clue guys!!!you are no longer in the sticks of jersey,  you are in a major city with a very dense population and you need to both structure your customer flow and train your staff accordingly because no matter how good you think you are doing, you are losing a TON of business..the few times i decided to wait on line i literally watched half your potential customers walk away..What busy nyc bagel shops do is have two lines, the first line is simply to place your order, you then go on a second line and while you are waiting to pay, your food is getting prepared and it's ready when its your turn to pay...you will serve twice as many people this way and your customers will not waste half their morning trying to buy a bagel. ..this is my suggestion...also you need to have either more or faster employees preparing the bagels because i watched how long it took for a bagel and creemcheese to be ready after a customer paid and it was way way way too long...your employees need to move their buts a lot faster and act a little more energized and alive   because they all seemed like they were stoned....no matter how good your bagels are ( and they are fantastic) no bagel is worth wasting your entire weekend morning for....maybe your customers are willing to do this to try a new place but very quickly i grew tired of waiting and went elsewhere  and im certain many others will do the same..  Congrats on the new location and great work producing a great product that people seem to love, if you sort out your service problem you will have a home run! !!!",O’Bagel,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

One guy in front of me didn't get his sandwiches, cause they lost his ticket, so he just asked for a refund, cause he waited for a long time already... The layout is very unclear: a lot of people waiting upfront, which makes it very confusing when you enter the place. The menu is also not readable: you have to unfold the page to see all the items. Very unpleasant experience... Probably would give 2 stars, but since this place is new, I don't want to be too harsh on them. They definitely have to rethink their organization, cause if they handled 3 customers so long, how long will it take for 10 people... Seemed to be unfair for the guy on a grill, he was running like a chicken, and other guys just chitchatted by the register.
