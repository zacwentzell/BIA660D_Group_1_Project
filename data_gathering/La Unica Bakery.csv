I'm not even sure where to start, but here goes:1) The cafe incorporates both Spanish and Asian influences, so they offer a pretty diverse menu of foods and drinks. They have pastries, breads, sandwiches, quick bites, coffee/espresso/tea, juices, etc. (Rumor has it bubble tea will be making its premiere in the summer.) Some personal favorites are the sponge cake, guava pastries, Cuban sandwich, cortadito, and juices. Definitely quality products at a good price.2) It's quite spacious with a lot of seating and lighting (both overhead and natural). The long wooden bench is surprisingly comfortable. And the music is usually pretty good -- like familiar pop hits at a soft volume. And they have WiFi, too. I also like that they're open later than most cafes (usually till 7pm) because my caffeine and baked goods needs do not end at 5pm lol3) The staff are very friendly! The owners always make sure to say hi and greet the customers. The women behind the counter are very nice and attentive. 4) The location is pretty good because it's close to public transportation (bus and light rail). And since it's on Central Ave., it's usually an easy stop for when I'm running errands or commuting through the area.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
1,BZM9xRzl77gBwyP8QBuXlw,Leny H.,5.0 star rating,"La Unica Bakery is a fantastic addition to the Heights neighborhood. The owners really care about making this bakery a space for people to feel welcomed, and it shows. From its spacious interior, free WiFi, delicious treats, and awesome coffee, there's no reason not to hang out here for a few. Bring a book, bring your laptop, bring your Switch. Their cafe con leche is awesome but my favorite is their ginger tea. The Cuban sandwich, empanadas, and coconut custard are all delicious. They also have a section with different flavored breads. The best one I tried was the one with custard but they're all pretty good. I can't say enough about the staff. They're all very friendly and attentive. I'm happy we have a plaxLa Unica Bakery close by. I might go there right now.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
2,Xo6QEQhhhIIHIreWmN2ukA,Patty G.,5.0 star rating,"I know what you are thinking.. great, another bakery on Central Ave but do yourself a favor and come by. La Unica is different than most bakeries that are on Central Ave. The decor and space is beautiful and there is plenty of seating and open space too. They have complimentary wifi which makes it a great space to come work. The staff here is so pleasant and great. They are truly welcoming and if you're here long enough you might even get a free sample of something sweet. They offer a great amount of sweets and what I like about it is that they are not overly sweet. They also offer sandwiches, salads, fresh juices, shakes, and smoothies. Their prices are also really reasonable.I really like their coconut pie and always order one. Ive tired a decent amount of their sweets and empanadas all so good. The owners are personable and really want to offer good food to the community. This is definitely one of my favorite spots to come in and get some work done and just get out of the apartment.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
3,-iBrGGnuJ1MUgYML4DDUkQ,Rob W.,3.0 star rating,"La Unica is a nice addition to Central Avenue in The Heights, but they have a little bit of work to do. First, the atmosphere is open, airy, bright, and warm. They offer free WiFi, so it's a great spot to catch up on your email over a coffee and bite to eat. The staff is attentive and welcoming, so A+ there. Onto the food: The Cuban Pressed Sandwich- good size, excellent taste. The Ham & Cheese Pressed Sandwich- tasty, good amount of meat and Cheese. The Coffee- Fresh, tasty. For a bakery, I expected to see a wide variety of baked goods, but they were really lacking in this department. When I went in (a few weeks after opening) they didn't have much and what they did have didn't seem all that fresh. I ate some of the free samples and they didn't convince me to buy more. Overall, I am happy to have another good spot in the Heights to have a coffee and baked good. I will update this review after my next visit!",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
4,c7e2rtfZ2ReEphxGPAMh8g,Cara Z.,5.0 star rating,"Excellent customer service!  The one girl that works here is especially attentive and friendly.  She goes above and beyond.   I had ordered an almond latte but it tasted like cigarettes.   (I now believe almond milk is just not good for hot lattes... the flavor and texture mutates. It's just not good).   Anyway, I told her and she had an idea to make it with soy milk and it tastes wonderful.   Creamy, slightly sweet.  Warm perfection.  Papa Rellena was good too.  Nice crispy texture on the outside.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
5,dugA_rKOfCPu4Wdj5Rtt7g,Ashleigh O.,4.0 star rating,"I came here today for my regular caffeine fix instead of Dulce De Leche. Lovely space: clean, modern, comfortable. The staff is very kind and accommodating. The manager was around when I came by and he went out of his way to guarantee I was satisfied. Yes, granted, it's easier to be hands on when there aren't any other customers but solid business acumen can be lost on you regardless. My latte was made perfectly. The beans they use are fresh and robust. I got mine with almond milk but they also offer soy as well as the regular cow varieties. I don't know if this place will survive without more customers and customers that continuously come back by extension. I have no doubt in my mind they're just as good as any other bakery in the area - maybe better - but thriving always comes down to more than that. Come here and check 'em out. You won't regret it.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"

9,u76vlZnLB1I_dyw8qK-7iA,Francis S.,5.0 star rating,"I've been here several times since it opened recently, and this bakery is great! They did a beautiful job renovating the storefront. You'll be quite comfortable at their nice tables as you eat. There's also strong wifi if you want to get some work done.I had a very good latte and also a big slice of chocolate cake. The cake was quite moist and flavorful. They garnished it by hand in an attractive pattern with chocolate syrup instead of just taking it out of the case and giving it to me, which was going above and beyond. The young lady working the counter is very polite and welcoming. She produces a nice atmosphere in the bakery. Also, the prices are very good. You get quite a bit for your money.Stop in some time!",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
10,Pr7eBDc7y6rqfQJNwipJ7g,Maridalia H.,1.0 star rating,If I could give zero stars I would. I just went to buy a sandwich for dinner since I heard the food is good and I always eat at the same restaurants by me on central so wanted to try something new. The website says they close at 8. I walked in at 6:35 and the girl said she couldn't make me the sandwich because she had already turned off the grill for the night. Then she sarcastically yelled good night!!! My interest of trying their food completely faded with her attitude.,La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"

It is very nice to see a nice dining option on Central Ave. I think they did a nice job with the place and remodeling. The have a great selection of baked good. Today, I had the Green Tea Roll. It was excellent! The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions too. My one suggestion would be some more healthy lunch options. While empanadas, cubans, etc are great, I cannot eat them everyday.",La Unica Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Cafes,, Desserts"
