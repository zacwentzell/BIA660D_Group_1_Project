But I don't quite follow how when something is the best how it doesn't meet your ""requirements"". At the very least wouldn't you try and maintain the same quality with your new supplier, rather than drop 50% in quality? As far as the soy sauce goes, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that that is one of the main flavors when eating sushi. So to 'skimp' on that And resort to store bought product, when so many top of the line places are brewing their own these days, simply because you want to print an ingredient label, seems a bit shortsighted.  Why not just print the ingredients on your own soy? If nothing else, don't you want your fish to be the best tasting it can be?

We came on a Wednesday night for dinner, there was no wait and we were seated in the back along the windows which was awesome because you get views of the Hudson, the boats and the sunset reflected off the freedom tower.  You get edamame for the table, just a small plate but it's a great start. I also ordered the miso soup to start and it was fantastic. It came out hot and was very flavorful! For my entree I got 3 sushi rolls, the tuna, salmon, and shrimp. They were all very good, nothing too special about them but they tasted fresh and the 3 rolls are very filling. My boyfriend got one of their noodle soup dishes with chicken, vegetables, and shrimp tempura. It was very flavorful and good as well! Service was good as well, our waters were constantly filled, only thing is near the end out waitress seemed to have been a bit distracted by other tables so we had to flag her down to get her attention. Also, our entrees were brought out at different times, which was odd because one person could start eating while the other was just sitting there waiting for the food.

6,Ok1dQhsagG4woh9dhHSiCg,Amit J.,4.0 star rating,"Visited Komegashi Too for the first time after a night out catching up with some best friends at Taphaus near Harberside in Jersey City. We were hungry afterwards and decided to take the short walk here for dinner. Although I've passed this area on multiple occasions and visited restaurants nearby, I never noticed Komegashi but glad we did this time because we had such a wonderful experience here. - Food: Asian and Japanese Cuisine has always been hit or miss for me at restaurants, but the food here was absolutely well made and delicious. They also had a wide variety of options, including some for vegetarians. We shared appetizers including the Jumbo Crab Cakes which came topped with a Sweet Salsa and complimented them well. I also ordered the Vegetable Gyoza (Pan Fried Vegetable Gyoza Dumplings) ($5.95) as an appetizer. It was absolutely delicious and came with a Spicy Mayo on the side which went well with the dumplings. We also ordered a bottle of Merlot Red Wine ($20), which was ok but very reasonable. For the main entree, I ordered the Teryiaki Salmon (Teryiaki Salmon Fillets, Broccoli and Vegetables, Steamed White Rice) ($18.50). This was also really delicious too, and was a hearty meal -- I got two well sized Salmon Fillets which was more than enough to fill me up and I took the other fillet home.  Very tasty, well seasoned and really delicious. I'll probably get the same dish when I visit again!- Service and Atmosphere: Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the questions we had about the menu. She stopped by a couple times to check on us and we had a few short friendly conversations. The atmosphere is more casual than high end, and a bit dark but we really enjoyed it. We were able to have great conversations and didn't have to worry about maintaining a certain noise level, it also was fairly quiet and allowed guests to have intimate conversations. Towards the back, you also get a view of the marina and boats by the water. Parking: Parking around Komegashi Too and this area might be a bit tough to find, so if you're looking for convenience it might be better to park in the lot across the street or the many lots in the surrounding area such as the Newport Mall North Parking Garage. Sometimes I get lucky with street parking a block away by the hotel or by Harberside which is a couple blocks away. Alternatively, the PATH station is right across the street as well. Overall, this is really a nice hidden gem in the Newport area of Jersey City. Really delicious food and service at a reasonable price, especially for the neighborhood.

I had teriyaki chicken (yakitori) which was good quality meat and tasted delicious. The pork gyoza is very similar to Chinese pot stickers but are fried. Personally, I don't care for the fried aspect of it, but I did enjoy it. Because I'm a weirdo, I ordered a side of mashed potatoes. I had no idea if mashed potatoes would taste good at a Japanese restaurant because that is kind of a strange menu item, but they were absolutely delicious. Very buttery and smooth! The banana foster dessert was so tasty and reasonably priced! Our waitress was very nice and personable. The Bad: There was only one waitress and she was also the bartender. When we came in she was serving about 20 people. So service was slow. She was trying really hard and was always busy, so it wasn't her fault for the slow service. What ticked me off though, was that they had not 1, but 2 HOSTESSES, just sitting there doing nothing!!!! You can't help the waitress out??? What a waste. They need to get their service priorities straight. Even if there was just one hostess she should have helped the waitress.

The oysters were spectacular !   Large juicy Maine oysters, I was told they just arrived today and so likely was just caught yesterday.   They definitely tasted that fresh.   I like that there is a soy chilli sauce to put on the oysters on top of wedges of lemon.  Different, but good different.Deep fried soft Shell Crab rolls.  Perfectly seasoned to the point that I don't really need to dip in soy sauce.   I love soft-shell crab so I'm easy to please here.Got some pieces of Nigiri sushi al la carte.   Chu-Toro (medium fatty toro) was delicious, and well...raw scallop sushi was melt in my mouth.    The uni was super fresh and rich, the white tuna (butterfish) was nice but my favourite was the Hamachi Belly.   Oh my goodness.....if you haven't had it, just get it.  The fatty belly texture is out of this world!    Seared duck breast - cooked - on a bed of corn was amazingly flavourful and tender.  I even enjoyed the corn a lot.  We polished off this dish. Tempura shrimp - Super crispy, hot and fresh....can't complain here.....just a classic.Lastly....for dessert, I had a slice of their Matcha Mille Crepe from Lady M .   The lightest most amazing crepe cake I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I wasn't expecting it to be this light and delicate.  I was in heaven.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again....the views alone make a trek to this restaurant worthwhile, while the food....just speaks for itself!",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

It is right near the entrance to the path train at Newport, so it has some nice views of the river from certain tables. Everything is very fresh and I have never had a bad experience with the seafood. They also have a good variety of specialty rolls which change seasonally.I will say that it is fairly expensive compared to other sushi places I have been, and I would not be able to afford to feast there as much as I do when I am there for work purposes. I can eat 2 rolls on my own, and that would probably end up being about $30 before you consider drinks, tax, and tip.It can get fairly loud inside the restaurant with groups from various offices nearby, and also some families with small children, so be aware of that. Maybe not the best spot for a date night during the week. I also tried a few desserts including the green tea crepe cake, which was very unique. It had about 20 layers of crepes with mousse in between each layer.

When we were seated we were given two little bowls of edamame to share among 8 people. I didn't think it was enough and when we asked for more the waitress told us we would need to pay for it. We said no and ordered 3 appetizers of the fried oysters which were delicious. For main course I ordered the sashimi platter which was good and large in amount. I can say that I was full but the plate was rather expensive and I had a bone in one of my fish. Iv had better sashimi platters. The waitress also forgot our two bowls of rice. I've definitely had better quality but I must say the amount was a lot. For dessert my aunt had recommended the fried ice cream and that was a winner.  I ordered the vanilla because it's my favorite and I'm not too big into green tea.

It's even more incredible since I've never eaten at Komegashi for dinner or ordered dessert there. With your talent for lying, maybe you should write fiction instead?  Anyway, it's too bad that Komegashi has such unscrupulous management, because the food was rather decent. You've earned your one star many times over at this point.P.S. I don't drink, so...nice try? Just FYI.Edit: Wait, so let me get this straight: you didn't make up the incident, but you assumed that I was someone else WITHOUT DOUBLE-CHECKING in order to discredit my review. I dunno, kinda sounds like textbook awful management to me. Even without my review, there are plenty of other Yelpers who had similar bad experiences at Komegashi and mentioned it. I don't go out of my way to bash restaurants, either. Anyone looking through Yelp can read and judge for themselves. In the end, you're not concerned with the fact that you treated someone terribly.

I had teriyaki chicken (yakitori) which was good quality meat and tasted delicious. The pork gyoza is very similar to Chinese pot stickers but are fried. Personally, I don't care for the fried aspect of it, but I did enjoy it. Because I'm a weirdo, I ordered a side of mashed potatoes. I had no idea if mashed potatoes would taste good at a Japanese restaurant because that is kind of a strange menu item, but they were absolutely delicious. Very buttery and smooth! The banana foster dessert was so tasty and reasonably priced! Our waitress was very nice and personable. The Bad: There was only one waitress and she was also the bartender. When we came in she was serving about 20 people. So service was slow. She was trying really hard and was always busy, so it wasn't her fault for the slow service. What ticked me off though, was that they had not 1, but 2 HOSTESSES, just sitting there doing nothing!!!! You can't help the waitress out??? What a waste. They need to get their service priorities straight. Even if there was just one hostess she should have helped the waitress.

The oysters were spectacular !   Large juicy Maine oysters, I was told they just arrived today and so likely was just caught yesterday.   They definitely tasted that fresh.   I like that there is a soy chilli sauce to put on the oysters on top of wedges of lemon.  Different, but good different.Deep fried soft Shell Crab rolls.  Perfectly seasoned to the point that I don't really need to dip in soy sauce.   I love soft-shell crab so I'm easy to please here.Got some pieces of Nigiri sushi al la carte.   Chu-Toro (medium fatty toro) was delicious, and well...raw scallop sushi was melt in my mouth.    The uni was super fresh and rich, the white tuna (butterfish) was nice but my favourite was the Hamachi Belly.   Oh my goodness.....if you haven't had it, just get it.  The fatty belly texture is out of this world!    Seared duck breast - cooked - on a bed of corn was amazingly flavourful and tender.  I even enjoyed the corn a lot.  We polished off this dish. Tempura shrimp - Super crispy, hot and fresh....can't complain here.....just a classic.Lastly....for dessert, I had a slice of their Matcha Mille Crepe from Lady M .   The lightest most amazing crepe cake I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I wasn't expecting it to be this light and delicate.  I was in heaven.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again....the views alone make a trek to this restaurant worthwhile, while the food....just speaks for itself!",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

It is right near the entrance to the path train at Newport, so it has some nice views of the river from certain tables. Everything is very fresh and I have never had a bad experience with the seafood. They also have a good variety of specialty rolls which change seasonally.I will say that it is fairly expensive compared to other sushi places I have been, and I would not be able to afford to feast there as much as I do when I am there for work purposes. I can eat 2 rolls on my own, and that would probably end up being about $30 before you consider drinks, tax, and tip.It can get fairly loud inside the restaurant with groups from various offices nearby, and also some families with small children, so be aware of that. Maybe not the best spot for a date night during the week. I also tried a few desserts including the green tea crepe cake, which was very unique. It had about 20 layers of crepes with mousse in between each layer.

When we were seated we were given two little bowls of edamame to share among 8 people. I didn't think it was enough and when we asked for more the waitress told us we would need to pay for it. We said no and ordered 3 appetizers of the fried oysters which were delicious. For main course I ordered the sashimi platter which was good and large in amount. I can say that I was full but the plate was rather expensive and I had a bone in one of my fish. Iv had better sashimi platters. The waitress also forgot our two bowls of rice. I've definitely had better quality but I must say the amount was a lot.

Yes, it's overpriced - and it continues to raise prices to ridiculous levels. No, your udon bowls should not cost $17-$18. And, given how little unagi you have in your unagi don, how do you get away with charging $25 for it? And, don't get me started on your excuse for Asian stir fry that you call Tokyo Fusion and again charge $16+. Seriously, this is Jersey City, not TriBeCa.

We waited a more than adequate time to be attended by our server, give our drink orders, receive our drinks and then our entrees. The place wasn't that busy, yes it was during lunch but it was towards the end of the lunch rush. The food was good I would have to say but I wasn't superbly impressed and have had better at half the cost. My nephew being a baby broke the styrofoam cup of water given which the server cleaned up and never gave a replacement.The kicker of the whole experience was when leaving. My sister-in-law having just payed the bill, was asked by the hostess walking around the establishment why she was not leaving a tip which, she and I agreed the service given or lack there of didn't deem a tip, and my sister-in-law expressed those feelings to the hostess. The hostess then goes on to say something in reference to the meal not being expensive enough for such attention.

And they all came out within 20 minutes of each other.  The waitress didn't even ask if we wanted to space it out, the food literally just kept coming and each time, she pushed the plates around to make room for more.  We finally started stacking plates to make it obvious it was too crowded.Ok, the food.  Because I can forgive this kind of odd service if the food is amazing.  But it's just scraping by as average!!!  First, lobster spring roll ($6.00).  Literally 80% lettuce, 15% rice paper and 5% lobster.  Just no.Cucumber salad was the best thing I had here all night.  Sliced cucumbers marinated in a creamy ginger dressing with fluffy seaweed next to it with the perfect amount of bite and slightly salty flavor.  This was delicious and I would eat again.Next, pan seared scallop appetizer ($13.00).  Total bomb.  Scallops were pan seared about oh, maybe a few hours ago.  No crisp crust, instead mealy and soggy.  They were sitting on a bed of bunapi mushrooms and 4 snap pea pods in a porcini gravy sauce.  We didn't eat it and the waitress just scooped it up not even asking about it.  Next up, miso black cod.  A favorite dish of mine because it's normally a nice contrast to raw fish.  This one was served with a garlic butter sauce, I don't know why.  Very thinly sliced rather than the nice thick chunks I am accustomed to being served.  Had very little flavor and the quality was just average.  I have a feeling all of this was steam tabled and plated to order, as nothing was piping hot or crusted.And the sushi.  Had a mini Godzilla roll which is what I was hoping to be the best as it is a signature item.  The eel was bony and I was turned off.  The texture of the fried and battered seaweed was good but unfortunately, inedible. Too much going on in one roll without any cohesion.  Ordered the Maine uni.  Devoid of any color and flavor.  Disappointing.  The sushi roll we had was mostly rice and subpar.  Only one small piece of ok quality salmon was on top.Not coming back.The whole dinner plus tip was $115.00.  I so wanted to like this place, as it's been in JC for 17 years.  So far my fave Japanese restaurant is Honshu in JC and I would recommend heading there for comparable priced yet much better quality dishes and service.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Ordered their Lychee martini (which was fab) and a glass of their house cab (which was interestingly good too). So four star for the drinks and value for money.Happy hour prices for food menu were a joke for example their spicy tuna roll is $6.25 on the regular menu and it was $6 for happy hour - 25cents discount, seriously?Ordered a few oysters (they were just ok) and a few rolls and fried veg dumplings (which was really good).

I immediately was turned off the second I walked in the door. Very dark, gloomy looking, not much of a romantic atmosphere, the host didn't greet or say HI. i went to the Yelp area and they gave us tasty beer. I looked at the food they were giving, I knew the thick sticky long noodles weren't my thing in the past, so I asked to ONLY get veggies with sauce and their tasty chicken (that's why there was a one star).I wasn't pleased with the way the manager and staff handled our YELP event. I walked in and spoke with our Yelp event coordinator a little bit and then went to find seating. Although it didn't look like there was seating left. I did see someone had left a table, but there was money and dishes on the table, so I asked if we could sit there. The manager was VERY rude, very disrespectful to me, and said ""you are only limited in seating for your event"", but when I looked around there wasn't any room to stand either. I'm just not quite sure why we choose this spot. I believe, I then realized why most of the folks STAYED at Dorrian's (they skipped this sushi spot - they knew about this place and their food, and their service so they stayed), that's an assumption, but I'm really disappointed in everything at this spot. The staff wasn't friendly, and they didn't even have tip jars out so we could tip or even be thankful that they opened their restaurant up for us. It was nice of them to do it, but honestly I would've rather went some place else in the rain then be in that cold vibe of a restaurant. I hate bad talking, but my experience here wasn't very good, welcoming, and maybe my hair was too big for this location, but it gets better. Because I thought she was soo nice I forgot to get my car validations and she said oh well we don't do that for you, ONLY our customers. So clearly she was rude again about the whole thing. It seemed as if she was SOOO annoyed of me even thinking to come back and ask. My friend told her it was on the email so that's why we parked there, and then she told us the coordinator said to send an email if you have any troubles and YELP will reimbursed you, but we ended up having no issues so we wasted out breath for nothing here. Overall I will never ever return, even if someone has a birthday here. I just don't like rude unwelcoming places. I will not be back...I didn't have their sushi, but there are a million sushi spots I can go to especially in NYC.

I don't know what they're going for as far as ambiance but it's off.  The whole vibe was dark and gloomy with weird wall art of live singing performances on top of traditional Japanese styling. Nothing worked.  We were seated in a sitting area that's so dark we can barely read the menu.  Seriously.  We had to wait for our eyes to adjust.  I almost used my cellphone light.Our party of four ordered sashimi, sushi, and a beef teriyaki dishes.  The beef dish came out at least 5 minutes before the rest of the groups meals.  When the sushi/sashimi finally arrived there was no rice.  They said they'd give us rice, and they did, but not before we had eaten our meals.  I would have liked to have rice with my sashimi but oh well.  Finally, my rice was taken away by the bus boy before I was done eating and without being asked.  On that note, service was terrible.  It was slow, inattentive, and almost not there at all. This is a lunch spot around a lot of office buildings.  People cannot be expected to come here during lunch on their break if service is moving at this pace.  Bottom line is I'm not going back here.  They could possibly add a couple stars by buying lights, improving the timing of their food delivery, and hiring a more experienced wait staff.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

I will go ahead and put it out there, but this is the best sushi restaurant I have been to since I have moved to the East Coast. We stumbled across this place on accident after a day of wandering around aimlessly at Newport Mall. Steps away from the mall, next to the PATH station and on the shores of Hudson River location is not only prime but it is absolutely beautiful. Upon entering the restaurant you are put under the false illusion of a cramped restaurant with a large bar and smaller table settings, but as soon as you turn the corner BOOM you come face to face with a huge dining area with a gorgeous view of the Hudson. The interior of the restaurant is modernly decorated, with a long mirror against the wall, various works of art lining the wall and dim lowly hung lamps. As soon as we sat down our waiter handed us warm lightly scented hand towels in preparation of our meal. Soon after we were given a small dish of complementary edamame. I ordered a seaweed salad and the Smoky Tiger Roll; the boyfriend got the Sake Ikura Don bowl (it included miso soup). Considering how busy the restaurant was our food came out pretty quickly. It was all so beautifully displayed. The Smoky Tiger roll had avocado, smoked salmon, eel, tobiko and topped off with eel sauce. Aside from it being a bit too salty it was absolutely delicious. The hero of the meal was the Sake Ikura Don bowl, just wow - sushi rice topped with salmon sashimi, seared salmon and ikura (salmon roe). Each sashimi slice was thick, had an adequate amount of fish fat and tasted very fresh. The seared salmon wasn't overdone, just a bit on top to bring out the fatty flavors of the salmon. The ikura was tasty and fresh. We topped off our meal with dessert. I had my favorite, the tempura green tea ice cream. For those who have never tried it is a MUST. A ball of green tea ice cream (they also have vanilla) wrapped with shortcake and flash fried in tempura. It is about the size of a baseball, sliced in half and topped with whip cream. The ice cream was soft and smooth, paired with the spongy shortcake and crisp tempura batter paired beautifully. My boyfriend ordered the gluten free brownie dish that came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a banana with brown sugar atop. I was too absorbed in my dessert to bother tasting his but it looked delicious. Prices here are very reasonable ranging between $11-$15 per entree. I also noticed that they have great lunch options, I will be back. So many other things I must try.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

82,x_3XtdDb9ulZFLC5RgmFYQ,Chavon W.,1.0 star rating,"I have been to this restaurant too many times to count. Usually, I sit in the bar area, and am there 1-2x per week for happy hour. The bartender who wears glasses, has tattoos, and red hair (I believe) is AMAZING. If she is working, you are sure to get good service, even if the food is a bit slow. I've had impromptu gatherings, with cake, and candles, and this bartender has always been helpful and gracious, and tipped well for her excellent service.HOWEVER, several times, I have come and had a blonde woman as a server with the most horrendous attitude and ""service"" , if you can even call it that. Several times, we have just ignored the poor service from her. Usually we just come and hope the other bartender is arounds.  Yet, the last two times dealing with her and the management have caused me never to return.The first time, while in the midst of serving my party of 2, she disappeared behind the hostess desk to sit and read a magazine. HELLO! I can see you. I had to chase her down just to get a glass of water or ask for the check. Of course, I did not tip her for that complete lack of service. As I am leaving, a woman stopped us to ask if something was wrong. At that time, we explained how disappointed in the poor service we were, to which she said she understood...WELLLLLL, this last time I dealt with her, we sat at the bar. My friend went inside first, ordered a drink and appetizer from the bartender (blonde girl), and then NOTHING. I walk in, sit down, and an older asian woman comes over and asks ""what do you want?"" We mentioned that we had not received what was already ordered, and could we see a menu. My friend reiterates what she had already ordered, and the asian woman stormed off. The entire time, the bartender is serving the young ladies next to us and refuses to look in our direction. A few minutes later the Asian woman comes back with the red wine, in a glass that looks like it had been on the shelf since 1908, and with the rim of dust still on it to match... And, it wasn't even a proper glass for red wine. When we brought it to her attention, she took it, stormed off, and proceeded to show it to the bartender. At this point, we clearly are not going to get good service and decide to leave. As we are leaving, we are trying to get our validated parking ticket, and the hostess says she has to check if we can have it and walks away. I ask the other hostess for a manager. Would you believe the person whom she brings as the manager is the old, asian lady who had been ""serving us""?!? She then proceeds to mention that the last encounter we had with that bartender, we did not tip her, and thus, she is refusing to serve us. In what world is it ok for a server not to serve and for a manager to allow such subpar service and behavior? In what world does a manager not then try to overcompensate  for the poor service and give exceptional service??? Then, the manager gives us major attitude and excuses and says that she didn't pour that dirty, incorrect wine, but the bartender did it. So, you let her give us wine in a filthy glass? As the manager, are you unfamiliar with the correct stemware to use for which wine type??? During this entire conversation, the bartender has left her post at the bar and her customers in order to stand behind the hostess desk to smirk during the entire exchange with the manager.I have never had such a poor interaction with a manager. Where do they find these people???The funny part is a large part of my professional work is to scout venues for events I plan, so I am always out at different restaurants, bars, clubs, etc... I would NEVER recommend this place  to my worst enemy.Needless to say, we left that Friday night and headed up the road to Las Olas in Hoboken where we had the friendliest, funniest server and the best drinks... So, at least my night was salvaged no thanks to Komegashi. lasolasushi.com if you need a referral...No worries.

Their Sumi roll is tasty but not my favorite. With regards to service, I do think that its faster service when you sit at the bar tables instead of the space in the back, at least in my experience.Overall, its a nice spot to come after a long week and unwind with some good happy hour deals and views of the city.

I've since moved back to the area and thought I'd try them again.  It took an 1 hour 45 mins to receive my delivery, on a clear night (nothing to stop the delivery guy from reaching my apartment which is a 10 min walk).  Several of my neighbors stopped ordering from there because of the terrible delivery times and they are rude and unapologetic and give no compensation for their bad service.  DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

The sashimi on top was cut into irregular pieces - some of them too thick, and some were too long like torn instead of cut, which makes you feel they're made of those parts that left over after making other sashimi dishes. Uni was stale.Entree is normally served with udon/sushi/soba/miso soup, and edamame. Don't know if it's their way to make you feel it's worth that 25 bucks. But it's not.

I HATE sushi and when I say hate, I mean the last time I had it, I spit it out in a napkin (tmi, I know, but need to make that clear ;) ).

The Spicy White Lover Roll did not taste anything special to me and I got it due to my love for salmon.  I was able to take a bit of my friend's roll the Sumi Roll: (Yellowtail, avocado, scallions, mango,and chili inside with spicy tuna and a piece of jalapeno on the outisde) which I tasted better and would get again if I came back here.Service was very attentive here and overall I had a nice experience here.  Oh, and even though parking on the street is tough here, you can always park in the garage nearby and they can validate your parking pass for free parking.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

First they give you complimentary edamame to snack on while you are ordering which is unheard of nowadays. And their house salad with ginger dressing was actually a salad...with vegetables! Not just a bowl of iceberg lettuce and a glob of ginger dressing which is what you usually get elsewhere. So that made me happy right off the bat. When our sushi came, it was amazing. Both rolls were extremely fresh tuna and Salmon. And to end a great meal I couldn't decide to go with vanilla or try green tea ice dream for dessert so the waitress brought me a small scoop of both!

Our server was on top of his game with water, recommendations, suggestions and overall great service. We ordered a large edamame. They came out piping hot. Solid. Where things got a little discouraging was the roll we ordered: the salmon naruto roll. It's not on the menu but the waiter offered it up when we asked for a roll with out rice. The roll came out, and I have had this roll before. Usually it's so awkwardly large you can't eat it. This $12 roll, was teeny. Five small little sections with barely any fish and avocado with a thin slice of cucumber. I would have been ok if this was $6-$7 but really $12? Definitely a rip off.I ordered the Tokyo fusion dish with steak and my man went with the sashimi special. The fish that came out on his dish was fresh and a great variety but again it was on the pricy side for the amount (we just ate at Honshu and though 2 of the fish varieties weren't as delicious, there was a hell of a lot more fish involved). My Tokyo fusion was delicious, with great spice, though I needed more and the steak was thick cuts that were delicious. However there was a whole lot of rice and very few pieces of steak and veggies for the $18 price tag. Do we see an overall theme here?Don't get the side grilled vegetables. $5 for about 6 slices of vegetables.Overall, the food is good here and if price really doesn't matter then I think you can get a great and enjoyable meal here for the location and the view.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Ours was right next to the bar area and we couldn't hear each other. We ordered the amore and the Alaskan rolls. Both good. Wat was different and wat we really enjoyed was the chicken mikado entree. It's a breaded chicken cutlet on a curry sauce with grilled veggies n rice. Really yum and good sized. We also got a bottle of warm sake which we shared. Our server helped us select this. Prices are a little on the higher side but if you eat in NYC it's normal.,Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

The bar and seating area are very well decorated. It is great when sitting at a table to enjoy the view of the water and nearby marina. The service is usually pretty quick, and the food is just about average. I usually spring for basic Chicken Teriyaki or Tempura.What really keeps me from coming here more often are the outrageous prices. Most entrees are between $16-$20 with sushi rolls starting at $5. To top it off, the majority of entrees do not come with a soup or salad, just a side of rice.

The way the flavors worked together with the crispy wonton shells, perfectly seared tuna and mixed greens, it was so delicious.  The salmon cannon was equally great.  The flavor combination was perfect.  We both had sushi for our entree and ended up getting pretty much the same rolls.  Our only complaint was that the Philly Roll was too salty for our liking and I wasn't crazy about the way they do the spicy salmon roll, which was basically a salmon roll with spicy mayo on top.  It wasn't listed on the menu, so I'm assuming they don't serve this roll that much.  In spite of that, we had a lovely dinner as always.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Pavonia Newport is an up and coming area and there just aren't enough places to eat.This place has all the usual food that are served in any Japanese restaurant. I usually get the udon noodles, shrimp tempura and the california roll. I have brought friends here whenever we were in Jersey City and they all loved it. Also, my coworkers and i would always come in and splurge whenever we had a bad day in the office, needed to get away and BS about someone in the cubicle next to us that we hated, or whenever we got a bad bonus in January (which was every January). This place also has a delicious dessert dish that i love, but i cannot remember the name, but it includes ice cream. The only thing is, Japanese food is SUPER expensive. They have the formula down pat. Japanese food like sushi isn't even cooked yet it is more expensive than any other restaurant (Chinese, American Diner, Italian). The thing is, the stores in the area are a monopoly and because of this, they are able to charge whatever they want since there aren't many options in the area. So its pretty much: Eat, pay up or get lost because there is nothing else in the area. But DAMN the prices can be a bit steep at times. It can benefit from a small discount.

170,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,4.0 star rating,"Really 4.5 (dammit Yelp, give us half-star measurements!).After a long and strenuous evening of Christmas shopping at the Newport Mall on Friday (12/13), my boyfriend and I decided on sushi and came across this place. Although we didn't have reservations, we were seated quickly, and I was surprised at how expansive the restaurant is: it looked like a standard sushi bar but opened up into an attractive dining area once you walked past the bar. Our hostess was also kind enough to seat us right next to the window overlooking the river. Our waiter was prompt and efficient, although he took some time picking up our check. Since we were starving, we both ordered separate appetizers (I asked for the Sakura yellowtail, my boyfriend ordered popcorn shrimp). The yellowtail was thinly sliced and came topped with jalapeño peppers in a lemongrass sauce. It was delicious. I also ""helped"" my boyfriend finish his shrimp, which were seasoned and battered perfectly and came with two sauces: one was a spicy mayo and the other tasted like a pimiento sauce. For our main dishes, I ordered an eel and avocado roll and the Spicy Tiger Roll (this came with crab, tuna, eel and tobiko, topped with eel and smoked salmon). My boyfriend ordered yellowtail sashimi and the Sweet and Spicy Roll (this was apparently voted Roll of 2012). I loved my meal, my boyfriend, not so much. I sampled his yellowtail, which was delicious, but the Sweet and Spicy Roll left a little to be desired. It was stuffed with too many jalapeño peppers, and the heat from them overpowered the sweetness of the fish inside (I think it was yellowtail, but I'm not sure). We split a bottle of warm sake and also enjoyed chilled edamame (complimentary, according to our waiter). For dessert, we shared the flourless chocolate cake, which came with vanilla ice cream and berries. That was a slice of awesome.

Shots are either grainy, blurry, way dark, or made unappealing by flash. Which is so sad, because the food here actually looks nice, and tastes good. Take for example the Seafood Doria on the weekend brunch menu. It's a variety of seafood and vegetables with a cream/cheese sauce over a bowl of rice. In practice, it'd be very easy to just send it out of the kitchen all jumbled up, but no. They will send it out well arranged, with a slight toasty crust on the cheese, all looking awesome. And it tastes better than it looks. Pretty unhealthy dish for a sushi spot to be honest, but worth the skipped treat or so afterwards.

I guess they must have gotten better treatment during that incident and was willing to give the place a second chance but separate incidents show that something is going on with the quality control here.If you can't keep foreign objects out of the sushi then I really question if they're handling their raw fish properly.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

I always wondered why this restaurant is not so popular and I found the reason: poor service of hosts. The asian women with messy hair at the counter is soooo rude. I made a pick up order and waited more than 40 mins to get my food. My order was placed and actually the food was ready in 15 mins but all the staff(there were 4) at the counter did was playing w cell and chatting each other. Especially the asian one consider customers as stupid like her and lied to me that my food is not ready because spider rolls need DEEP FRY and placed my order again lol. I also worked in Japanese restaurant so I know how things go. She was confused that my order was missed, so made duplicate order with a bad excuse. When another staff found out my food was already ready from 20 mins ago, she left the place in hurry still playing with her cell without any apologize. I was thinking about to have my boyfriend's b-day party in this restaurant, but I guess I will not going to visit this place for the rest of my life.

Oh and if it's your birthday, I think they give you a little free dessert. Yeah the food is good, but it's not amazing. I wasn't utterly wowed by anything but the sashimi was quite good, lots of different cuts of fish. The view is quite nice too if you get a good seat.

My boyfriend and I have been dining at this restaurant for over 10 years and have spent several valentine's day and anniversary dinners here! We always order the Smoky Tiger roll and constantly crave for the Creamy Nirvana roll. Avoid busy nights if you are uncomfortable with sitting near other parties, as the tables are arranged in close proximity to other diners. Try the avocado tempura (appetizer), and some special rolls (Super STsquared & Banana Mama). A lot of their older rolls are no longer on the menu, but the sushi chefs will still make them for you-- making their menu that much more extensive. Not a fan of sushi? Their chicken teriyaki is super tasty- served: with carrots; and over a bed of sweet onions drenched in teriyaki sauce. Still have room for dessert? Indulge in their selection of fried ice cream served with Pocky sticks.

I wanted to try a variety of their sashimi so I decided to order the chirashi bowl.  I also ordered a tuna hand roll since I feel the quality of tuna a restaurant has is a good indicator of how much they really care.  Shortly after ordering I was given a nice sized bowl of cold edamame and very hot miso soup.  The soup was above average thanks to it's temperature.15 minutes later I was handed my meal from one of the sushi chefs.  I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of both the chirashi bowl and the hand roll so no complaint there.  The sushi rice was a bit sweeter than I like it to be.  The biggest issue was the fish.  In the bowl on top of the rice was a mix of salmon, tuna, white tuna, yellowtail and what appeared to be mackerel. Nothing tasted very fresh.  The tuna quality in the bowl and the roll wasn't very good.  It was a very pale pink, no fat marbling whatsoever.I ended up leaving very full but a bit disappointed.My review is based on my one and only solo trip to the restaurant so as always I'll have to give it another shot sometime down the road.  Maybe after Hudson Country Restaurant week is over.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

243,QnFtargGI-J_k76-khvcKw,Jess L.,4.0 star rating,"One of the few good restaurants in Newport, it boasts a nice view of the water and the typical assortment of sushi rolls--my favorite being the Godzilla Roll: deep-fried roll of yellowtail and salmon with spicy sauce, scallions and masago.Aside from the sushi, the two things I love most here are the brunch and desserts. Offered on both Saturday and Sunday, you get brunch with a Japanese spin. The Crepe with Chicken is my usual choice: a savory mix of grilled chicken, mushroom, bakchoy, red pepper and nappa cabbage in a sweet and buttery white sauce on top of a crepe. But the New Omu-rice is equally good: chicken fried rice wrapped in an egg omelet, and topped with either tomato or curry sauce. Finish it off with a tasty dessert. You can never go wrong with the Ice Cream Tempura, aka Fried Ice Cream,  which is the best I've ever had (so far).Make sure to check the time accordingly before heading to brunch here. It doesn't open until 12:30pm. on Saturday and 1:00pm on Sunday. Pretty late for a weekend but still worth it.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Whenever I go to japanese, I expect to pay a little more than the average dinner, and I'm not one to complain about price, but it's definitely worth nothing that what you get for the price here is sorely disappointing. Sushi was average at best, and I think that's being generous. I mean, I try to enjoy the roll usually without wasabi or soy sauce, but let me just say they were so bland, extra wasabi was necessary to make it through this meal. Edamame tasted like they just reheated it from a microwave and dumped half a salt shaker on it.  Bottom Line: Sorely disappointing for dinner.

We said fine to dessert since it was my boyfriend's birthday.The bill came and we were still charged for everything minus the dessert and glass/plastic rolls. Her argument was that ""well you guys still drank the cokes, ate the other rolls, etc). By the way, we did not eat the other rolls because the waiter took our plates away.

If there is one thing that Komegashi understands is that you eat with your eyes first.  And that starts before even you see the food.  It starts when you see the restaurant.  The front of the restaurant doesn't look like much.  But then, as you get led to the main dinner room, the place really opens up.  Floor to ceiling windows with riverfront view line the back wall.  (If you have a party less than 2, you can get a table right next to the river.  If you have a larger party, you won't fit in those 2-tops.)  Now, I don't know about you, but river makes me happy.  The long work day starts to slowly fade away.  Then, warm towels.  Complimentary endamame.  It's a kinda of service that one can hardly find anymore.  Then, of course, it's all about the food.  And the food couldn't be better.  The fish was fresh and the presentation was so on point!  I tried the Chirashi.  This is my standby for a new sushi place.  It allows me to sample a lot of fish at once.  This is perhaps one of the most tasty Chirashi there is.  The rice has a little red bean mixed in.  It's not the most traditional, but it gives it that extra sweetness that was a welcoming twist.    The food was laid on top of that bed of rice like it was a work of art.  Typically, Chirashi is served in a bowl, with rice in the bottom and fishes laid on top.  Not here.  Such simple presentation won't do at Komegashi.  It is served on a square plate.  Rice was set up in a rectangular.  The fish was not laid on top.  It was rolled up and twisted and carefully placed on top the bed of delicious red bean rice.  I cannot, just cannot, do the art justice in words (I'm just not that good of a writer.)  But I did take a picture :DThen, I finished the meal with a green tea mousse and red bean ice-cream.  OMG!  So delish!  Did I need dessert after my yummy meal?  No.  Did I absolutely loved it?  You betcha!  Good thing was that Komegashi Too was located right by the Jersey City riverfront boardwalk.  So, after dinner, I just took a stroll to, um, burn off, the ice cream.By the time I finished my stroll, work was but a distant memory.  Komegashi makes for a wonderful night for just a simple workday meal or a romantic meal or just a meal with friends.  To top it all off, it's affordable.  You can't find a meal like this in Manhattan, and it's only a short PATH train away.  Love!!",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Lots of families here, kids screaming and professionals getting off after a long day.Hand towels to start the meal were a nice touch, although their menus could use a scrubbing over. Free edamame (cool, not cold, not warm, and a little slimey-er than normal makes me feel like they've been out a while). No place to add salt or soy sauce to dip, though. Then after a while, took our order and came out with it in stages.First, the fried chicken, legs with the meat pulled back away from the bone to make it an easy chewing experience. The meat needed to be seasoned a bit more, though, you could basically taste chicken...and that's it. Came out on a bed of sliced raw cabbage, piping hot.Second dish was better, the mamma mia salad. Cantaloupe, prosciutto, crumbled blue cheese (not enough!), pitted green olives, and four mildly cool boiled shrimp (they should be cold, not cool), in a bed of spinach and green salad drizzled with a sour vinagrette.  Best part was the bleu cheese, probably, followed by the melons which were surprisingly sweet.Last was an SUS roll - shrimp tempura inside (nicely crispy) and the outside was eel, avocado, spicy tuna, and masago. Tasty, and warm. Seven pieces to be split between my friend and I.Overall, food was better the later on the meal went - they definitely do sushi well, but the appetizers lacked luster. I suggest coming for the view, but it's not quite romantic on the weekdays, so watch your reservation, but the view is pleasant and the sushi satisfying.Oh, free parking in the garage across the way for the evenings/weekends. $2 for weekday lunch.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

Specified medium temperature, but received medium-well. That didn't really matter because the beef quality was excellent and was incredibly tender and juicy.

Liked what I saw and thought I'd take people here. VERY nice backroom area overlooking the marina and New York City.The room was farily quiet with few people and the music wasn't overpowering.Nice menu, decent selections till I got the Maki rolls; many things NOT Japanese traditional. Surprising and actually interesting.Had to ask what the IN/OUT sections were on the maki rolls (OK, old school I am) but got the gist; asked anyway. IN is inside the roll, OUT is what's decorating the outside of the roll. ----Minus tag, tax and licenses in US Dollars, each item I ordered:Newport Dragon roll, 13.50Tuna Roll, 6.00Cucumber Roll, 3.50Anago (SA) 4.50Eel Sashimi, 3.75Yellowtail Sashimi, 3.75Yellowtail Belly, 4.00Impressions...Newport Dragon roll was interesting. Decent flavor, but not much eel. I looked at the cross-section and confirmed the ratios.

WAY too much. Swimming in it. Couldn't taste the fish properly even though I had wiped most of it off. Disappointment.Yellowtail sashimi, yummy!The Yellowtail Belly was fishy. I have never tried that before, but I made the presumption that it would be more like the standard stuff. I'll look further and see.Lastly, I had a complementary 4Square-Sponsored order of Chicken Wings. Well, Segments.If you're a 4Square-er and a newbie to Komegashi, Komegashi will treat you to an order of these wing-drumetts. Order before you get your meal!They came well crispy (they way I like them) and, to my disappointment, were almost inedible. They were gooshy in the inside and lacked meat! These would be seriously good comfort food were they not to be lacking in depth or filling. -----The bill came to about $51 minus tip.I ordered more than I wanted, but got less than I thought. Portions were fine; they were spot-on, usual fare, but the quality was lackluster.I had been in the food business in my youth and have even managed a chain store as well as being a chef. Somehow, things were just not what I expected. Although the meal items were beautifully presented, they just missed and kept on missing.

I'd pass and take the PATH to 14th street in Astor to get my Japanese cravings.  I'd say, get their lunch portions as it's reasonably priced.One thing i was VERY disappointed was one of their Fusion dishes, where it was stir fried kimchi and vegetables mixed with a choice of meat.  The dish itself was good but the spice was NOT.  When the menu gives me options to indicate spice as : None, mild, medium, and VERY spicy, I expect ""Very spicy"".  Now, you'd think spice is measured differently but for the most part, when there's an adverb involved, the dishes usually come out with that flare.  This, not so much.  I'd say the menu needs some tweaking to add in, ""spice for amateurs"" and I'd leave it to that.  But, maybe that was part of the asian fusion experience.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

286,kSL6Wrqnz0MKApdU9qFUMQ,Anthony L.,2.0 star rating,"Fact: If you live in Newport, it's true that if you need anything decent that's at a convenient location, you will end up in Komegashi Too.After a few months, I've decided to give this restaurant a second chance--and have since been warming up to the restaurant... But I'm actually surprised today that the general manager (different from the manager I have issues with) approached me (they took the effort to track down what my real name is) and asked me to update my review. That kind of corroborated my suspicion that the restaurant aggressively manage reviews:- Evidence #1: first, imagine a restaurant, using their database of customer information/credit card!, match it against Yelp, and try to figure out what your last name is (Yelp don't show last names), and then track you down, walk over and talk to you. That's some detective work. And then asking me to update review and have my old review printed in front of her. Good detective work on 'going after' your customers. I have to question the legality/appropriateness of this.- Evidence #2: Homey T., who, including her Komegashi Too review, only has reviewed a grand total of 3 restaurants, posted a 4 star review ONE day after my negative review, justifying how I've misjudged the restaurant and made personal negative comments. She has never made another review since then (7/31/2011) on Yelp, so no reviews from (7/31/11 - 2/3/12). Tell me that's not someone affiliated with /friends /etc of the restaurant. Remember: someone who rarely posted and never posted since posted a 4 star review after my 1 star one day after my review. But then again this is just a guess. High probability guess? perhaps. But a guess nonetheless.Just something to be aware of. I feel restaurant owners should not even attempt to identify the customers, other than contact thru Yelp message. Don't the owners know it makes customer uncomfortable someone is matching their personal information against what Yelp displays? (first name, last initial). No customer would identify themselves as a particular user to the restaurant staff so please do not say the 'staff' recognize you. Thanks! (particularly since this is a restaurant that has traffic, mostly from Newport, NJ or close by in New Jersey)The manager's request sounded like she 'caught' me (shouldn't she appreciate a customer actually gave the restaurant a second chance?), but these people will never get it. Again, #2 is just a guess. Judge for yourself.To be fair, here's another assessment, not so skew towards customer-focus like last time:- yes, food is good, they do make a good effort on this. But pricey for the quality. But unlike many restaurants that are initially good and later cut corners, their quality is consistent- service is 'efficient': referring to 'speed' of service. - I give them credit for monitoring & learning from their reviews. That's important: they care about improving the restaurant. But aggressive management is a no-no.my advice: they have good food, a bit pricey. But the management has a lot to learn on their attitude towards customers. Can make you uncomfortable if you come across it. Privacy issue regarding their detective work. Taking into account all that? 2 star. In my view, on the things I've considered. That's an honest valuation.I wish Newport has plans to have another restaurant sometime soon, anything but the Mall please...",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

We usually go there twice a month and spend averagely $150 each time (usually 3-4 people) and for most of the time we tip more than 20%. That waiter is actually VERY good and we like him (the Asian dude).2. The manager is the problem. Don't know who she is (maybe your relative or your friend) but she acts like the customer's boss and yelled at me in front of everybody. She literally said to me ""Don't come back next time if you are not gonna pay 20%"" and she asked me to feel free to contact the owner regarding all the issues but refused to give me the number.3. In the beginning I was just questioning about the 20% tip but found the manager's attitude is extremely rude. The tip should represent the overall service not just the waiter's performance. In the end I left 15% tip but based on what we got from the manager I should have changed it to 0%.4. We have been there for over a year and the menu changed a LOT. Food became more and more expensive while the portion shrank a lot. We ordered 3 entrees and 3 appetizers but our bill was above $180.  At this price you can eat at Megu or some other much better Japanese restaurants in the city.Sorry to say this, but the management team in your restaurant sucks and the food price is really too high for such a neighborhood restaurant.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

We started off with the intention of just going in for a few rolls and drinks but ended up closing the place down! The quality of all the fish was superb, and having tried a lot of different things off the menu it was impressive. We started with sake and wine which again our server was amazing at his suggestions, and we ended up drinking a whole bottle of each, whoops haha. Once the food came we had the  Beef Negimaki, sashimi sampler, philly roll, spicy tuna roll, the smoky tiger roll, and the samurai steak! Honestly for two people I don't know how we ate and drank that much but somehow we didn't leave anything behind!

My cousin and his wife ordered a shared sushi platter - that also looked decent for the price. This place's fish is good enough for a neighborhood sushi joint. I wouldn't travel across town to go here, but its perfectly fine if you are in that areas.Ambiance - good enough. Yes, it has a view of some water. The night before we actually dined at Michael Anthony just across the way from this place - it was funny to have a view of the Michael Anthony restaurant.Service - I noticed some people on yelp complained but I found the service excellent. We were warmly greeted and they quickly set up a table for four adults + a 2 year old requiring a high chair and some space for our 4 month in a stroller. Thumbs up all around. Waitress was also nice and the rest of the staff was prompt and attentive. I actually do'nt have much recollection of most of the service but at no time did I feel like I was waiting for anything.

I was very pleased with the staff, they were always right on it when I needed to order extra or just need water. The food wasn't so bad either.

Thanks to a well-balanced combination of mayo and sauce, I don't even bother dipping my sushi into soy sauce. I recommend the BBQ Lover roll, the Spider roll, and the ST squared roll. The sushi is a little pricey but certainly comparable to almost any sushi place in NYC (and the price is well-worth the quality of food you're getting).In addition to the Special rolls, I recommend getting the over rice meals (sukiyaki-ju, katsu-ju, etc). Very satisfying and authentic. =)The ambiance and service is very nice here.

The decor is very nice; nice sushi bar with 3-4 sushi chefs, nice bar, and the dine-in seating and music is set to the perfect level where you can have a nice conversation with your company and not be bothered by conversations of other diners. The lighting is set nicely and there are two televisions by the bar which provide perfect sports entertainment for today where the Yankees are holding their home opener against the Angels. The restaurant has a great view of the marina and its far enough but not too far from the offices. The bartenders and wait staff are very nice and responsive. I can certainly see people coming here after work for drinks and sports. The food itself isn't particularly fantastic but it will do for a sushi place in Jersey City. Generally, my standards for sushi are pretty high so I don't blame this restaurant, I do blame the wonderful experiences I've had at other places. I had the sashimi and it was just okay, not the freshest but still very edible. One of my colleagues had the curry chicken and he said it was ""good."" My other colleague had the sushi and sashimi combination and though it was ""alright."" Another colleague of mine had the chicken katsu I believe and she liked it. The price point of their food is on par with most places in New York and New Jersey, but would be relatively expensive compared to comparable places in the other boroughs of New York. Overall, a pleasant experience. I can't say that I would come here often, but when I do get the itch for sushi in the middle of the work day, I would certainly come here if I can't wait to get back to Manhattan for sushi.

I couldn't get enough of the ginger dressing on that salad, I even requested a little extra in case I got greedy. The eel was a tad bit small, but good nonetheless, and there was a generous amount of eel sauce and ginger for me to enjoy.Now the beef negimaki was SO, SO, good. For people who don't know, negimaki is basically sushi, but with beef on the outside, scallion on the inside, and a yum-tastic sauce on top. The beef was so juicy and the scallion so crisp, I nearly died with each bite.I've had a few versions of green tea ice cream, my favorite being Monster Sushi's. This spin on it was very bitter and I didn't care for it at all. All matcha, and no sweetness.My drinks for the night included Sapporo and plum wine w/ my dessert. Both very good.

I hardly ever expect a restaurant located in an office building to serve really good food.  It's right outside the Newport PATH station, past the parading yuppies; upon entering, there's nothing officey or corporate about it.  After galavanting all over Manhatten, fighting gay parade traffic, and feeling queasy about my dinner with some mucho VIPs, Komegashi's  quiet waterfall-on-the-wall, dark bamboo and teak furnishings, quiet jazz on the overhead,  fantastic view of the marina were all soothing to me.Started out with some zaru-soba to clean out the system. Pretty standard buckwheat with cold ponzu. Then on to some nigiri; the fish tasted fresh and was like buttah on my tongue. Only thing was they didn't put a small dab of wasabi between the fish and rice, but maybe the're catering to the general clientele here.  Tried some negimaki which was tender and slightly sweet.  Then we tried several rolls: the Dragon was rich and slightly briny - bit too heavy for me.  There was the Pink Panther with strawberries and mango, which I could have as a dessert roll, with a fruity sweetness that wasn't overpowering the fish. Then we tried something called a Banana Mama which is unagi with banana, freaky, but the combination worked for me.  I was dining with a large group and some had ordered the beef shabu-shabu, which I got to sample.  I thought the vegetables were lacking variety  but the beef was very tender and so good with the sesame dipping sauce.  I could've poured that sauce down my throat with nothing else, it was so light and creamy.The bar carries everything but I stuck with an organic nigori served chilled.  The waitstaff was super attentive and never let any of us pour our own drinks.The food is probably expensive even for NYC standards but for 6 people, including 5 bottles of sake and 2 large beers and tip the total was under 5 bills.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"
372,G_rIDjEagT12ucyEg4blog,Edward I.,4.0 star rating,The location is perfect if you have no car and are willing to take the Path train to Newport. It's not far from the city (takes 15 minutes) and has a great view of the lower part of Manhattan. A nice walk around the area will make you realize that Jersey City isn't a bad area after all. Price is a little high but I also recommend the main restaurant on Montgomery Ave. BTW the restroom rocks!,Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

374,qIV77ocR0q6wZyNj67VL9w,Matt W.,5.0 star rating,"This is a hidden gem of the NYC metro area, especially being in Jersey City, and also kinda off the beaten path.  I am not a huge sushi person, which is probably why most people like this place, so it is good that they have a diverse menu.  Their chicken teriyaki is as simple as it comes (chicken in teriyaki sauce and some veggies with rice on the side) yet is done to perfection. The chicken is so tender and also a nice large portion. Great with a one liter can of Asahi beer.  My friends also tell me the sushi is good.The scenic manhattan views are over-rated unless you actually sit by a window.  Otherwise, the interior decor is nice.One more bonus: free mints on the way out.  Gotta love that",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"

The sushi and sahimi are great and you can always ask to be made any way you like.

378,mbV7tPVh-5aTDP26kYDzsQ,Sooz V.,5.0 star rating,"I am a big fan of Komegashi Too. The food is really tasty (better than the other sushi places in Hoboken, where I live) and the view of the Hudson is so pretty. I never felt the prices were particularly high, but maybe there are cheap places in JC?I am shocked that so many people noted poor service. I've always had a really good experience with everyone at Komegashi. I've had a few different servers - all were knowledgeable and very nice. The few times I've gone the restaurant was pretty busy, but I didn't feel rushed. One time when there was a wait the hostess suggested we wait at the bar for our table, and the bartender (Kelli, I think) was very nice. I thought the hostess herself was very sweet, no problems there. During our meal the manager (Lisa) came over to see how everything was. She got me a drink refill without just telling me to wait for my server, which I thought was really nice. Excellent service from everyone I came in contact with...I don't know what the reviewers are talking about regarding snooty people at Komegashi! It sounds some of these reviewers were trying to come in when the restaurant was closing, etc. and you can't expect a restaurant to change its hours just for you...in my opinion.I'm a big fan of Komegashi and highly recommend it! Excellent food, really nice atmosphere with the water view, and very kind service.",Komegashi Too,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Bars"
