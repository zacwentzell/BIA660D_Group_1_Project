No doubt, you get value here.I typically order delivery, even though it's so close. The restaurant itself is also nice, and the service is typically great, although there were a few minor, forgivable hiccups in the past. The only thing that's holding this place back from a full 5 stars is their dining set up.

The liquor store next door is very convenient but the lack of variety in sake is highly disappointing, so maybe opt for wine. We ordered three different types of rolls. They were all pretty good. Why am I giving them a 3 star? Well.. they're a 4 star IN Hoboken, but the review isn't based on just Hoboken. The food is fusion - don't expect to have a real sushi experience here.

It's probably the best west of Washington St and caters to a neighborhood crowd. There is an abundance of sushi rolls for all tastes. For lunch they have decent specials including bento-style boxes. The Seafood Udon Noodle soup is good too. At dinner I tend to stick with the Sashimi Deluxe special that is reasonably priced and the fresh pieces are fair sizes. Although the fish selection is pretty standard American, check out the few daily or weekly specials on the board. Service is quick and just wave if you need their attention. Added plus: BYOB, one of my favorite things about Hoboken. There's a wine shop in the same strip mall, so just buy a bottle before going to the restaurant.One weird note: Using the takeout menu flier as the in-dining menu is pretty tacky.",Okinawa Sushi & Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Thai"

We ordered the sushi for two (assorted sushi, eel avocado roll, and rainbow roll), which comes with two salads or soups. I wasn't a fan of the eel avocado roll but that's only because I don't like eel, so I can't hold that against Okinawa. Other than that, everything else was good.We also ordered the Okinawa salad, which was tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna with seaweed salad and radishes. I was expecting more of a 'salad' but in reality, it was just seaweed salad topped with chunks of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna, with a few pieces of radish haphazardly thrown in there. But at least the fish tasted fresh, so that's all I really care about.This seems to be the least expensive/best deal in the Jersey City/Hoboken area, so I would definitely order from here when that sushi craving hits again (which is pretty often!)",Okinawa Sushi & Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Thai"

80,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"Sushi is great here! There are definitely some better sushi places in the city, but this place beats out any place I've tried in Hoboken, by far. I'm pretty picky about my sushi - the fish has to be fresh, the rice has to be cooked well and the right texture, the ingredients have to pair well together and be proportioned well in each roll. Okinawa meets all the criteria. It's on the pricier side, so you won't be getting one of those $20 all-you-can-eat deals, but the quality sushi is definitely worth it.The nabeykai udon was very good - a comfort food, for sure. It had chicken, mixed veggies, fish cake, a bit of (imitation) crab, a poached egg, and two pieces of shrimp tempura on the side. I was glad the tempura was on the side so it didn't get soggy in the soup. The broth was light and very flavorful, and the chicken was still tender and not overcooked.I've also tried the Thai Spicy Chicken, which I thought was cooked very well. It wasn't quite what I expected - it was a bit creamy and maybe a little coconut-y. Not usually my cup of tea, but I still enjoyed my meal and I think others who like those flavored would think it was even more tasty. The service was also friendly and quick here. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. She brought out our appetizers very quickly, which we loved. Afterwards, one of our meals was brought out first and it took a long time for the other entree to come out (so neither of us were eating), maybe another 10 minutes. The waitress noticed this (without us saying anything) and came to let us know that the dish was coming and apologized for the inconvenience. She also was very nice to offer us an order of edamame on the house :)Each table had fresh flowers this past time I went here - it was a nice touch.

I wish someone would've said they are a Chinese restaurant. Or a Thai restaurant. Or anything else, but they are definitely not a Japanese restaurant. I don't like crossover food. If you have a focus, do that. But Chinese people do not know anything about sushi. You don't see Russians making tacos, and there's a reason for that.Anyway, when we got there, there were employees sleeping at one table. Hmmm....maybe should've left then?The lights were very bright, I thought I was at the tanning salon next door. The TV was on. I could've just stayed home if I wanted to watch the news. The server was nice, but we had to do the back and forth with our order a hundred times, still not sure if we were getting what we ordered. We (actually, I) spilled water everywhere, but no one noticed.OK, the sushi itself was a C-, Not sure how ""fresh"" it was. Tasted frozen. The mackerel was scary. The tamago was weird. Kind of chemical taste all the way around. Was that sushi rice or just plain white rice? Wait..wait for it... the kicker= HAIR IN OUR FOOD!!! NO WAY!!!And that's the end of our dining experience there folks. I tried to remain calm as the very nice manager comped our food so I could go outside and puke it back up.We took our sake and Sapporo to Robongi, where we were so thankful to have fresh, huge portions of the most amazing fish.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, including the sushi pizza, octopus, and tuna dumpling. They were all great, the tuna dumpling was my personal favorite even though it was really big and a little tricky to eat. My mom got udon and loved it, the rest of us got a bunch of rolls to share. The best ones were the Sweet Heart and the Pink Lady rolls (the Pink Lady was really big but the pieces of fish were sooo fresh and tasty, it didn't matter--catch me shoveling those in my mouth next time I'm in Hoboken). The Sandwich roll was funny--literally a little sandwich! It could have used more fish because I got a couple bites that were mostly avocado and rice but it was a cool idea. We also got sashimi to share which was also delicious. Big pieces of fish, and when we told them we didn't like white tuna they swapped it out for a different kind of fish.

We got seated right away so that was a good sign but it went down hill from there. Food is okay okay and service is horrible, the waitress was very rude and took for ever to clean the table after appetizers. I dropped some water on the table and she didn't even bother to put tissues on the floor. So we just went along with the food and drinks without any visit from the waitress to see if the food was good or if we needed anything else.  Right after we finished she came and dropped off the bill without even asking us if we were done with the food or if we needed any dessert. We were planning to order desert but after what happened, we no longer were in a mood to sit there any longer. I had to walk over to the main hostess by the front door to pay the bill.

And the food is hot.I'd heard all good things about this new sushi place. I love all Japanese cuisine and am always willing to give new roll creations a try. My friend suggested the chicken and pork gyoza, which I ordered, along with the dancing eel roll and shrimp tempura hand roll.The wait time on seamless was 60-70 minutes, so imagine my delight when my door rang 25 minutes after I had placed my order. Saliva filled my mouth as soon as I opened my (hot!) appetizer and my eyes landed on my beautiful Japanese opus.Gyoza was fantastic and plentiful. I believe there were 6 pieces (maybe more, I was too overcome with joy to stop and chew). Crisp, not soggy. Flavors were great and not overpowering. I'll definitely be reordering. The tempura on the shrimp was crispy, all ingredients were super fresh. I couldn't eat it fast enough (but was trying to desperately savor every morsel while I could). I really didn't use much soy sauce because the eel sauce was so good (and I didn't want to lose the roll flavor). Just fyi , I can eat a LOT. Many of my guy friends have commented on my man vs food tendencies. This meal completely satisfied me. Overall, super happy with my choice.It's a bit on the pricier side as far as Hoboken sushi goes (gyoza+hand roll+special roll after tax and tip came to $30) but there are a few other specialty rolls I'd still like to try.

We've tried most of the sushi spots in hoboken and this beats them all in quality and freshness. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but there's not a lot of stiff competition in hoboken. Another perk: delivery is fast and easy on Seamless.The reason I'm not rating this place five stars: I ordered two rolls last time during lunch special hours. Because I did not specify the words ""lunch special"" (I only realized that my order qualified after placing the order), I was charged full price instead of the lunch special price. It was only a few dollars difference, but it's a turn off to feel as if a place is taking advantage of it's customers.All in all, I will continue to frequent Okinawa because of it's convenience and quality.",Okinawa Sushi & Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Thai"

The delivery man was apologetic and told me to call the restaurant.The woman who picked up was annoyed, unapologetic and said she'd send the roll back to Jersey city shortly. Then, almost a half hour later the roll did not show up and I called to tell her to cancel the additional roll. (It was 10:00, I had ordered at 8:30 and did not want it anymore). The woman said it had already left the restaurant and she was very passive aggressive, placing the blame on me for telling her to send the missing roll in the first place. After some discussion of a refund on that roll, she let me know that this was ""impossible"" and offered a $5 coupon and hung up on me very abruptly.

Salmon Don entree that comes with a soup/salad costs about $22 and comes with a good portion of sushi rice, topped with furikake and seasoned perfectly with subtle vinegar flavor- order included 15 well sized and fresh tasting nice cuts of melt-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi. Tuna roll was fresh and perfectly sized. There were generous amounts of wasabi, ginger and soy sauce included in the order. Miso soup was very good and not skimpy on the seaweed and tofu.

Let's start with the good...delivery. Okinawa has holy sh*t fast delivery. One minute you're ordering and the next you're answering your door to welcome their amazing food into your home. Usually on a weekend night you'll get your food within 20 minutes. I live pretty far uptown and the longest I've ever waited was 35 minutes. The food has always arrived piping hot, fresh and delicious. Highly recommend their pad Thai and avocado salad. The avocado salad has a large portion of avocado but to be honest, the lettuce could be better quality. Their dressing is to die for. In house is meh at best. The last time I sat down to eat here it was a busy Friday night. And by busy I mean every table was full and waiters were running back and forth with take out orders. Both times I've eaten in here the waiters were not as attentive as they should have been. They forget things or they just don't listen. I've had them forget to bring rolls out, put in ingredients that were requested to be omitted and bring out the wrong entree. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they're busy but Ive been here when it's slow and they've done the same thing. I do love Okinawa but their in house experience is not great.

207,O6fiNB4YIWegi6l_usnTDw,Julia A.,3.0 star rating,"Ordered take out & picked up- delivery estimate was 55 minutes on a Sunday night (crazy!) I ordered the special tuna roll that is highly rated on seamless and a salmon avocado roll w/miso soup. The crazy tuna roll was definitely a good choice! Their salmon and avocado roll I was less impressed with- salmon wasn't as fresh. Miso soup was also average. All in all, I'd say this is definitely a solid sushi place for Hoboken. I'd say it's comparable to sushi house, though I think I'd prefer Okinawa over sushi house any day. I'd like to come back to sit down to experience their service since I can't comment on that. Also their lunch specials are quite a steal!",Okinawa Sushi & Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Thai"

I had their Shrimp Pad Thai and my friends had Chicken Pad Thai as well and they were SUB-PAR. Easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had! It was bathed in some pink sauce that made it sweet like a dessert. Pad Thai is not supposed to be sweet! My friends agreed with me that the taste was not right. Another friend got a salmon dish and he said that was awesome so I think it's safe to say that this place doesn't do Thai cuisine nearly as well as Japanese cuisine.",Okinawa Sushi & Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Thai"

We had the Oki Roll and a few tuna avocado rolls (we kept it simple) The tuna was very fresh, they did not skimp out. The rice was soft and warm... You know, the way it should be.

I called the restaurant and originally the lady who picked up said that the lady who took the order is new and she didn't understand. When told she called to clarify the new lady said she didn't even speak to anyone because no one picked up. That's not true. I spoke to her and clarified. So she begins arguing with me saying it's not entirely their fault. After 5 minutes of back and forth she said she'll send me another. Which she did, the correct order, but with no soy sauce.
