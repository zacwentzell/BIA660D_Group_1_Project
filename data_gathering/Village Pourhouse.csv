0,Ox6NXoHS5rFQ3FA_-oKdaQ,Christina B.,4.0 star rating,"Village Pourhouse is one of the many sports bars in Hoboken. It has a ton of TVs so naturally a lot of people come here to watch the games. On Sundays you can pre-reserve tables to watch the game and eat. When it's really crazy, barstool seating is also reserve-only.Village Pourhouse has decent food as well. The loaded fries were our favorite, followed by nachos. Totachos are also a crowd pleaser.

1,zqiRZvNjAUNAupuMSFhrrg,Anna-May A.,3.0 star rating,"Came here for the advertised Wednesday night $5 Beer and Burger special.Sounds too good to be true, huh? Well, yes... you DO get a burger and a beer for $5 but the beer is a 12oz pour of Coors Light or YuengLing and the burger is a 2oz slider patty that you can get bacon or cheese on, no additional fixings.The burger itself was yummy though it could have had more flavor. Since its slider size, I can eat 4 of these but at $20, you're better off just buying a regular size burger (which actually comes with fries or tots) for $12.Also, we ordered a serving of tots ($6) to go with our sliders and beer. You'd think the tots just go in the fryer and would come out right away... Not at this place that night. The tots didn't come out until way after we were done with our first Beer/Burger special.My boyfriend said something to the bartender about how the tots are supposed to go WITH the burger and not eaten as an afterthought. She just shrugged her shoulders and said, ""the kitchen must be busy."" Besides us, there was maybe, at best, 10 other people in the bar. So unless all of  those people ordered the whole menu, there's absolutely no reason for the odd delay in serving the food.",Village Pourhouse,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, American, (Traditional)"

The bar is located on the southend of Hoboken, a few blocks down from Washington near City Hall and about 1/4 mile from Hoboken Terminal. I have only had beer here primarily because that's all I trust in this place. If I were to come on a night there wasn't karaoke I'd probably be miserable.

There were a total of maybe 3 to 5 bartenders working and they were trying their best, but they were over welmed and barely paying attention to you. it took forever to get a drink. everything was very unorganized, i thin they sold too many tickets for this type of set up. like i said walking in, its set up a bit weird..and the wrap around bar allows a narrow area for people to walk by. theres also tables, which are nice but when you're trying to host something this big---i suggest clearing out the tables...just have chairs.i came here last night for a private event on yelp. it was a completely different animal. we are capable of actually having a private area which is marked off from the rest of the bar--so if u wanna have a party..this might be the right answer for you. the staff last night was nice and worked with us to accommodate anything. i actually tried some drinks which were great---not sure how much $ because it was for free. the food was good. i suggest getting the hummus.  the chicken sandwich was spicy but good. the buffalo chicken salad was great---i think they should use a little less buffalo sauce but it wasn't terrible at all.maybe in the future il come here for a happy hour, i just think it gets way to packed and the beer fest just gave me such a bad taste in my mouth about how it was organized.",Village Pourhouse,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, American, (Traditional)"

While Friday and Sat night may be just another crowded hot Hoboken bar, the really good stuff is on the other days of the week. I briefly alluded to the dueling pianos (on Thursdays I think), which is something fun and different.  What I failed to realize was that each night has something unique and worth visiting. Case in point: last Tuesday, I was freezing my butt off in Hoboken. All the bars I stopped in had a handful of people - not a very good night to go out I guess. I strolled by Village Pourhouse and what do I find?  A casual drinks setting....but a ticket for 1 free taco with every drink purchased. What the what?These weren't some random crappy tacos - I had 2 of them and was pretty content.

Another time was during a weekday and it felt nice and laid back. Nothing crazy like the weekends where it can be like a frat house. There was even trivia which made for funny conversations amongst my group AND free taco night (I forget what night it is)! During the bad trips to Pourhouse, I walk in to a not so crowded evening with 3 friends, sit down at the bar, and proceed to wait about 15 minutes for our first drink. We kept getting the bar back telling to wait one minute for 1 of 2 or 3 bartenders, 1 of them off to the side having a hilarious conversation. This happened on two different visits and we only stuck around for 1 drink and left. Overall, the place is huge compared to some other Hoboken bars and very sports friendly.

Sometimes it has been to finish a night of drinking or changing up the scenery, sometimes it has been for an event or a happy hour, and others it has been the food destination. The place is pretty weirdly shaped but the crowd is always diverse and the staff is always pretty friendly and accommodating, not matter how overwhelmed they get. There is something off putting about the layout, but it divides the space creating different compartments and different feelings, but no matter where you are in the spot, you get prompt enough help. The bathrooms are kind of tiny, but you kind of expect that when walking into the dark bar, sporting faux rustic décor and tons of tv screens.I can honestly say, I am more than an eater than a drinker, and they have a pretty sizeable menu for a place I have seen with sticky floors and hardcore dancing. The drink prices are reasonable and the happy hour deals are pretty decent as well. There is a great variety of beers and some random alcohol choices.But most times, food is on my mind. My boyfriend said more than once that the burgers are pretty good, considering. So that night following some pretzel appetizer bites and  happy hour special sangria, I ordered the Magic 'Shroom Burger. This first time, the burger was amazing with its sautéed mushrooms, crispy bacon, arugula and warm cheese sauce. There was something so addictive and delicious about it, I could not stop thinking about how tasty that burger was.So the next time we went after half of an Angry Orchards Cider, I ordered that Magic 'Shroom Burger again, this time, it was far less appetizing.

I was super confused by the entrance. There are 2 doors, 1 is covered in a black curtain, the other was open, but when I looked inside I saw a strange hallway instead of the bar I was expected. After a little more investigation of the outside, I decided this must be the entrance. When I emerged from the strange hallway entrance, I found the bar I was expecting. It basically just looked like a bar. It was kinda ginormous. There was a threesome sitting at this side of the bar (its round-ish) & 1 bartender. I stood at the entrance for a moment not knowing if I needed to be seated or not. After not being approached by anyway, I decided to try my luck on the other side of the bar, as I thought I saw another bartender there. I walk around and there she is, along with 1 lone patron. I ask if I should sit anywhere and decide to take a seat at the bar to make it easier on everyone.I had purchased a $10 for $20 deal on Yelp and expected to use it all. I did not. The menu was more extensive than I expected/like in a bar menu. I decided on a lamb burger (its not something I see often on Hoboken menus). There was also a happy hr special for the ""Pour"" burger and fries for $5.95 (will try next time). I forgot to ask for the lamb burger without the harissa sauce (I hate harissa) but was able to catch her to make the note in time. Phew! Both mine and the other patron's food came out rather quickly (I think she got the Pour burger). The burger wasn't bad. It wasn't all that ""good"" either though. It was kinda of...acceptable. To their defense, I forever compare all lamb burgers to the 1 at the Breslin (I know its not fair, but my taste-buds don't care [lol that rhymed]). Everything on the burger tasted pretty fresh...but all I could really taste were the onions & cheese. I really couldn't even tell you what burger itself tasted like. The fries were pretty decent. I also ordered a sprite with a refill. After all of this, my total was about $16. What? I didn't make it to $20. I thought about ordering something else to get to there but I was stuffed off just half that burger and it would have been ridiculous.

71,RuGta8bVTEE0urfLPHrpFA,S B.,2.0 star rating,"Not so much a pourhouse as a frat house. That about sums it up. Classic Jersey crowd. You know, the dog tags, the sparkle skull shirts with ornate fonts, gel. Also, plenty of lax finance dudebros and the princesses that follow them around for reasons unbeknownst to humanity. Wear your best backwards hat!For better or worse, the place can appeal to whatever your mood. Want to watch a game? You can! Shake it to Rihanna? Yes! Play beer pong or flip cup? No problem. Have dinner? Got it. Feel special in a reserved section? Better book ahead! And you can do all this in the same night. I suppose the theme here is whatever you want it to be and it's tough to gripe with that. They do have all daily activities like trivia and karaoke to lure you inside. The PA system, however, is awful and you can't really hear the trivia or song being sung. Standard pub fare and prices. Good drinking food and padding for the night. Service is hit or miss. Sometimes entrees come first and sometimes you may not see a server for 20 minutes. Other times, everything is on point with a smile. My primary gripe is that the place boasts all these beer options, but it seems a bit misleading. Not false advertising, but close. It's not uncommon for them to be out of many of the very brews that you would visit a pourhouse to enjoy. My record is 11 inquiries before getting one that was available. This voluminous beer list seems to be a bit more for show and most roads lead back to the generic stuff. At least the pitchers of that are cheap. Also, a year or so ago, maybe longer, they offered a coupon deal for ""flights of beer from around the world."" It included Molson and Heineken. Good effort and thoughtfulness, VP. Per First Street, you'll be paying $5 for Buds or Millers as this is Coors territory. Or was anyways.The crowd skews pretty young and although it looks like a big place at a glance, it runs out of space quick. One side has these long tables that almost run into the bar and, being Hoboken, everyone just kind of likes to stand around. So if you're seated at the end of these tables then be prepared for shufflers and staggerers brushing against you. And don't be surprised if you turn to one side and have someone's ass in your face. The group table setup is really no-man's land. Whomever designed and planned this interior owes an apology.Overall, it is what it is. If you're under 25 you'll probably love it here.

I like the bar setup, and they have ample space to move around (when there's room to move around, that is). This place has a line every single Friday and Saturday night. Why? I have no idea.The beer list is extensive, the food menu is not. Just your typical bar food, and it's not that good. I went this past Thursday night to watch basketball, and we got wings, a burger and grilled cheese - all incredibly average. Grilled cheese served on Texas toast? It's actually just white bread.

The quality of the place really depends on what you're looking for. Its definitely a college or ""i just graduated college"" bar. The crowd is predominately under 25 and geared towards the frat party scene. The crowd is largely out of towners bc its walking distance from the trains. The music is sooo loud you cant heard the person next to you so its definitely not a place to go just to chill. Though the place has a large space to dance theres a long large bar that its very difficult to move around esp when it gets crowded. Also, the bar is understaffed! You could wait over10mins for the bartender to look your way. This causes a line up at the bar which makes already small space tighter to move around in. I moved to the corner of 1st and willow a year ago so I get to hear the crowd of drunk bros yelling and screaming whenthe bar closes. If you're young 21-24 and still want that college scene than you'll really like this place.

136,fe_NLW71jhHElhXaRiuqqA,Andrew Z.,5.0 star rating,"I co-own a charitable company that host barcrawls and various social gatherings throughout Hoboken. In the last few years I have worked with many bars and restaurants throughout the  local area and I can honestly say that hosting events at the Village Pourhouse (owned by Funbars.com) has really helped bring our events to the next level. For one, they are very flexible. When hosting charity events there is always some risk with guaranteeing money spent or a minimum amount of guests, and this can be challenging for an altruistic function. The Village Pourhouse doesn't mandate any ""minimums,"" and on top of that, they are extremely generous with their specials and offerings for large groups. Another huge plus is the space and the fact that there is plenty of it. We usually rent out the skybox in the back of the bar - it's perfect for a large, casual group. Lastly, and probably the most important, is the customer service. Jesse was Managing during my most recent event, and he was hands on throughout the entire night. Not only did he cater to the immediate needs of the guests, but he really stepped up and went above and beyond to help the event run smoothly. This was especially important for me since it took a lot of the organizational pressure off my shoulders and allowed me to mingle with the guests and promote the cause. Jesse was awesome, and I couldn't thank him enough for all the support he gave us. I highly recommend doing an event at Hoboken's Village Pourhouse and I will continue to plan events there and involve them anyway I can.",Village Pourhouse,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, American, (Traditional)"

We only had bite-sized foods of the list above, but I would definitely go back for a meal and drink, and to watch the game!!  (TVs were very abundant - and yes, the music was somewhat loud, but it's a bar!  What do you expect?!)  it's a very casual place, great for meeting friends, grabbing a bite and beer and just ""chillaxing""....  PS - we met the chef, and the manager - VERY friendly couple of guys - the staff itself (servers, bartenders) did an excellent job as well!  PPS - parking in Hoboken can be a nightmare - street parking available - with muni-meters (parking meters), and there are parking garages in the area as well.  We lucked out and found a spot a block away...
