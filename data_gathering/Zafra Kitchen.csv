0,MKIBk4JAF8RPmrtjzeb75g,Regina A.,5.0 star rating,Great local Latin American restaurant (affiliated with Cucharamama & Ultramarinos). The restaurant is BYOB which I wasn't aware of until I tried ordering the sangria! Had the skirt steak which was cooked to perfection (add a little chimichuri sauce to further enhance the meat). Portions are very generous and come with rice and excellent beans. This left no room to try desserts. My dinner companion had the chicken skewers and started with a tamale which was excellent. We'll tryvthe small plates next time!,Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

My wife had rendez vous to try something else in Hoboken, it is across Hoboken University medical  Center,  it is colorful and quite charming . It's a BYOB, but they offer to suggest get a bottle of discounted wine at their other restaurant , the Cucharamama (mom's spoon), which really looks nice. I got to try it, plus it apparently is a hot Latino food place in  town. now Zaffra, 's food was average and small portion, so We were not too impressed with it , we had Tamal de pollo y Rajas, papa rellena, crema de calabazza, empanadilla con pebre.

What more can you ask for? We started out with the Yuca Fries with Cilantro Sauce Presilla and the Empanadas - OMG. Both were amazing. The Cilantro dipping sauce was really phenominal for the fries. The Empanadas are small - fair warning. If you have a group, I suggest ordering 3 or 4 little dishes. For lunch, we ordered the Tostadas con Tinga and the Argentinean-style Skirt Steak. Can't even explain how amazing both of these dishes were. Very flavorful. My only complaint is that there were flies circling us as we ate outside - I wish the restaurant would add outdoor fans to try and prevent this.

During the day I like stop by for a coffee or a casual lunch - their pressed sandwiches are all excellent - and at night I like to order a bunch of things to make a tapas style dinner. Everything here is very tasty and one of my favorite things to order is the vegetable plate.

As it is, I would go any day of the week and have. It's BYO, super affordable and delicious. That staff is so kind and welcoming. The inside is cute, but fairly small (I've never had a problem getting a table, though). The outside seating in the spring/summer is adorable. There's one coveted table with strung lights near some shrubbery that I've never had a party big enough to sit in, but that's my goal! The warm bread they bring out is TO DIE FOR (I have dreams about it) and you can ask for more and they won't charge you for it :). The meat balls and croquettes are delish, but I've never had anything I didn't like here. Just go!

12,hj9NOt0sDoEWaRMX8EDj1w,Steve N.,4.0 star rating,"Zafra Kitchen is a quaint little Cuban restaurant in the heart of Hoboken. Their menu also has dishes from all over Latin America. It's a BYO, so the best part about that is that you can bring your own alcohol and they will make any variety of cocktails for you using many of their fresh tropical fruit.  Oh, and the food is great too! They are even open for brunch on the weekend. They have a variety of tamales, which must be tried if you decide to come here. Some of the things I've enjoyed are marinated pork, Chimichurri strip steak, and of course their Cuban sandwiches. If you decide to bring rum, order their Guanabana Daiquiri and thank me later!

So far the only thing I see that can kind of beat Las Vegas food is the Cuban bread (hard to com by here), and the Pan con Lechon. But the portions are not very generous at all. Just do a lot of nice plating with nice unique plateware,but nothing to jump up and rave about! I'll stay with my hometown food here in Las Vegas thank you very much! Specifically the Camarones enchilados portion looks very sad! Its a shame for such an extremely known and awarded Chef...amazing? If you're so famous..got various restaurants?

You really have to take these reviews with a grain of salt... in either case, I wasn't too impressed. Tried the chicken skewers and Ropa Vieja and was really unimpressed with both. Chicken skewers were cooked too well done and were kind of dried out. The Ropa Vieja was sort of tough, probably could have been stewed/cooked longer to make it more tender. Flavor was OK, not great.I think the prices are high for the quality you receive. I wouldn't have minded as much if the skewers only cost $14-16 and the Ropa Vieja $15-17. Portions are really small also. The five dollar tapas are miniature. An order of empanadas is equivalent to the size of ONE empanada in two slices... Not a big deal since it was only $5, but it is on the skimpy side.BYOB is nice, couldn't complain there. Service was just OK. Not great. It was empty when I went and the attention was mediocre. Waiter didn't seem too attentive of what was going on. Didn't serve any water which I thought was weird until we asked for it.

The food alone should keep you coming back again and again. The service is a little lackluster. They're never enthusiastic but you can expect to wait a little bit for them to come take your order and for the check to arrive after you've requested it. All in all, not a huge blemish on a very tasty meal, but keeps this place out of the 5 star review category. Personally I enjoy the tamales, tostadas con tingas and the ropa vieja. Their cafe con leche is hard to beat and as a special added bonus, their loose leaf tea options are a nice surprise.

We're huge fans of The Cuban also in Hoboken but try to opt for this place since it's BYOB and also a bit less expensive. The food has always consistently been pretty good, but never really the best. Out of all three times, we have never had great service here but this time we were positive we're never coming back. We weren't greeted to be seated even after making eye contact with the woman behind the bar. It's really small in the restaurant and once we were seated it always feels like you're on top of the next table, especially if you're a party of two. It seemed like the table next to us was getting very attentive service, while it seems like people were just walking right past us and we had to flag someone down to get served. It was about 20 minutes until we actually spoke to someone about what we wanted for food, but they did take our drink order early-ish. We had no idea who our server was because about four different people were talking to us and bringing us things throughout our meal.We had the empanadas as an appetizer which were really really good and we've also gotten before. For our entrées, we both got the Churrasco which comes with rice and beans, which looked great when they came out and tasted good, but just seems like it could have used a bit more salt. I ordered a medium, and it came out as more of a medium rare but it was still good.After we finished our meal and paid the check, we weren't finished with our drinks so we sat at the table for about 10 more minutes trying to finish our pitcher of margaritas (we brought tequila as our byob and they make the margaritas for you for an extra $10-12). One of the servers came up to us and asked us to finish our drinks at the bar because they needed to clear the table. She actually grabbed my boyfriends jacket off his chair and handed it to him as soon as he stood up. We felt really rushed out so we said we were just going to leave instead, but she seemed shocked that we weren't going to finish our drinks at the bar (as if there was any space at the bar with how small this place is). It was really unprofessional and didn't seem like a way you would treat your customers if you wanted them to return.All in all, the food is OK but the stress of going out to dinner and not having great service, and also being in an extremely small restaurant where the sound is much more amplified, it doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather spend 20 to 30 more dollars at the Cuban and have impeccable service and amazing food then give Zafra a fourth chance.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

It was really unprofessional and didn't seem like a way you would treat your customers if you wanted them to return.All in all, the food is OK but the stress of going out to dinner and not having great service, and also being in an extremely small restaurant where the sound is much more amplified, it doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather spend 20 to 30 more dollars at the Cuban and have impeccable service and amazing food then give Zafra a fourth chance.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

The other night, an old friend and I decided to go for a meal, wine, and catch up session. We started with maduros and the pork skewers. As much as I love maduros, these were not great. They were dry and flat, not plum and moist like I like. The pork was ok, but the cubed and fried yuca with hot paprika was delish. It served as a good starchy base for our bottle of wine. For an entree, I had the ropa vieja, which was out of control. The meat was so tender, it was like butter, a perfect topping for the salty rice and earthy black beans. My friend had chicken enchiladas, which were also extremely tasty. There was a lovely balance of mosit stringy chicken, tangy green sauce, and cooling crema. Both dishes were very delicious and well prepared. Simple but effective. Of course, we ordered dessert. I got the dulce de leche crepes, which were what dreams are made of. The two folded pancakes enveloped thick sweet caramel sauce and were coated with cinnamon sugar. To die for. My friend got the rice pudding that had an adult flair with a hint of anise and lots of creamy sweetness.

I end up taking half home with me. Brunch wouldn't be brunch without eggs, and a filling selection is their take on corned beef hash. It's not corned, but look for the Picadillo Jinetero on the menu.The restaurant is BYOB and for $10 per 750ml red or white wine bottle, they'll make you a decent sangria.

I knew I was in Joisey when I was crossin' Hudson Street here in Hoboken, and an old woman was walkin' really slow with her walker. So I says to her, ""You got a license for that?"" to which she gave me the finguh. Oh come on, you know me. I would never say such a thing, but Jamie W. and I witnessed such an episode on our way to Zafra Kitchen. Now we only knew about this Cuban place from our friends Jeremy and Nerissa who raved about it since they're Joisey natives happily transplanted to San Francisco. Since the ferry was incredibly easy to take from Battery Park, well, here we were. It's a few blocks into Hoboken right across from the university medical center.This compact place is bustling even at 2:30PM when we showed up. Lots of regulars with tables crowded together (photo: bit.ly/11qXbX9) and a really robust menu (photo: bit.ly/19bZ1QW). We were still recovering from our Italian breakfast at Locanda Verde, but in quick order, the complimentary bread basket came with toasted, buttered wedges of Cuban bread (photo: bit.ly/12AO77h). Quite addicting right off the bat. Speaking of bats, did you know Hoboken is the birthplace of baseball? There, you learned something before I tell you about our shared appetizer, the $5 Quesadilla de Hongos, quite a saucy-cheesy concoction that looked more like a tamale since it's a corn masa turnover (photo: bit.ly/169i5xw).Delicious and filled with mushrooms, jalapeño peppers and fresh cheese and covered with a spicy green salsa. This is an authentic quesadilla according to Cuban chef Maricel Presilla who would know since she just won the James Beard Award for Cookbook of the Year for her expertise in Latin cuisine. From there, we went with the sandwiches, and they were melty-savory good rib-stickers. Jamie had the classic $5 Cubano with roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese and pickle slices pressed together between two slices of Cuban bread, all toasted lightly (photo: bit.ly/169idNe). As good as that one was, I think I had the winner with the $6 Pan con Lechón.It was a hot sandwich with shards of roast pork, Cuban mojo sauce, and grilled onions, kinda like a Habanero's version of a patty melt (photo: bit.ly/1aiqa65). Both our sandwiches came with long plantain chips, crispy-crunchy with a hint of tropical sweetness that worked well with the earthy flavors. We liked it and will definitely come back when we have larger appetites. There's a great casual vibe, and the prices are obviously quite reasonable. But the New York Waterway Ferry beckons as we didn't allot much Joisey time that day. Maybe I let Bugs Bunny shape my opinion of Hoboken too much. After all, when he found out the saucer-eyed Playboy Penguin was from there after taking him all the way to the South Pole, he shouted, ""HOBOKEN??!!!...Ohhhh, I'm dyin'!!""FOOD - 4 stars...authentic Cuban food, well turned with big, bold flavorsAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...homey if a bit crowded, but Havana is like that, too, isn't it?SERVICE - 4 stars...she works hard for the money, so hard for it, honeyTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely worth the quick ferry ride over from Battery Park if you're hankering for a Cubano",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

It was so tight that my husband turned the light switch off with his back by mistake and a waiter ran over rudely yelling ""don't touch that!!!"".  We were finally seated at a table right by the bathroom and it smelled really awful! We requested to be moved to another open table but they refused and yelled at us again saying that the open table was for 5 people not 4! So after waiting over an hour of which 25 min after they had us waste our drinks and run back to wait by their front door they were completely unaccommodating and rude.

For the mains, I've had a few of the shrimp dishes, and while they are all different on the menu, they all kinda taste the same to me (don't read into that the wrong way - they are all good). The roast pork they have, I'm convinced there is a whole roasted pig in the back they are cutting slabs off of. You get a huge portion of meat here, easily enough for 2 meals.

The outside seating is nice, though a bit cramped.  I didn't go inside, so I am not able to comment on the cleanliness or atmosphere of the dining room.The staff are pleasant, but significantly less than attentive.  Getting water glasses refilled, getting our check, receiving our change back, all required some creative gesticulating and borderline unreasonable amounts of waiting.  Many of the staff seemed to congregate too easily at the hostess station rather than checking on their guests.  The food is primarily tapas, though there are also some entrees and a few sides and salads.  The food is okay, but not spectacular.  Here's a rundown of a few of the fall downs...The Albondiguitas (meatballs) were served in a sauce overpowered with clove.The Papa Rellena (mashed potato ball) seemed to have the same filling as the Empanadillas.The Pinchos Morunos (skewered pork ""morsels"") were a pair of of satay looking things, very tough and over-cooked, with cubed potatoes cooked rock hard and dowsed with spicy mayonnaise.The tostones were chalky and rather bland.Perhaps it was simply an off night for the kitchen (7 pm on a Saturday), or perhaps the chef is more concerned with having an entire page of accolades and bona fides splashed on the website to peddle her cookbooks and plug her cocoa bean import business.  I'll let others decide.  But after all the build up from the website about the authentic of the food and the doctorate level expertise of each ingredient and the culture from whence it comes, it was disappointing.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

Then again, it was a gorgeous night (one of those early fall evenings with comfortable temperatures and fresh air), and a large crowd of people were waiting to sit outside to eat, so maybe we shouldn't have been surprised. Anyway...We've been here before, usually for brunch, although we ate dinner here once about two years ago. Unfortunately, we keep forgetting to bring liquor so we can try some of the mixed drinks. Inexcusable. Forgive me, Yelpers. I decided to pick something from the non-alcoholic side of the menu and chose the Chicha Morada (purple corn fruit punch) while my boyfriend decided to get the Horchata de Almendra Alicantina (iced cinnamon drink...tasted more like iced chai to me, but was good). My fruit punch was less fruit and more corn, but it had a nice sweet flavor and it didn't leave an aftertaste (although it did leave a nice purple ring around the inside of my mouth).We split two small dishes: the Papa Rellena (a mashed potato ball filled with beef hash and a spicy relish) and the Croqueticas de Jamon (ham croquettes served with salsa). The only thing that bothered me about the Croqueticas was their size...we were served four of them, but they were awfully small and we went through them in seconds. Delicious, but not nearly enough. Maybe we should have ordered two servings.For our main courses, I had the Enchiladas de Pollo (enchiladas stuffed with chicken and served with refried beans in a cream sauce), which was delicious, but very filling. I had to order a cup of Oolong tea to settle my stomach afterwards. I think I ate everything a bit too quickly, truth be told. The tomatillo sauce covering the enchiladas was a perfect blend of sweet and tangy, and the chicken meat was extremely tender. My boyfriend ordered the Anticuchos Pinchos de Pollo Peruanos, which was skewered pieces of marinated chicken, served with white beans, a baked sweet potato, and rice. I sampled some of his chicken and loved it. The rice had a wonderful texture to it; it wasn't dry or hard, but cooked and fluffed just so.We wanted to split flan for dessert, but our waiter told us they ran out (booo!). So we contented ourselves with sipping our tea and espresso until the check was served.If you decide to come here, be prepared for some noise.

Especially for their prices and tiny portions.I came here for a friend's birthday with about 7 other people and thought this was going to be the best night of our lives because we actually found parking in Hoboken in less than 20 minutes!  In true Latino fashion, we arrived late to our friend's reservation about 15 minutes and were rudely greeted at the obnoxiously small host area.  They needed to physically confirm that our entire party was present to sit  us, at the table that was clearly being held for our apparently giant party.Our table consisted of about 4 two seat tables and a mixture of foldable chairs and ugly wooden ones. The tables around us were so close they had to get up in order to let us sit, pee and most important we nearly lost important drops of sangria due to this closeness.The plates were decent sizes, but not for the prices. I understand it's Hoboken and they are catering to the wealthy wallets, but literally 2 miles away they serve you double the amount and half the price in North Bergen or Union City.  I ordered the beef on a stick and patatas bravas, which both had great flavor. The beef kebabs were veryyyy thin slices and if I hadn't had 8 glasses of sangria, I would've been starved. We were rushed out at the end of our meal, despite having spent a decent amount of money and enduring crappy seating conditions.

113,8NTpnZjz92JsW0bn3RJG5Q,Keila B.,3.0 star rating,"I went to Zafra on a late Sunday afternoon for an early dinner...around 5pm. There were three of us and we had our pick of tables and chose to sit inside. The menu has many different dishes from all over Latin America. It seemed like pretty much every country or region was represented and you don't always see that. The menu was very extensive. Only one person in our party ordered an appetizer: a chicken tamale but we all tried it. It was very good. For my entree I had the picadillo which is a ground beef dish made with olives, raisins, onions, garlic, etc. I'm Dominican and picadillo is a standard dish (I make a really good version). It was served with a mound of rice and three sweet plantains. I thought that was a bit stingy, but sweet, fried plantains are one of my favorite things to eat. Anyway, the picadillo was ok. It was very flavorful but also a bit salty. The raisins add a sweetness that complements the savory aspect but there also seemed to be an additional sweetness that I couldn't quite place and didn't thoroughly enjoy. It did not keep me from eating most of it though. My mister had the Cerdo Brujo con Yuca and I only tried a small portion and I found it lacking that savory, fatty porky goodness that pork usually has. I'm used to pork being prepared as pernil and this wasn't quite that. The yuca however was very well prepared. If not done properly it can be chalky and dry and this was nice and tender. My friend had the Ropa Vieja. I tried a little and it was not bad. Flavor was ok albeit a little under seasoned. Overall the meal wasn't bad. I don't go to Hoboken very often (we were there to drop our friend off) so I don't know if I would be back bc there are so many other places to try. However, I do recommend if you are looking for some decent Pan-Latin cuisine.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"
114,YsgpVTXqh5PCz2VIdLGJjw,Michcella T.,3.0 star rating,"I've passed by Zafra's on several occasions, and am always amazed at how packed the outdoor area is. Seriously - it takes dedication for anyone to WILLINGLY sit outside on Willow Avenue for their food. My compadre happened to have a gift card to this place - not to mention she gave up chain restaurants for Lent - so I happily agreed to try it. And she prefaced that they'd make you sangria in exchange for your own bottle of wine. Sign me up.I had a good experience at Zafra, but not amazing and unforgettable. I see some of these reviews on here that make Zafra out to be way more upscale and unique than it really is. If you're not originally from Hudson county, I can see why you would think this place is so. But if you're a true resident of Hudson County, don't be fooled. Really.We were two, and our wait was originally 40 minutes. There was maybe two or three other parties waiting, and every single table was jam-packed. Fortunately, the wait wasn't that long at all. While walking to a local liquor store to pick up wine, we got the call that our table was ready. I realize now why our wait was much shorter, but I'll explain that later.The place itself, as you may have read, is smaller than small. It's decorated with lush, colorful icons of Latino culture. It's like your Abuelita invited you and your entire family over, and now you're all cramped in her  living room eating dinner (sans the soaps on TV).We were seated at the bar, which I didn't mind.I noticed we didn't get any bread, which annoyed me. The couple next to us and everyone else got bread. In fact, our service was shotty all night. Different waiters and waitresses took our order, brought us drinks, etc. It feels a little awkward when four people are serving you. But I guess that just goes along with the laid-back vibe of the place.Scanning the menu, you'll notice lots of different Latino inspired dishes. At first, I thought the prices weren't too bad for Hoboken. 5 and 6 bucks for tapas is pretty standard, and 21 bucks for an entree is alright. But remember how I said the place was small? Fittingly, the portions are JUST AS SMALL. I was completely underwhelmed by the food placed in front of us. I get that 'empanadillas' mean that they'll be smaller, but they were completely miniscule. And you only got two of them. My friend's Ropa Vieja was served in a tiny cup - yes, a cup. You can easily go to Union City and get the same type of food, triple times the portions, all of the same quality and taste, for a fraction of the price. Abuelita would be ashamed. I can get over the price for the taste - and I did leave full after making a meal of three tapas - but I'm still shocked over what I received for the amount of money I paid.Then, after we ordered dessert, we were asked to leave. Yep, leave. Two sips into my Venezuelan hot chocolate (which was excellent), one of our many waiters came over and said, and I quote, ""Ladies, could you please pay? There are lots of other parties waiting."" She was polite about it, but come on, we weren't even there an hour. Now I KNOW you just want our money and then you want us to leave. (Now can you see why OUR wait time was a lot shorter?)If you're gonna go there, be prepared to cough up all your cash for tiny, but tasty portions. Don't expect any sort of good service, and I'm sure they just don't care. It's nice that they make you sangria.Try the yuca fries and the authentic quesidilla - both of which were memorably delicious.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

The dish was just about perfect, although when asked how I wanted my steak done I asked for it medium and it was close to well-done. A skirt steak is thin and hard to get right. They should stop asking how you want your steak done to lower expectations. Besides that, my meal was fabulous. The black beans were the highlight, mixed with the rice and hot sauce; YUM.

I had the vegetarian platter, which although the options for vegetarians may be lacking, the platter was delicious. Fresh kale, wonderfully flavored black beans and rice, and a few other small sides.

At Zafra, you are lucky enough to try food from many other countries beside these two. On the menu you can pick a Venezuelan steak, sandwich, Ecuadorian potato appetizers, etc.  It is truly a unique experience in a beautiful, colorful room.The food however is mediocre at best. Over the past 10 years I've eaten at Zafra and I really haven't been impressed. I really want to love it but on several occasions the food has been cold. The biggest problem with the food in general is the under- seasoning, nothing seems to have enough salt or pepper. I don't know if the Chef is afraid of scaring off people with weak palates. The Oaxacan Mole I had was flavorful but still just needed more salt. And while it was great that it was chicken breast (for health reasons), it would have been soooo much better if it was made with dark meat like I've had in Mexico City and Oaxaca.A crime against humanity was the churrasco. While basically cooked correctly (medium rare), it lacked salt and pepper thus rendering a very weak crispy crust. The chimichuri sauce was AWFUL. It was mostly oil with hints of cilantro and a complete failure of acid of any type.While I agree some things on the menu are definitely worth trying (Venezuelan Steak Sandwich, fried yucca fries). I am always disappointed by them and do wish they would do better.OH! And make sure you check your bills because the waiter added the tip the check without telling us when we were only 4 adults and 1 child.

I've been here maybe 10 times or so, and can say that I have never been let down by the food. It's also one of those places where I can come and never order the same thing, which is rare for me. The yuca fries and cilantro sauce are at the top of my all-time favorite apps list, and there are two chicken dishes here that are great (one is served on a skewer with a side of sweet potatoes and white beans, the other is grilled with a side of pumpkin) and the roasted pork is also excellent. Zafra is BYOB.The bad (but could be so much worse, which just means plan accordingly): It's small. I don't know if I've ever sat comfortably here. They also don't take reservations unless you are a group of 6 or more. If you have fewer than that, plan for a lengthy wait on the weekends, or try to sit at the bar if you can get a spot. I would also recommend double or triple checking your reservation if you need to make one. I made one for a group of 8 a few years ago, and they put down the wrong time, so we had to go somewhere else. When you are dining here, they will put you on a fairly strict time limit to turn tables/make sure reservations can be seated on time. I don't necessarily have a problem with this, but don't expect to sit around leisurely after your meal if people are waiting. Your best bet if you want to avoid any of the things I mentioned is to go on an off night/weeknight.Zafra is definitely one of the best spots in town, but if you know what you're in for and can plan ahead, you're in for a great meal!",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

Zafra has a much more laid-back, family-style feel. The menu is just as authentic and delicious, but had a more home-cooked touch as compared to Cucharamama's more sophisticated menu. The BYOB is also a perk since I'm one to save a dollar or two and would rather choose my own wine to pair with the evenings dishes. We ordered the croquetas jamon, of course, and they were good but definitely not the best. The exterior crunch was perfect, but the inside lacked the saltiness and creaminess I was looking for. The Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos de Frijol Refrito y Tres Quesos were incredible. The texture, flavors, everything about them blended well I just wish that for $9 you were given more than two small peppers.For entrees I ordered the Camarones Coloraditos which came with a kale salad and I have to say that this kale salad was one of the most delicious sides I have had in a very long time. The orange cut through with a perfect citrus note while the garlic kept it savory... incredible. The shrimp in the mole sauce was divine, however since it's served on a corn polenta, i thought the white rice on the plate to be unnecessary. My date had the Pollo con Mole Oaxaqueno... his mole had a bit more spice to it than mine but the chicken was cooked perfectly.

153,9-9cJ8yHp5zZ-u2o2Z19tQ,Crystine W.,1.0 star rating,"My experience with Zafra's has left me with great distaste and disgust towards this restaurant.  I will never again visit this establishment (nor their sister restaurant CucharaMama up the street) because I do not support dishonesty.  As a Yelper, I of course feel compelled to report the full incident of what I experienced and I hope it does make you reconsider giving your money to this restaurant.  I had 9PM reservations (that were made by phone) and they called to confirm the reservations the day of (about 3 hours prior).  We arrived by 9PM, but we did not get seated until 9:45PM.  Don't agree to take my party for a 9PM slot if you are unable to provide the accommodations, this is just unprofessional because this restaurant is quite small and it does not have a 15-person waiting area so we were forced to stand outside in the bitter cold for 45 minutes.  I was ready to excuse this because the food actually turned out to be quite good (and I was ready to post a 4-star review and just note to other prospective customers to be careful about their appointment times), but then the bullsh[i]t that followed is completely inexcusable.  In short, one of their waiters pocketed $20 of our money and then turned on us saying that we did not give him enough money.  Here is the scenario as follows:1.  We received the bill (which totaled around $336) and after collecting ""dues"" from the entire party, we had a sum of $289 in cash and instructed the server to put the rest on the credit card (which should have been around $40 to $45).  Now note ... prior to us giving him the cash, we had THREE of our table guests counting the cash to ensure they received the same total (and I also want to add that one of them is a Math major at NYU so we know our numbers were correct).2. The server comes back to us with the credit card receipt and it is $20 more than what we were expecting to sign for so we brought this point up to him.  He stated that 20% was gratuity (which was $57), which meant that it was supposed to be $232 that they held in cash, but he argued that there was only $212 in the cash.  3. He then brings the hostess/register lady to confirm that he only gave her $212 in cash after taking out the $57 for gratuity.  She confirms that this is true.  (I don't think she is lying because at this point, he would've already taken out the $20).  4. After 10-15 minutes of disagreement, we reluctantly signed for the amount that was $20 more than expected (this was a special occasion night and we really did not want to give any more attention and time to this issue than was already given), but we did note to them that we were not in agreement with the events that occurred.  5. The next day, we call the restaurant asking to speak to the manager.  After much explaining and clarification, he told us that he would be crediting our credit card back the $20.  Dear Zafra's owner: Thank you for crediting us back our $20, but note that this was NOT a coincidence nor a misunderstanding.  You have a disloyal and cunning rat on your staff and it is imperative that you make note of this situation or else it could happen to another customer.  And now to you, Mr. Waiter who took the $20 - I hope you suck on that bill and enjoy it real good because karma does exist.  And when karma catches up to you, it'll cost you a lot more than $$$ taken from customers.  Your dishonesty and act is disgusting.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

They won't tell anyone, and the people you are with won't even notice because their glasses will be overflowing with delicious fruit.The food is fantastic here. I could eat every appetizer on the menu, and be happy. However that wouldn't leave room for the number one reason my wife and I come here....Churrasco con Chimichurri.

So we ordered some drinks and noticed another table getting up so we asked to be moved.

Usually, this markup is justified by the service of the restaurant (if I wanted to eat cheap food, I'd just buy it at the supermarket and prepare it myself at home).Zafra, however, seemed to miss this very basic tenet of the food industry. I showed up here on a Wed night with my girlfriend. We requested to sit outside since it was warm, but the waiter, after originally agreeing, told us that we could not sit outside because they stop seating outside at 10pm. It was 915pm when we got there.Fair enough, we came inside and found a half empty establishment, with several parties about to leave. We sat and decided to order the Yuca Croquettes with Cilantro sauce as an appetizer, and then one sandwich for each of us. As we ordered, we were told that they had no more sandwiches because they ""ran out of bread"". I've never owned a restaurant but if I did, I would probably try and not run out of bread. I gave them a pass and decided to browse through the menu some more.Now, the sandwiches were not cheap. My Pan con Bistec would have cost $10, and my girlfriend's chicken sandwich ran for $8. The next items up on the menu all were in the $15-17 range, for very basic Cuban and South American dishes. Disappointed, we decided to just eat the $6 Yuca croquettes. For our troubles, we received exactly 4 Yuca croquettes, each about 1 inch in diameter, dipped in a red sauce. 4 Yucas at a price of about $1.50 each.To top it off, we had to wait about 15 minutes before they finally came to give us our check, even though we were one of only 3 parties in the entire restaurant.Thanks, but no thanks - if I want good Latino cuisine I'll make the trek up to Bergenline Ave.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

We always make a reservation day of, sometimes just a few hours in advance which works out better bc it's not huge and gets pretty packed quickly. They will make sangria for you with wine you bring in for $10. We get a few pitchers of it bc the fresh fruit is tasty and not too sugary. I've had a few of the appetizers from the papa relleno, yuca croquettes, quesadillas etc ad they're all pretty good and run about $5-6 a plate. I would recommend for entrees the steak they offer. You can split it amongst two if you get a side of black beans and rice and it's more than enough food. They have this cilantro dressing for the steak that tastes very fresh and adds a little tang to the dish! All in all it's a good place. I usually spend in total $20 if we split the check and that includes the sangria. The downsides would be the small space and sometimes they rush you out so they can seat people which is understandable. However, if you automatically add gratuity to your checks then I think it's pretty rude to rush out a table that still has a few pitchers to drink.   Its hit or miss. Sometimes I've seen them rush people and sometimes they don't.

We were told it would be a 10 minute wait and to our surprise it actually was. They have a tiny bar area where we sat and waiting and since it is BYOB we had a glass of wine. Side note- the place is really small & they cramp tables in, if you go, go in expecting that. Also, since it is BYOB you can bring wine and they will make you Sangria which is delightful. Once our table was ready we sat down at a cramped table by the door. We felt extremely uncomfortable and asked the waitress if we could move to a different table, they were extremely accommodating so we did!Before I comment on the food I would like to say the service was great. Our order was taken quick, our food came out fast and how we wanted it and we left within an hour and a half. Now for the food, it is a cross between Cuban and Latin American so it has a great variety of different areas. We started with the empanadillas (which you may also know as empanadas) They were two miny beef picadillo empanadillas served with a marvelous chimichurri sauce. If there is one thing I love, its Chimichurri! We also had the papa rellena which was served with pickled onions and was on point! The appetizers were super authentic so I was expecting a wonderful entree. Boy did Zafra deliver. Everyone at the table had the skirt steak which I had a taste of and was delicious. It was cooked the way everyone wanted, was tender and a great portion, & came with a side of chimichurri and white rice and black beans. Again very authentic and tasty. I decided to have the pork (cerdo assado). I have to say this is the most authentic roasted pork I have had outside of home cooking. It was perfectly flavored with garlic and other seasonings. It came with broiled yuca in garlic mojo and a side of rice and you could pick another side dish,which I chose madurros (sweet plaintains) Again I cant express how authentic and delicious everything was. It all tasted like wonderful home cooking. We didn't have dessert or coffee since we were stuffed so I can't speak on those but everything else was great!I thought the food was priced on point with its quality and location being Hoboken. Its not as cheap as it would be in another location and slightly higher priced because it is BYOB but nothing out of the Hoboken norm.

The food was good, although I caught myself comparing it to La Isla throughout the meal since that's my ultimate favorite restaurant (and Cuban place) in Hoboken! We got an assortment of things to try -- yuca fries, potato ball, sweet plantains, tamales, steak sandwich. The yuca fries were my favorite, cooked perfect with a delicious dipping sauce! Sweet plantains were good as well, although different than what I expected (not caramelized and ]sweet like La Isla). The potato ball and tamales were pretty dry so I wasn't a big fan, and the steak sandwich was good (although the sandwich at Flamboyan - a hole in the wall Spanish place down the street - is better).The atmosphere was okay, although it got really loud once the dinner rush hit so I would probably go a little earlier next time, or maybe on a week night. The one thing I really did not like was that I felt rushed. At one point, the waitress asked me if I was done twice within two minutes.Giving this place 2 stars, although i would give 2 1/2 if I could.

It looked REALLY good, will definitely be bringing a bottle of wine next time.I had the shrimp and red mole--it was a little on the sweet side, but I LOVED it. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mole was incredibly flavorful and had a great texture. It came over polenta which was excellent for soaking up the sauce, perfectly cooked/seasoned rice, sauteed kale and black beans (the black beans were surprisingly weak, definitely a low point). I would get this again without a second thought. The other person got the chicken in mole sauce. This was also good, but didn't hold a candle to the shrimp dish.

It was Hoboken 2.0-- which was a big deal for me since my first visit was so mentally scarring (and that was 4 years ago and I haven't been back since). New year, New decade, why not give Hoboken a fresh start? And that I did. We were to meet at Zafra at 7:30pm on a Friday eve, luckily since Stephfloat is on top of her game, she called a head and made a reservation-- boy, am I glad she did. When we got there, a group of four just walked outside and mentioned there was a 45 minute wait. Phew, we really dodged a bullet. Anyway, as mentioned in Stephfloat's review, our friend was extremely tardy.. and hour and a half late to be exact. So in order to not marinate in all the Sangria we were consuming (BYOB then $10 bucks per pitcher of Sangria-- they provide the juice and fruit) we ordered some appetizers. We started off with the albondiguitas de carne which are cuban style meatballs in a delectable sauce. I could have eaten an entire meal of these-- granted they would have had to made a larger plate of them in order for it to suffice as a meal. Then we dabbled in the patatas bravas. Another sauce of the spicier variety *not too spicy at all for all you wimps out there* that just blew me away. Whomever is in charge of sauces here, pat yourself on the back hombre- good work! Lastly as our third app, we got the chorizo encebollado which is sausage with onions and green olives. The sausage was extremely flavorful and the olives and onions complemented it well. After realizing our friend was now on the verge of being shamelessly late, we gave ourselves the green light to go ahead and order our entrees (sorry pals, but an over an hour and a half late for dinner-- we're not waiting any longer). I ordered the Churrasco con chimichurri. Not the best Argentinean style skirt steak I've ever had, but still mouth watering. My fave was the ropa vieja which is Cuban style shredded beef in a (yet another) delicious sauce.

I'm always on the lookout for vegetarian dishes now, and I was very happy that we didn't have to ask them to whip something together like many restaurants do.

Delicious!As I said, the place is BYOB which we didn't know before arriving. So my companion ran out to get a bottle of wine at the store 2 blocks down.

While the menu is pretty standard Cuba fare (at least for the area), there are plenty of options.  Of course, we had a pitcher of sangria.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely enjoyable.  We started with some Yuca fries for the table. Absolutely love the cilantro sauce they pair with them.  Always worth it!  For dinner, my fiance and one of our friends both ordered the Anticuchos--Pinchos de Pollo Peruanos (grilled chicken skewers).  I did try some, and they were a little more dry than they've been in the past, but still plenty flavorful.  Our other friend ordered Camarones de Papantla (shrimp with a chipotle vanilla sauce).  While I didn't try it, she didn't have any leftovers, so I think she liked!  I had the Camarones Coloraditos (shrimp with mole sauce).  The only note I'd offer Zafra's on this, is that it seemed like the shrimp was simply tossed with the mole, rather than being marinated & cooked completely in it.  I did enjoy it, but it would have been better if the ingredients were a little more integrated.All that said, my favorite dish there is still the skirt steak.  I know, I can also make the same thing at home (and I have, and it's good), but that doesn't mean I won't order it on a night that I am out for dinner.  There is a reason you go out for dinner.  So just because you can make it yourself, don't be upset that you have to pay for it.Looks like a couple reviewers weren't satisfied with the amount of food, but I'd disagree completely.  None of us ordered dessert.  Maybe a little pricey, but not compared to other Hoboken restaurants.  The restaurant space is fine.  It's a small space, and they make the most of it.  Cramped yes, but so are tons & tons of other places in & around the city.  Get over it.All in all, we'll be back, of course.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

224,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"One of my college friends recently moved into my neighborhood, but at the other side of town.  We planned to meet up for dinner, and, since it was a nice warm summer evening, I decided it would be the perfect occasion to try a new restaurant in her neck of the woods.  While I had been to the James Beard nominated Cucharamama around the corner, I had yet to sample the chef's other restaurant, Zafra.   Zafra is many things that Cucharamama is not; the spot is a more traditional Latin style, while Cucharamama is more Nuevo South American.  Zafra refrained from acquiring a liquor license like its sister spot, but they are more than happy to craft a pitcher of sweet sangria from whatever bottle of wine you tote along with you.  Also, if like us you were unaware of this delicious option, your server will run over to Cucharamama and pick up a white or red bottle of your choice.  My friend and I opted for a white and were indulged by some of the most crisp, light, and fruity sangria ever.  I also must warn you that Zafra only possesses about 5 indoor and 5 outdoor tables, which usually results in a substantial wait time.  Enough with all of the pointers - Let us discuss what makes Zafra worth the wait...the fantastic food!  Our meal began with some crisp, Latin-spiced bread, which satisfied us until our meals arrived.  My Anticuchos--Pinchos de Pollo Peruanos dinner was a beautiful platter centered around Grilled Chicken Skewers.  Each long stick was standing at an acute angle, the bunch forming a little tent.  The tender chunks of meat were marinated in a savory Peruvian sauce that had a slight spice to it.  The dish was completed by half of a baked sweet potato, a mound of white rice, and a bowl of cooked white beans.  The meal was extremely hearty, while still being well-balanced and on the healthier side.  My friend ordered the Argentinean-Style Skirt Steak, which was nicely cooked and topped with an oily Chimichurri Sauce.  She thoroughly enjoyed it, which I still favored my chicken.  However, we both enjoyed Zafra better than its sister restaurant.This downtown Hoboken dining establishment serves up elegantly presented Latin meals in a comforting, home-style café away from the bustle of Washington Street.  As long as you are prepared for a possible table line, Zafra is the perfect option for a quiet dinner.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

That being said:Zafra is a pretty good cuban restaurant. We had an order of plaintains and salsa which was surprisingly good because the plaintains were cut vertically (rather than horizontal discs like most places) and the salsa had a perfect bite. I only wish the heat was present in more dishes, although I understand cuban food is not traditionally spicey.Pork morsels on skewers and cuban version of empanadas were standard, if not just above. The bread bowl was surprisingly good; it was the type  of bread used for cuban sandwiches, much thinner with soft interior, crispy outside with a touch of butter, very good.We had two camarones dishes - one with mole, one in spicy sauce - and both were good. The greedy part of me would have like an additional shrimp or two, especially for $20 when you only get 6 shrimp and some rice and beans.Its byob which is great, but the policy explains why there's typically an hour wait for dinner service.

You really can't get much better food at a BYOB place, and the best part is that they'll make cocktails for you if you bring the write ingredients. They'll whip pitchers of sangria, margaritas, and a bunch of other drinks and they taste great. I've always had terrific service here and the wait staff is usually a lot of fun. The one downside to this place is that its really small and you'll most likely have to wait for a table, especially on a weekend night.

My bf's cousin's brother loves this place so we tried it out on a recent visit to nearby NYC. It was pouring miserable buckets of rain outside so a quick shelter was mostly what I was thinking of.  It was small corner place, cozy inside. Long bar along the right, small tableclothed tables on the left. It had a nice feel with fresh fruit on display on the bar. Apparently this place doesn't have a liquor license. This is all new to me, since this doesn't ever happen in CA. They have an interesting drink menu including Mojitos, but then, it's a virgin drink unless you know beforehand that you have to bring your own alcohol. There are a lot of fruit drinks though if you want your sugar fix. I got an iced tea - it was minty flavored and a green tea, so I wasn't a fan. It was also puny, non-refillable, and $4!!! Do not order it! They start you off with complementary warmed bread. Kind of just like a buttered pita though.The empanadillas were tasty. The minty spicy dipping sauce was good. One of us got the Chicken Tortilla soup- it was perfect since it was humid, 80, but raining. LOL. That was good too. Simple but fresh. The main entrees were not as good and were totally overpriced. One of us got the skirt steak, one got the pork adobo, and I got the chicken dish whose name escapes me. Can't find a menu online, sorry. The waitress warned me that the chicken dish was really plain. And it was. I'd rather not have opened my mouth and wasted the calories. The pork was also flavorless. The steak was boring.

Delish!!!The yucca fries was made exacly how I like it - crunchy.  But the cilantro sauce was the best.  Who knew that combination would work.  I went back the following week.  I tasted the Venezuelan style sandwich.  That has got to be the best steak sandwich I ever tasted.  It's shredded steak with onions - not sure what spices were in it but it was so tasty!!!",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

Although our Yuca croquettes were great, the menu was unimpressive and the food I ordered was bland.2. My rice, which looked like it was put on my plate by Lunch Lady Doris with an ice cream scooper, was also rife with hair.  Looks like Doris wasn't wearing her hairnet. Gross.3. The place is BYOB, but we weren't aware of this until we had already sat down.  I obviously can't get through anything without alcohol (especially a meal) so this is a problem for me.  Thanks for nothing, New Jersey.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

271,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,4.0 star rating,"Sometimes it can be easy to forget that there are so many great restaurants in this little town. We get stuck going time and time again to our favorites like Gio's or Q-Dubs, and we fail to explore the variety of cuisines that Hoboken have to offer. As the weather gets better in Hoboken, it will hopefully encourage you to venture past the usual Washington Street offerings and explore all the hidden gems in Hoboken. It is a small restaurant on the corner of 3rd and Willow. It looks so much like it was taken straight out of Cuba and transplanted here in the states that I was worried that INS would come in at any moment and send it back. The restaurant was as bright and vibrant, which was very reflective of the culture. The wait staff seemed very relaxed; however, if you combine that with a small restaurant with lots of customers, I could see you waiting for a table and service to be a problem. As this was my first time trying Cuban food, I went off of the recommendations of our waitress even though everything on the menu sounded delicious. For an appetizer, we ordered the Papa Rellena, which is a Cuban-style mashed potato ball filled with beef hash and an ecuadorian Ají relish. The potato was cooked perfectly, and served piping hot. For our main courses, my guest ordered Anticuchos Pinchos de Pollo Peruanos, which are grilled skewered chicken morsels marinated Peruvian style, served with a baked sweet potato, rice and white beans. I had a Ropa Vieja, which is a classic Cuban that consisted of shredded beef braised in a wine sauce, also served with white rice and black beans. Both dishes were cooked wonderfully, seasoned perfectly, and served beautifully. The portions were on the smaller side, but definitely filled me up perfectly. We also shared a side order of Tostones, which are crunchy golden fried green plantain rounds and a garlic mojo dipping sauce. The plaintains were crunchy and delicious, and the garlic sauce was unexpectedly delicious. My guest and I also decided to splurge with some smoothies that were good, but not stellar.  Although it is a bit of a trek to get down to Zafra, it is worth the walk. There are so many restaurants tucked away in the innards of Hoboken, and once in a while you can find a real gem to come back to. While I complained every step of the way to my guest, I can say I didn't have anything to complain about with the actual meal. But if you really can't stand the walk then the next time that you need to take the unfortunate trip down to the Hoboken University Medical Center, stop by Zafra.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"

273,UE3oAFUe2lPiqIAnDFg-Cg,J Y.,2.0 star rating,"This review is a reminder to pay close attention to the check!!!!The food was decent. Comparable to other latin-cuban restaurants in the area but unfortunately they seem to count on the fact that their customers will not review their check correctly. The first issue we encountered was that the website claims they take reservations but this is not the case on  saturday night, unless you have 6 people. No big deal though. We had 5, and when we arrived we were squeezed in to a table that is suitable for 4 people, despite the fact that two other tables were available that could seat up to 6. They very reluctantly moved us, but after that we enjoyed a nice meal. Things went downhill very quickly when we received our bill. We got it, then gave our credit card, and then the bill was returned to us so we could sign. Then we noticed the amount that was on the bill was different to what the bill initially said, but we couldn't check it because the itemized receipt was ""missing."" We quickly realized that they charged us 20% gratuity and didn't inform us. I asked the waiter why this was done, given that auto-gratuity was only added when its a party of 6 or more, (according to their website) to which they said that it was a Saturday night, so its added to 5 people or more. (how convenient) So not only did they not inform us, but they also hoped we wouldn't notice by removing the itemized receipt. Furthermore, they added the tip on to the AFTER-TAX amount! Is that even legal? On top of that, the bill then stated there was a PRE-TIP area on the reciept so they were trying to get us to tip ON TOP OF the 20% tip that they had forgotten to mention.The only reason i gave it two stars was because its BYOB and the food was fine.Unfortunately, i will not be returning to this place, simply because if you are not careful you can be duped into paying more than you should. It was obvious it wasn't a mistake, and that they were hoping to trick us. It left a very bad taste in our mouths and had they not done this, we would've tipped 20% anyway! I would not recommend this place simply due to their shady practices.",Zafra Kitchen,3.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Tapas, Bars,, Cuban"
