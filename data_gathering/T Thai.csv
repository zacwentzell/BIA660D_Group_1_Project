The restaurant is very clean and intimate.I'm a big fan of their Thai Iced T ($3) and I always order the vegetarian duck with spicy noodle $12 and the cheese puff appetizer which costs around  $5.00 for two pieces of flaky on the inside but creamy surprise on the inside of hot melted cheese.  They accept credit card/cash and they do deliveries and are quite fast. Minimum order of $10.00 is required for deliveryThey have outdoor seating when the weather is nice and it's also BYOB.  It's a great ambiance, really no frills but worth checking out their food. If you're lucky they have this blue crab fried rice which is one of their specials which is delicious and you can tell them how spicy you want on their dishes.I don't think they use MSG since I don't get tired after a hearty meal.

1,ZPCiIJZYjNHzlvOrMAVqbA,Hailey K.,1.0 star rating,Is it impossible to find a decent Thai restaurant in Jersey City/Hoboken?! Decided to order delivery tonight at T Thai. Much to my surprised when I opened the containers the Tofu with basil sauce was just 4 huge chunks of cold tofu in the dish!!! The chicken pad thai barely any chicken in it and the chicken wings were over fried and dry. Ugh I can deal with subpar pad thai and over cooked wings but the COLD chunks of soft tofu in the dish was so disgusting.

3,T9xLOjbWITOK0DiEdCOyTw,Laura E.,5.0 star rating,"Best chicken pad thai I've ever had! I prefer pad thai that's more on the sour-sweet side, and this does the job perfectly. It's conveniently located a few blocks away from the Hoboken PATH station. If you get the pad thai as their lunch special, which is $8 before 4:00, it also comes with an appetizer of salad and spring roll, which are lackluster compared to the main dish. The noodles of the pad thai are slightly al dente but still chewy, and they mix the bean sprout, green onion, carrot and peanuts with the noodles. The portion is really large, and can be split into two meals. They take card, and split it amongst our party of 4. I always come back whenever I'm feeling down and need to indulge a plate of heavy noodles.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

Thai is pretty good overall.  I did think that their Green Curry was genuinely very good - I asked for extra spicy and it came with decent heat.  The Pad See Ew was very good as well - more vegetables than other places - and the noodles were soft and chewy.  The Pad Thai was disappointing - it tastes sweet and seemed like a dish catering to a more Western pallet.  The appetizers (dumplings and squid) were decent although not spectacular.  Overall, it was a worthwhile meal and I plan on ordering from them again - their curries and non-Pad Thai noodle dishes were very good.  I would other give a 3/5 stars if I could, but am rounding to 4 for this review.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai
5,2Ms9FpoHZ_tukzCzE23ogQ,Alina V.,4.0 star rating,"Cute little Thai place in Hoboken, they have outdoor seating (where we sat) and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The place is also byob and they provide an ice bucket if you need one. We got there around 615 and made it in time for the early bird specials which run 4pm to 7pm. For $15 (or $16 depending on the protein you get in your entree) you get a soup (tom yum or coconut), a small side salad with peanut sauce, an appetizer (fried calamari, Thai dumplings with chicken and shrimp, spring rolls, or shrimp rolls) and then you pick an entree with the protein you want (veggie, tofu, chicken, shrimp, squid, beef). We got 2 or the specials, so we tried both soups and for the entree we got the chicken pad Thai and the basil sauce with veggies and squid which comes with white rice. Some things were too spicy for me but everything tasted great!

Their lunch special was $8 dollars for an entree, spring roll, and salad. The salad was pre-made and brought out pretty fast, globbed with peanut dressing and a few tomatoes over lettuce, I wasn't impressed. The spring roll tasted like it was sitting at the bottom of one of those plastic chinese-delivery containers for a while. For my entree I took the peanut curry with shrimp. I asked how spicy it was and I was told medium (it ended up being mild actually imo), but it would have been nice if they offered to cater it to my liking. The peanut curry itself wasn't bad, all though I only got around 4 pieces of shrimp (with the tails intact, and no knife, they did bring one though after I asked). I suppose I got what I paid for here, an OK fast thai lunch with no frills. If I was back in Hoboken I would likely try another establishment first before returning.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

I kid you not!I retorted ""wait, if I ordered as I was walking to the table, I'd be fine, but after waiting while you folded napkins forget it?""  She said ""sorry""I implored her not to do this, she'd be losing good long time customers, but she stood motionless.  If a place wants to play a game of technicalities with me, they lose me.  Make up your own mind if you want to go there.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

13,Zb4c8sWdwFPf0r9YuKQQsw,Shanen L.,3.0 star rating,"Walked in here for dinner around 7-8pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of tables open. The space is small, but from what I could see it didn't tend to fill up too often. We were immediately seated and were asked for drink and app orders shortly after. They also brought out a bottle opener and offered glasses for our BYOB drinks. I ordered a tom yum soup (Thai hot) for my app, while others at the table got the grilled squid and a fried roll. My soup came out nice and spicy, just the way I like it. If you like it this way (and not watered down) make sure to ask for it Thai hot. I didn't try the fried roll, but my friend finished it so I assume it was fine. The grilled squid, however, was completely rubbery and pretty inedible. My friend tried one piece and I tried another to confirm it was terrible. So this remained untouched after this. A server later asked us if she should pack this to go and we told her no, to which she relied, ""No good?"" and received an honest answer about it being chewy beyond eating. For entrees one of my friends ordered Penang curry, which is tasty and good for people who don't want much spice. My other friend and I each ordered the green curry with chicken. I forgot to order it Thai hot- and wish that I had. I found this to be a very mild and underwhelming dish, despite being edible enough. My friend, however, thought it was too spicy for her taste (we both had the same spice level, which is the regular as it comes). So if you are a fan of spicy Asian cuisines, order Thai hot, and if you can't handle Asian spice maybe order it mild. Service wasn't exactly friendly, nor was it unfriendly- despite maybe an eye roll when friend was deciding on order choice. Just kind of quick and to the point in general. I probably wouldn't come back here, but if you're in the area and need a quick Thai to-go or delivery, you're probably pretty safe on ordering a curry dish- just specify your desired level of spice.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

They have an awesome Lunch Menu that is a great deal compared to other lunch spots in Hoboken. I got the Shrimp Spicy Rice which was $8.60 with tax, you also get a house salad and a spring roll with the lunch menu. All were very delicious and you get a nice sized plate of food. The food came out quick and the service was great. My only complaint was having only 4-5 Shrimp in the rice, which is usually the case with Shrimp dishes. Restaurants tend to go on the lighter side but would have liked a few more Shrimp in there. Definitely worth checking out, you won't regret it.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

I chose the coconut soup (with veggies instead of chicken) made with coconut milk and what tasted like fish sauce that provided a subtle salty enhancement to the normally bland tasting coconut milk. It was a nice balance that made it surprisingly tasty. Then, I had the chicken satay app, your regular standard satay. And for the entree, beef with Thai rice mixed with scallions, onions, and tomatoes.

They expected us to use small appetizer plates for dinner as we were sharing , we requested bigger plates.One of my friends had started using the small appetizer plate for dinner , they came with bigger plates & literally took the small plate out of my friend while she was eating food.This is one most uncourteous and rude behavior I have seen in a restaurant. When we mentioned to our server she should not be doing this she instead of apologizing got mad.During the rest of the dinner time nobody came to us to ask if needed anything else or to refill water glasses.On top of this they had the audacity to put compulsory 20% gratuity.Overall a really bad experience,",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

About two pieces of shrimp and if your feeling a little under the weather this will give you that boost you need. I then get the chili basil chicken. Holy smokes, this entree is mouthwatering. A little spicy but full of amazing flavor. I don't like their noodle dishes here sadly, but the entrees makes up for it and some. Also, their strawberry and sticky rice dessert is so good. It's light, satisfying, and delicious. The thing that makes T Thai even better is that they are consistent!!

I came with 3 friends and after we each ordered our food, they came out with an appetizer salad for each of us, simple iceberg lettuce with a bit of tomato and shredded carrots in a peanut sauce/dressing, as well as a miniature spring roll. It was a nice surprise, since none of us realized we'd be getting complimentary anything with our entrees, but both the salad and the spring roll were meh. The spring roll barely had anything in it - it looked a decent size, but it was mostly more of the dough/wrapping inside than filling. As for the pad thai that I ordered, the noodles were cooked very well, long and just chewy enough for my liking. However, I chose to order shrimp pad thai, rather than chicken, tofu, or beef, and I counted three shrimps. TOTAL. When I paid extra for the shrimp (it's slightly more expensive than chicken or tofu). Therefore, I can only give the food a B.Service: C+Sub par. I asked for my pad thai to be made spicy. It was not...at all. I didn't bother complaining since I was starving and didn't want to wait longer to eat, so I just mixed in hot sauce. I was very disappointed though. Other than that, the service was average. They weren't overly friendly, but we got our food and our waters were refilled. *shrug*Ambiance: B-This place is decorated very simply, nothing special. It was quiet here on a Sunday afternoon. There were maybe one or two other tables. One table was a man alone with his cellphone, which kept beeping incredibly loudly.

The food is pretty honest. I wouldn't say that it is the best Thai Food I've ever had, but it is taste. Honestly, if you are in doubt, give it a try! And by the way, everybody has to keep in mind that you get what you pay for. If you want a $1000 dish in a $1.000.000 restaurant, pay for it!

We just stopped in because we needed to eat dinner before hopping the bars, we were both in a mood for Asian and it was nearby. It was kind of a random visit, but I'm glad we went! Here's why...First off, the food was awesome. Portions weren't incredibly generous like you would expect from most restaurants these days, but they were adequate. We had two small spring roll starters, both had Pad Thai for entrees and shared a mango ice cream for dessert. Start to finish, an awesome meal.What made it even more awesome is that these days, the food equivalent of what we ordered would usually yield a bill of at least $50 at most other restaurants.

I went here for dinner on tour the other night with the rest of my crew, and having never been to this particular restaurant before, I decided to order some standards to get a baseline for the place. I ordered the tom yung goong and som tam (savory green papaya salad?).RE: $ -- Prices weren't high for NYC metro area standards, but you don't feel cheated out of your money. It's good enough food.RE: food -- Stupid and nitpicky, but the tom yung only came in shrimp form, and that's exactly how it should be. I was really excited when it showed-up, and the flavor combo (though it was a little light on the lemongrass) was pretty correct, save for the fact that it just wasn't spicy. Again, with the som tam, no chilis in sight. The papaya used wasn't soggy (still had that nice crunch to it), but it was missing tomatoes and chili peppers. I promise it's not that it just wasn't spicy enough, there was no spice involved at all. I also realize that this could very well be a pro for some people, but these are two dishes that, to me, feel naked without a little heat.RE: service -- Prompt, not rude, not particularly familiar. Some of my crew's been coming here and literally ordering the same thing on the same night for months, and they don't remeber their orders. Then again, that's the sort of thing that I think should earn a place an extra star instead of subtracting one.All in all, decent menu selection -- not all of it Thai, but not so obnoxiously fusion that it's worth crying about.

It just seemed to fit with this cold weather that I try to warm up with a type of cuisine that warms my body and my soul. So on one of the coldest days I've felt all year, I braved the cold and took a trip down to T. Thai for some spicy treats to beat the heat. You've probably passed it countless times on your way to and from the path train, but may have never really given them a second thought. Just off the corner of 1st and Hudson, the same blue awning has marked the spot since I could remember. There aren't too many tables in the restaurant, so I don't suggest it for large groups. However, if you're looking for a quiet date spot, then this could be a place to check out. The staff was very friendly and attentive, but with only 5 tables to look over, I'd hope so. As per usual, I had the fried calamari with a sweet dipping sauce. Even though they only served the body pieces (they left out the delicious tentacle-y parts), the calamari had just enough bread to be crispy, but was still juicy and chewy. It would give my favorite calamari's a run for their money. For our main course, we went family style and ordered the Tom Yum Kai (a spicy lemon grass soup with chicken), Red Curry with chicken, bamboo shoots, and sweet pepper, and the Pad See Ew (flat noodle with beef). The first thing that I noticed once the food was server was that the portion sizes were too small for me; however, I think that they are just right for ""normal"" appetites. I will not let my need to gorge penalize this fine establishment. The next thing that I noticed was that each dish was PACKED with flavor. The spicy soup was EXTRA spicy and the flat noodles were REALLY saucy.  While I really enjoyed all the flavor, this was the first time I thought it might have been over seasoned. Usually I say go big or go home, but I swear I could taste the MSG (just a joke, I don't know if they really used any or not). For desert, we tried their Fried Ice Cream (only comes in vanilla) and their Sticky Rice with Strawberries. Again, these dishes were small in portion, but BIG in flavor. It seems every semester I have the pleasure of reviewing a Thai restaurant. I remember eating here several years ago, but for some reason unknown to me, I never went back. It is really easy for a restaurant to get lost in the culinary shuffle of Hoboken, but boy was I glad I went back. While the stores around them have changed, T.

The place is pretty small with only a handful of tables, which were full when we first got there - always a good sign. We were starving so just as the waitress gave us our waters I immediately ordered an appetizer - the grilled squid. Though it came with a good sweet/sour peanut sauce, and the squid was cooked properly, they only gave the body portions (I like eating tentacles - get over it, that's the tastiest part). For my entree I ordered the Chili Paste and Basil dish with tofu and eggplant. I'm a total carnivore, but occasionally I like to have an alternative, so I opted for tofu. They cooked it really well, very soft and gooey, unlike most places that will fry the tofu or cook it in a way that makes it gummy. This was just right and the spices worked very well. The portions are pretty decent, and I probably could have taken some home for a nice leftover lunch had it not been for my dad who was famished and proceeded to eat the rest of my meal.

Try the Basil Sauce sauteed with chiken (my favorite). You can go traditional and order Pad Thai with (choice of chicken,beef,tofu,vegetable,shrimp,squid). Two main dish I usually get is Rice Noodle and Broccoli with Beef (prefer no egg) or Basil Sauce Sauteed w. onions,scallions,peppers. Pros: Decent price and serviceCons: Dark and small tables, gets packed during lunch time.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

My man and I have been here multiple times, and each time their food has been consistantly fresh and comes out rather quickly. This establishment is BYOB so we bring our own bottle of wine (which is always lovely). The waitstaff is extremely pleasent and helpful. One night we ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert; somehow the check was still only $23! In this area, you can't get more bang for your buck.",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

211,s3c-E5yP042P7rTm3Ob5eg,jenny a.,4.0 star rating,"having lived in NYC and patroned many Thai places, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good T Thai was. It beats Sri Thai and other ones people raved about. I'm sure like any other restaurant, it has good and not so great days. I had the calamari, Steak salad to perfection, the pad thai with shrimp was particularly good that night, mildly sweet, and REAL pad thai noodles. Ice tea was just the right amount of condensed milk. The decor, however, is a bit depressing, with the dark maroon walls. From the outside it can look a bit discouraging. Nonetheless, good service, clean and pleasant (I went with a group of friends).",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai
212,32vk6hJy0VzheI_mwJGGrQ,Ashley B.,5.0 star rating,"Yum I love this place. I recommend the Panang Curry, it is SO DELICIOUS and every time I have ordered delivery, it always comes quickly and warm and I always end up craving it the rest of the week. It is less expensive than a lot of the other Thai places and they always answer the phone and are courteous. The last time I was craving Thai food I wanted to try another Thai place because I had seen good reviews and I wanted to broaden my horizons so I called the other THai restaurant on Bloomfield street (I can't think of the name @ the moment) but they never even answered their phone and a few times there was a dial tone like they were just hanging up the phone. WOW thanks. Anyways I decided to stick with what I know and like and ordered from T Thai on Hudson street and wasn't disappointed at all! This is my thai place!",T Thai,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai
