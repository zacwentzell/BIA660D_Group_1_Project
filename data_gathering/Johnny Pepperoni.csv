It's authentic & absolutely fantastic. I feel like I'm in Italy with every bite. The bruschetta is so good - the toast is crispy & soft (you'll understand what I'm talking about when you try it) and the ricotta and tomatoes are amazing and fresh. The square pizza pie is to die for - we always have so much to take home, and I am satisfied for days. The pricing is reasonable and the service is great. It's BYOB which is another huge plus in Hoboken. Highly recommend!",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

2,JZJIG5KdsJHITf0i0loGXw,Joe E.,2.0 star rating,"People have been raving about this place to me for a couple of years. Mostly around the amazing square pie they serve. So, we decided to make a trip here last weekend for a homecoming party. They do not take reservations, but we were told that we would be seated pretty quickly. When we arrived, we immediately found ourselves having to wait out in the rain because there is a real lack of an area to wait inside, but that was not all that bad since we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We got seated around 8:50 PM and we were immediately surrounded by about 3 servers, who surrounded us to fill our water and open our bottles of wine (score BYOB). As a large group, we took about 5 minutes to figure out what we would start off with. After another 5 minutes our waiter came over, gave us some suggestions and took our first order of appetizers. The appetizers were pretty good, we started with; the Antipasti Platter, wings, rice balls and a square pizza. The Antipasti Platter was a huge let down for the price we paid, it kind of looked like they just threw some leftovers on a plate and served it. The rice balls were okay, not something I enjoy, but everybody else seemed to like them. The wings, nothing special, just wings, but the square pie was pretty great! It really had us looking forward to try out some of the other pies. The restaurant was pretty busy and we kept waiving over to our waiter, who seemed overwhelmed with other tables. We asked the bus-boy if we could place our dinner order when he came over to fill-up our water, but he said our waiter had to do that, but he would tell him to come over. Finally, after about 10 minutes he came over, apologized and took our order for 4 pizzas. Then tragedy...he came back about 3 minutes later and told us that the kitchen was closed. Apparently the kitchen has a hard close time of 10pm, which nobody thought to share with us when we sat down or ordered. I quickly looked at my watch which read 10:01. I told him that we actually ordered a couple of minutes ago, but he again apologized. When I asked why he did not share that the kitchen would not serve after 10:00, he just shrugged and said he was sorry. I know that places have to close, but this seemed a little excessive considering that we did order before the kitchen closed and nobody mentioned this closing time to us. So, we did not have a chance to try out all the other pizzas that were on the menu. So we left hungry and made a walk down to Mario's, which was still open and more then happy to take our money. I guess we will never know what their pizza taste like since we will not be heading back.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

I didn't see much of the inside, but the outdoor seating was really nice, especially since the pizzeria is located in a calmer residential part of Hoboken. We shared the burrata cheese appetizer ($18) off the specials menu. It was a heaping ball o' cheese accompanied by prosciutto and a little balsamic reduction and olive oil. The appetizer was quickly destroyed. For some greenery, we ordered two marinated mushroom salads ($9) to share. There was nothing negative to say about the salads, only positive things like ""Yum."" In addition to the mushrooms, there were artichokes, onions, and basil, topped off with a balsamic vinaigrette. Eventually we decided on the prosciutto and arugula ($20) and chicken parmigiana ($19) pizzas. I was willing to try the clam pie since it sounded like the most out there option, but no one else was game. Both pizzas were popular at our table. I thought the chicken parm one was a little heavy since there was fried chicken atop a pizza, but that was just me. I probably gravitated more towards the prosciutto pie but it was a slightly salty due to the prosciutto. Unfortunately we found a long blondish hair baked into one of the pizzas. We didn't say anything just to prevent a fuss, but it wasn't exactly the highlight of the meal.I think our server was named Danny, and he was ultra-polite, and he and some other staffers kept an eye on us.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

When the bill came, the waiter was nice enough to remove the horrible salad without us asking but the bill still came out to $26 bucks. Hoboken Italian/pizza places are a dime a dozen.

The breading wasn't too much and the filling was filled with rice, cheese, and prosciutto. A great way to start. Most people I think go with the pizza at JP's. A few people at the table got pastas and chicken dishes but I stuck with the pizza. For the table, we got the pepperoni pie, chicken parm pie, and the clam pie. All three were honestly great in their own way. I would favor the clam pie though. It is pretty spicy with red peppers, but the flavors were all there. What makes this place great was the service.

Sadness!Second- An order costs you $14 for six of these sorry little molluscs. Third- The bread crumbs were bland.

The pies are slightly thicker than your typical NY slice, but not so thick that they get soggy. But of course, the pepperoni is the bell of the ball. These little slices get crispy edges that turn up and create tiny little pools of pepperoni oil that make this pizza so goddamn rich and delectable. The pro-tip move at this joint though, is to get the chicken parm pizza and add pepperoni to it. You'll forget about any other pizza you've ever eaten, if only for that moment.Other than the food though, this is a great BYOB joint to bring friends and family.

For an appetizer we had the Cherry Tomato and Ricotta Bruschetta which was really good. It's basically a cherry tomato sliced a couple times with ricotta cheese and bread. Different than the traditional bruschetta but I really liked it.

Thinking there might have been a miscommunication, I told the hostess that we asked for a pint and the serving in the bag wasn't the right amount, she was clearly annoyed. She came back with another child's cup and I again pointed out that we asked for a pint in order to accomodate four people and that we have ordered this in the past without issue. Her annoyance escalated to anger. She said she had to charge me extra, which I happily agreed to. She then went to the kitchen staff to ask for a larger container. One of the waiters (who I think was also manager) asked why and when she angrily told him he very loudly (and within six feet of me) exclaimed ""who the f--k orders a pint of ice cream!"" And ""why don't they just go and buy it at the f--king store!"". The hostess answered with ""I have no idea"". Needless to say, extremely embarrassing and rude.

We recently moved right outside of Hoboken where they don't deliver anymore.. not a problem, we pick it up now. Take out is completely opposite of dining there. The first time, fine, no big deal. The second time, this is annoying. Third time, we called. Tonight.. we made sure to check the salads before we left, (& got them fixed) but I forgot to check the pizza.. But should I really have to? Not only do you get hung up on mid-order, but the simple order process is terrible. Why are you asking me if I need chicken on a chicken Cesar salad? And yet, they forgot to put it on the salad anyway! I checked that there so they added it. But the dressing wasn't Cesar! The pizza, half chicken parm and half sausage.. well they put them together on the whole pie.. yes chicken parm/sausage on the pizza. We gave it a try, it's not a good combo. We called and spoke to the manager RICH, stated first off we love the place and the food, but EVERY time we order there's some issue with our food never being correct. No matter how many times we tried to diffuse this guy, he kept arguing with us, so we wished him a good night and hung up. The manager and take out staff definitely needs to wake up and start paying attention because there is nothing wrong with the food. We love the place, but we might have to start finding a new pizza place because we couldn't eat anything of the $47 order (two salads and a pizza).Posting these pics because apparently we're wrong (said the manager). Do yourself a favor, either go there or double check your ENTIRE order. Good luck Johnny Pep's, you lost a frequent customer.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

It would be so great if someone actually brought me a pie right about now...So AMAZING service. They were constantly checking up on us, making sure everything was good, refilling our waters, and anything else we neededBYOB- always a great thing!ok, so for appetizers we got the ricotta bruschetta- that was soo sooo good-- a lit tip for them I wish it had some balsamic drizzle, but still great. The calamari- really good, and came with two dipping sauces. The green salad and the Caesar salad- both good and the dressing was good and not too much..Now for the best part- the pizza- we ordered 3 pies- the grandma, the mushroom and fontina, and the chicken parm. ALL THREE WERE GREAT. We asked them to cut the slices smaller so everyone at the table could sample them, and they did. My favorite was the grandma slice, then the chicken parm, then the mushroom. Everyone at the table enjoyed the pizzas... I really wanna go back and get some more..We sat outside on the outdoor patio and it was a gorgeous night out. We sat there awhile finishing our drinks and we were not rushed at all to leave. Great experience, definitely wanna come back!!",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

They have plenty of seating both in and outdoors. The service is also really great; waters always refilled, made recommendations and was knowledgable about the food. We started off with a special caprese salad which was heirloom tomato, balsamic, mozzarella (very good) and basil- was there was more basil. We then had half of the sausage and broccoli Rabe specialty pie (loved the biting red onions on there- its a white pizza) and half of the fried eggplant with capers - I really loved this one.  The crust was especially soft and gooey despite thin crust- a lot of thin crusts tend to be really dry.

Still,  I wasn't looking for an upscale meal anyway so it was just fine.The biggest surprise of the night was not the pizza but how awesome the chicken wings are. Actually, our server made a mistake and brought us buffalo wings instead of the BBQ that we requested. This was honestly a great mistake because the buffalo wings were the best wings I've had in a long time. If you see it on the specials list, you *have* to get the wings. They aren't your dinky freshman 25-cent special Applebee's wings from college. They're more like the ""REAL TALK, AMERICANS DO EVERYTHING BIGGER"" wings. And they are awesome.

I mean who could ask for more?!However the last time I went there with a group of girlfriends, we had a horrible experience. On the day of one of the women's world cup final games this year, we went to Johnny Pepperoni immediately following their win - of course with the game being late-ish in the day, we sent our friend up to the restaurant before closing so she could get us a table for when we arrived - which she did. She arrived at 9:40 - and the place officially closes at 10 - so we figured - OK we're safe. Seated WELL before closing. We were WRONG.When our friend arrived and asked for a table, the place was in full swing - full tables outside and a handful of tables inside. She was greeted by the host who told her ""if you want to eat, you need to order by 9:45 - also we shut the doors at 10:30 so you have to be done by then."" WOW - great customer service right?When she sat down, they forced her to order for all of us since we were still trying to get there - so she scrambled to get answers while the waiter hovered impatiently. It was one of her first times there, so she had to guess. And finally when we arrived moments later, we realized she hadn't put in the full order. No big deal right? They give you bread at the table to nosh on, we'll survive. NOPE. We sat for 20mins, no offer of bread or even water from the wait staff. We actually had to flag a waiter down to ask if we could have some!The experience at that point was so bad, that we ate our meal and got the hell out of dodge well before their 10:30 mandatory heave-ho. Moral of the story - if you're going here, go early, because apparently this restaurant doesn't give a crap about its customers when it's close to closing time.As for us - there are enough places in Hoboken that we can go to that this place won't see us for quite awhile.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

We were taken by the host to a table for two, that was perhaps slightly bigger than our 14"" pizza pie. I knew that it was a small table, plus it was shaky, plus the big family who took the table next to ours had loud kids. Just fine. So, after we placed our order we asked our server if we could take the other table. Ha! The answer came right on- NO! He didn't care why we wanted to move, he said we expect it to be a busy night, so sorry you can't take table for 4. Fair enough, but dude, there were empty tables for two as well.

I had to speak to two different people before someone called the manager.  I will be going somewhere else for my birthday now (luckily another hoboken pizza place was able to accommodate me) and I'll be choosing other places to take my friends in the future after this experience.  Not a good idea to mislead a local on her 30th!",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

That being said, though...I wouldn't necessarily want to eat inside on a Saturday night again. Let me explain.We stopped at a nearby liquor store to pick up a bottle of red wine to have with dinner on Saturday (10/25). The ""wine glasses"" were actually juice glasses, but I was willing to overlook that. The noise level indoors was insane; maybe it was because it must have been Take Your Shrieking Hellbeast Spawn To Johnny Pepperoni Day (I swear, people, two words: birth control. Look into it, won't you? Thank you.) But thanks to the delicious wine, we were able to block out most of the distracting sounds, although I couldn't understand 80% of what our waiter said when he mentioned the specials to us (sorry Edwin).We ordered the fried calamari with mushrooms as an appetizer, and it was huge. We both knew there was no way we could finish it. Most of it was pretty good, although I think some of the calamari pieces were chewier than they should have been, and one of the dipping sauces had an odd lemony aftertaste. For our main courses, I ordered the Spaghetti al Pomodoro, and my boyfriend had the rigatoni with sausage in a white wine sauce. Both dishes were cooked well, but again, the portions were simply too large for us to handle, and we ended up having to take some home. I liked the tomato sauce with my dish; it was a rustic-style sauce with pieces of tomato skin and seeds scattered throughout, but it wasn't overly heavy or rich. I sampled some of my boyfriend's rigatoni and liked the white wine sauce, as well.Our service overall was spotty; I think Edwin may have forgotten about us from time to time because he was busy manning the register as well as cleaning off tables and maneuvering his way around screaming children. But he maintained a pleasant attitude the entire time he waited on us, and he did check on us to see how we liked our meals, so that was good, at least.If we ever were to come back to Johnny Pepperoni, I think a random weeknight would be best for us (like, say Tuesday night).

128,KOygMqXCqAmCmktxYXyL1g,Scott H.,4.0 star rating,"One of my favorite pizza places in town, right up there with Grimaldi's and Napoli's.  I've only tried the thin-crust pizza so far, but it's good:  just the right amounts of sauce and cheese, and really great, high-quality toppings.  The sausage is probably the best in town, and the roasted mushrooms and peppers are good too.  The crust is more crispy than chewy - I like Napoli's better - but still good.  The antipasta is also good, and pretty filling, as it leans towards meats & cheeses as opposed to vegetables.  Plan on splitting it with a few other people if you still want to have room for the pizza.  When the weather is nice, the tree-lined patio is a great place to eat, and when it isn't, takeout is usually quick (30 mins or so).",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

This particular one really excels in super friendly service, and portions. As far as pizza quality goes, I'm still giving the crown to Dozzinos, but this is about on par with San Giuseppe, and better than Grimaldi's. We started with an antipasto plate, and there was a ton of meat there. We followed that up with a pizza with ricotta and prosciutto, which again, was totally loaded with meat.

To start, the buffalo wings are heavily breaded, soggy and taste of poor quality. Not to mention, they're outrageously expensive. The fritto misto is mostly scraps of fried batter, a couple pieces of calamari and mushrooms. The calamari I did have the privilege of finding was chewy and overly battered. The chicken piccata entree was horrendous. The sauce tasted mostly of butter and capers, not a hint of wine or lemon. Their chicken, pounded thin was overcooked and rubbery. The best part of the dish was the pasta. The dining area is cramp, the pre dinner bread is ice cold and you can completely forget about trying to have a conversation in here.

I consider this more of a pizza restaurant. When I think pepperoni, I think pizza, everyone at tables near us had pizza so, of course, we tried the pizza.They make excellent pizza here. We ordered ours topped with ($2-3 per topping) arugula, sausage, cherry peppers, and olives. Crust was delicious. Topping was delicious.  Only thing was we expected black olives and really couldn't see any, waiter said they use kalamata? instead.  Think I'll pass on the olives next time. Anyway, a delicious pizza, cooked perfect, my compliments. Nice waiter, nice hostess, and I appreciate that. We didn't order dessert, too full.They have some Italian dishes on the menu that you'd typically find in an Italian restaurant. They have a few inexpensive options for kids.

The service has always been fantastic. The first time we went we had to wait for a table, so the hostess offered to open our wine for us, gave us some bread and sat us at a little bar in the back to wait. I think that was going above and beyond so we didn't have to stand and wait around.The food is great, the first time I went I got the spaghetti and meatballs which was fantastic the meatballs weren't dry and had plenty of flavor like my Nonna used to make, the sauce was equally as good. This second time we went back I got this Mac and Cheese type dish which was phenomenal!!! My fiance got the pesto shrimp, she liked it but the texture of it bothered her so she didn't eat a whole lot of it. I don't advise going around 6:30-7 because this is when the soccer moms come out with all their kids. We were sat next to a family of 6 the kids were all over the place, running into me and the table and the parents did or said nothing, but that's bad parenting not bad service on part of the restaurant. But there seemed to be a ton of kids in there at that time. But, if you are a parent and your kid is running into tables, my advice would be tell your kid to stop, at that point they aren't cute, they're annoying...ok off soapbox.My only wish is that they had picked a better name.

It's BYOB, which is great. The little glasses they bring out for your wine are adorable. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the prices are pretty steep.

I told the hostess that I wanted to dine in and be seated, and she looked at me and said ""Oh, I thought it was a to-go order"" and STILL didn't seat me, even though the restaurant was full of empty seats.

The staff is great and if you go there a lot, you can tell they remember you. I have three favorites at JP: prosciutto and arugula pizza, mushroom pizza and the Nutella desert pizza. You need to try all three, but especially the first one: it seems crazy, but it's like eating a fresh salad on top of a great slice of pizza. The salads are great too, but they're huge!

We had a caprese salad app which was a special and great. And then for dinner the prosciutto and arugula pie which was so delicious.

I do not understand the logic of listing one type of meat in the dish, but excluding the other ingredients. There are lots of people that do not eat pork, yet quite a few restaurants find it acceptable to put sausage, prosciutto, ham, bacon, and all sorts of unacceptable things in the dish. Surely they would have listed if there were crab meat or lobster in the dish due to allergies of people; but why not list meats to take into consideration that almost 2/3 of the worlds population do not eat pork? If it's beef ragu, either only put beef in the dish, or if you put other meats in them, just list them so people are aware of what they eat.

They're $3 each and you get one big slice of bread with toppings. We tried the one with ricotta and tomato. I liked the bread and ricotta and basil, but the huge bite of cherry tomato didn't seem to blend well. Would be better diced I think. The pizza was good.  You could tell it was fresh, especially the basil.  I don't eat mushrooms but my two friends thought the mushrooms they used were unusual.  I really liked the crust.  The sauce was ok.  It had a little bit too much sauce for my taste.  The disappointment was the cheese.  As Rebecca stated below me somewhere, you couldn't at all tell if that it was ""fresh"" mozzerella, which it supposedly was.   Anyway, I'd come back.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

I wish I could give 3.5 stars.We sat at the bar because the rest of the dining area was packed with loud families and kids.  One of my issues is that the kids are always running around in here (which isn't something I can contribute to the restaurant).  The floors are tiled and there isn't much of the walls to deaden the sound so the room can get very loud at times.  I'm going to have to try sitting outside when it gets consitantly warmer out.I've sat at the bar both times when I've been here so I can't speak for the rest of the dining room but the service has been good. Water glass is always full and the guy behind the ""bar"" was chatty enough to seem welcoming.Started by splitting the fritto misto.  It was decent enough, I love calamari and fennel so I couldn't help myself.  The portion size was a little small for the price.  Wanting to try things from all over the menu we also split a ceasar salad which was good.  Ordered the mushroom & fontina pizza as the main to split.  In my opinion there weren't enough mushrooms on the pizza but the taste was there with the fontina, garlic and thyme. The crust was cooked well.Like others have said, BYOB helps keep the cost down at Johnny Pepperoni's which helps.

I like going here for Italian dishes and Napoli's for pizza. The chicken piccata tastes like if you made it at home, it's so good. The waiters at the place are an interesting bunch-they will go above and beyond for you. A friend of mine left something behind after a meal and server kept it safe until we went back for it. We also brought our own wine, finished it up, and jokingly asked them for more wine. The waiter then said that people sometimes don't finish their BYO wine and the restaurant holds onto them so they don't go to waste...we each got an extra glass of free wine. That was pretty awesome. It's a casual place, ambiance is nothing special (feels like an old school pizzeria), and some tables/chairs are uncomfortable, but food (minus pizza) and service is phenomenal.

After living in Denver forever I just can't get over how great most pizza and Italian food is in Hoboken, and Johnny Pepperoni is my favorite so far. I had never experienced the BYOB thing before but it is so cool. I don't drink so I always feel bad when I go to a restaurant and know I am going to be spending and tipping less than most other people since I don't drink. But at a BYO place who cares! Not only do they not serve booze, but they have the special old-school Cokes in bottles which my boyfriend loves. So he was happy too.The setting is super cute and I found it warm and inviting in a fairly upscale way. They have a great bar where we sat, which I liked because we were kind of up and away from all the other tables so we could have a nice quiet chat. I had a radicchio salad which was phenomenal. And huge. It cost like $9 which is a lot for a salad but it really was a decent value considering its enormous size. I had to stop myself from finishing it because I wanted to save room for pizza. But it was great. Now the pizza, holy crap. It was delicious. We had a square pie with cheese so it was very simple but it was awesome The crust was so good. I have found crust is definitely what separates New York/New Jersey pizza from other pizza that just can't measure up. It is like a good bagel I suppose - crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. It makes me feel sad that I wasted my time and calories eating pizza in Denver for all those years.The only reason I'm not giving Johnny Pepperoni five stars is that the service was on the spacey side. I would just have liked her to check in a little more often. But everyone was super friendly so it was really just a timing thing.

Further, I've only taken the takeout route (so service cannot be properly assessed).It took me a few months to finally get around to trying this place (which is pretty pathetic because I probably live about 50 walking paces away and am no stranger to takeout/delivery establishments), but all in all not bad. However, I don't think I agree with the 4/5 ratings here (seem awfully inflated). For one, the ""fresh"" mozzarella on the pies is shredded and isn't at all reflective of the globs of yummy mutz found elsewhere in Hoboken. Doesn't taste especially great either. The crust is thin, which is a plus, but the tomato sauce doesn't seem that remarkable.The pepperoni definitely isn't as good as that at Napoli or Grimaldi's. The sausage seems to be about on par. Overall execution, however, definitely ranks below both.Props for the idea for the arugula and prosciutto pizza...they do not skimp on either of these ingredients. However, one weird thing to note about the prosciutto: it seemed almost fatty, which was weird. I've never been served fatty prosciutto...I never thought salted meat could be made unappetizing to me.

221,aR8L-VbmDdtFlLBgyYkFOg,Liz D.,2.0 star rating,"Went here last night and have to disagree with most of the other reviewers. The calamari was over fried and had barely any calamari in it--ours had so much fried red onion it totally overpowered everything else. The baked ziti didn't have enough sauce and was very bland. For a place like this I really think they should serve better quality pasta, maybe even homemade. Not boxed pasta. The mushroom and fontina pizza was good although we asked for it to be well done and it was far from that and very salty. When our food came out I asked for fresh grated parmesan and they pointed at the fake stuff that is served at every other pizza place in Hoboken. I told our waitress I would really like fresh like the kind that comes on the salad. He said ""sure"" and came back with the fake stuff again, but this time in a bowl. As for the restaurant decor, it's cute but soft of weird with all the TVs. Two of the TVs had sponge bob on--sort of made us feel out of place. They also had WAY to many people working there. It was 2 servers to every table--in my opinion that's somewhat annoying bc they are constantly standing by your table. I really wanted to like this place bc the menu looked so good, but unfortunately we will not be returning until they make some changes. This place is definitely more of a family place, not a date place.  And lastly I do think they are a bit over-priced for a pizza place.  We will be sticking with Grimaldi's or Napoli's.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Nice touch that JP's is BYOB. Also nice that both JP's and City Bistro are very dog friendly and they don't mind seating you outside with your dog at all, weather permitting.

I love open kitchens in restaurants. Its a very inviting way to tell the customer ""Hey, our food is fresh. Watch us make it!"" it also puts me at ease because I know the kitchen is spotless. The restaurant was definitely tiny (I wish it weren't so small). The downside is that it was definitely noisy. But that really is the ONLY downside to this place.    My wife and I ate there last night. We shared a Caesar saiad and a thin crust pizza with spicy sausage and arugula. There were no seats but we had the option of eating at the bar so we took it right away. Our experience from start to finish was authentic Italian. Even our server was from Italy. Despite it being so busy, he was attentive and knowledgeable. He poured us each a glass of wine (BYOB) and brought bread right away.    Now for the food. The Caesar dressing was homemade. You could tell right away because you could see and taste flecks of anchovy. The lettuce was super crisp and it was not drenched in dressing. The pizza was out of this world. Not over-sauced, or over-cheesed (although its hard to even imagine such a thing could be negative), this pizza had the perfect balance of topping to crust ratio. The crust was chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.   For dessert, we ordered the zeppole's to go . They were super airy and flavorful. It did not need to be drenched in powdered sugar to taste good. Even the cappucinos were great. Our server made them more delicate care than I have seen in a long time. Now for my favorite part. The owner, John was amazing. Despite it being busy, he took time out to check in with his customers. He offered to buy me and my wife dessert. Even though we declined, he asked us questions about what we thought. I definitely appreciated that he not only wanted feedback but that he took the time to get to know the people who give him business. I am very excited to see this place grow in all sorts of ways.

And the penne (?) with white wine and sausage is a close second.  The ""gourmet"" pizzas aren't great. They're heavy handed with the truffle oil, and it makes the too rich. The regular pizzas are good though. All in all great food. Plus it's byob. A few minor criticisms though. One, they've apparently developed a niche as a family friendly place, which is fine, but there's always little brats screaming their heads off. We come as late as we can for dinner and almost never for lunch anymore. Which leads me to two, they used to have a lunch/brunch menu, and it was very good. They had hot subs and a great egg and Italian sausage dish. But they no longer use that menu at lunch and now just use the dinner menu with dinner prices. Fine if you're just getting pizza but it's a little pricey if you want something else (around $20 for the pastas). One other little quirk - notice the big sign painted on the side of the building says ""since 2010."" We live a few blocks away and walk past a couple times a week.

Also, it's very cheap which always brightens my day.  The only negative:  While I am by no means a grumpy old man (OK, that can probably be disputed), there can be tons of children here.  Which, in and of itself, is not a big deal.  But for some reason I haven't quite figured out yet, children run rampantly here - though the restaurant, the outdoors area, hanging out the windows...Maybe it's something in the pizza here, or too much sugar in the soda perhaps?  I guess when there are alot of children, parents that are self absorbed do not feel the obligation to ensure the behavior of their respective offspring, and the place takes on an atmosphere much like Gymboree, chuck e cheese, nursery school etc.So factoring in the children,  and the fact that its a pizzeria, it's not a place to try and impress that special someone you are courting, but an awesome place to bring some wine and have some pizza.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

262,Xz7JMDolLFp6ulk8UBQtmA,KB C.,5.0 star rating,This was by far the best Italian I've had in the 'boken.A great test for any Italian joint is to try the simple foods- We had delivery:  spaghetti/meatballs and a pizza.  Both of these foods were top notch- best pizza I've had out here bar none (this pizza was better than Grimaldi's and Napoli's)PS The pizza was still great heating it up 2 days later- that's commendable!,Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
263,usepd0hoDPZuCBFJYkpJ7A,M M.,5.0 star rating,"It took me 2 years to finally get to Johnny Pepperonis!  Because if you live in Hoboken you are always wary of new pizza places because why try to fix something that isnt broke ie Grimaldis & Napolis.  I was extremely impressed not only with the fantastic food but the wait staff were top notch.  We were a party of 9 (including children) and they were very accommodating and didn't scoff when we walked in, like many places do with that amount of people.The radicchio salad was outstanding!  I will be tasked to bring one to my sister every time I go to visit her.  The fritto misto was good, not heavy or oiley.  And I could have eaten a plate of the rice balls all by myself! Finally to the pizza, we ordered the chicken parm pizza on thing crust.  The crust was crispy but not doughy.  The sauce wasn't sweet.  My stomach is growling thinking of it now!  We also ordered the square pizza, that was a denser crust with a sweeter sauce.  Both very good but I will definitely go back just for the chicken parm pizza!!We ended the lunch with zeppolis, one word for them delicious.

(cue dramatic music)In summary, Johnny Pepperoni is basically attempting but falling short at doing what a place like Leo's already does well and more authentically. And JP's is more expensive.  Go to Leo's for a much better simple Italian meal.",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

271,k5rD7rsfhWrQv5AUX9L8Pg,RICHARD D.,5.0 star rating,Wow - we just walked in on the soft open of Johnny Pepperoni in Hoboken.  It's located at the corner of Park & 11th - former local of a decent restaurant who's name is lost in the back of my mind. Well on the surface you would think that Hoboken doesn't really need an other Italian eatery????  Johnny Pepperoni actually fills a gap in the Hoboken scene - a place where you can get a awesome pizza but not be at a pizzeria - it's a bit more modern and comfortable than any pizzeria or Italian restaurant in town  and more homey and friendly than Grimaldis ( and actually a better more crisp and generous pizza). Johnny Pepperoni is sort of Lombardi's on Spring St NYC meets Mario Bataldi.  We had the eggplant parm - excellent!! And the spaghetti and meatballs (veal) totally OFF THE HOOK - the sauce was perfect with lots of real tomato and taste and the meatballs the best I ever had.  It's byob and Sasso Deli is steps away.  The staff was super eager and the kitchen staff seemed totally in high gear - if they can keep their enthusiasm and warm attitude they will always be crowded. I sort of wish they had wine and beer - but byob can be a positive thing if you know in advance.  Think I'll stop in next week for a square pizza - looked great!!   Best of luck!!!!!,Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The food was great, but like with a lot of new restaurants, kinks still need to be worked out. I was served my appetizer right when the food came (I think the waitress forgot about us) and when the doors are closed, the main dining room can get relatively loud to the point where you can't hold a conversation with someone across from you without other people listening in.The staff is very accommodating and friendly - food extremely tasty and well-priced for the area.I will definitely go back and try other items on their menu - and soon, take out will be available too (major plus!).",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

299,F25RrC8FeBRAskNdZ5uIJg,Tammi D.,2.0 star rating,"I am not one to write reviews but my experiences with Johnny Pepperoni's have been so outstanding I had to get the word out. The minute the restaurant opened I was intrigued and pleasantly surprised that Hoboken has finally been blessed with a really good pizza place. I had worked in a pizzeria/Italian restaurant for 10 years and being Italian myself, I really have high standards. Johnny Pepperoni's food is definitely worth the visit. I've tried just about everything on the menu and it is all excellent. The pizza is perfection and I never thought I'd actually like a meatball outside my family's recipe until I tried theirs. However, it's not just the food that makes this place amazing, but the service as well. Being one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in Hoboken, I decided to get a few friends together there for my birthday back in September. There were 12 of us and despite my boyfriends many attempts to hold a table (they don't take reservations) we had to wait about an hour for a table to open up and didn't wind up sitting down until about 10PM. The owner graciously provided us with 2 plates of the antipasta platter while we waited. Once seated, they accommodated us completely, even waiving the plate fee for my cake. They made my birthday dinner exactly how I wanted it: easy and yummy. Then, this past holiday weekend, I decided to order from them on Wednesday evening, Thanksgiving eve. The girl on the phone took my order for ""Baked Ziti"" and said about 30-40 minutes for delivery. Over an hour later I had no Baked Ziti so I called and she placed me on the phone with the owner. He informed me he was calling the driver and to call him back if I didn't receive my order in 10 minutes. About 5 minutes later, the delivery guy was there but with something other than baked ziti. Hungry and a bit cranky, I called back, and the girl again placed me on the phone with the owner. He explained that they replaced the ""baked ziti"" on their older menu with whatever it is that arrived at my door. He must have heard the disappointment in my voice and told me he would make me whatever else I'd like and personally deliver it. So, I opted for the Eggplant Parm and within 15 minutes the delivery guy was at my door. A few moments later, the owner called me, asking if I received my order, how I liked it, and thanked ME for being patient and understanding. This by FAR is the BEST customer service I have received in all my dining experiences in Hoboken. For other restaurant owners out there, take a lesson from this guy. He exemplified what is it to be a truly successful restaurant by making sure the experience as a whole was enjoyable. 2 Thumbs up, 5 stars, simply amazing!",Johnny Pepperoni,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
