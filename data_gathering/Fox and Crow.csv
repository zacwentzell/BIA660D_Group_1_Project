Heights it's easy to get to as it is near to the Hoboken elevator and a short walk from Central Avenue. Inside there's two rooms, I think they have music in the back room and the front is the main bar area. It's nicely decorated in a hipster/ industrial kind of way and the servers are efficient. I liked the atmosphere, it's sort of like a 'nice' dive bar!The bar is known for it's cocktails which we didn't try as there is a great selection of beers, both bottled and on tap. The food is mostly burgers/sandwiches along with a few other bar food classics such as wings and nachos, a couple of salads and brunchy egg dishes and toasts. (They do serve the full menu during the weekend brunch but we did have to ask our server for it). We ordered burgers, there's a whole range of different patties and toppings to choose all served on onion brioche rolls, they were a good size and very tasty. Burgers come with hand cut fries that were excellent, very crispy and salted correctly. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and drink. I'll definitely be back for brunch and I'll also come back to check out their happy hour during the week and try a cocktail!",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"
1,0WzT84TJm-3uPMO3OKYS8g,Sasha G.,3.0 star rating,"I like Fox and Crow, especially their speakeasy-esque live music venue and bar at the back. They make a bangin' black bean veggie burger- I def recommend it. Not sure if it's vegan, vegan folks.Their ""fancy"" cocktails are also pretty darn good. And their french fries are crispy but they don't give enough ketchup. I also think they fancy up their ketchup by adding cumin or some other ish. My only reservation with this bar is that it has a personality disorder which confuses me. Is it a cool laidback bar/restaurant in The Heights or an overpriced, overhyped bar downtown? I can't tell. I do know, however, that their fries though crispy are too thick for my liking and that a few cocktails and some food will cost you a pretty penny. It also annoys me that this bar and their prices are a direct result of yuppies moving into the Heights.",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"
2,yng1Qey0-YrDyreCjwDwzw,Dan G.,3.0 star rating,"Pluses and minuses, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Truth is I was considering a 2 star review but again, pluses and minuses so I'm going with 3 stars. Simple take is that its a better bar than restaurant and they have some staffing issues that I think are a direct reflection of ownership...and not in a good way. If the owner is reading this (and I highly doubt they take any time to read Yelp reviews) then please know I am not exaggerating nor getting self righteous or mean spirited on this post. We walked in on a slow and chilly Saturday afternoon for lunch and were impressed with the small dining area. Nicely put together in a fun off beat funky novel manner. I commented on how much i liked the wall-paper. The drink menu was very interesting as was they brunch menu....we wound up asking for and ordering off their lunch menu as would turn out. The bar tender was a super friendly young guy with thick beard and long hair. A very nice smile and up beat personality, he made some lovely drinks too. We wound up having a bean burger sandwich and a fried chicken cutlet sandwich. Both came out after a small wait but we had no cutlery....which soon followed. The bean burger was tasty and were really happy with it. The chicken sandwich, not so much. It was under-seasoned and quite honestly it was at mere room temperature. The thin cutlet was overwhelmed by the bun and simply failed to impress at all. I was a bit let down. The waitstaff handled it well and i quickly asked for a basic burger and continued to munch on my fries.....which now a couple hours later I wish I hadn't. So about the fries; Gordon Ramsey says over and over the key to french fried potatoes is uniformity of the cut because if they are not uniformly cut they they come out over fried and under fried. The slices of potato dont fry at the same rate when they are sloppily prepared. I also suspect the frier was not hot enough because they absorbed too much oil. Gordon Ramsey's words, not mine. But true indeed the fries were sloppy, oily, and heavy. The burger came out eventually and it was fine. Thats all, tasted fine. So we're getting ready to leave but strike up an enjoyable conversation with the bar tender asking questions about different drinks etc and an old couple come walking in carrying supplies of some sort. The man walks back in the kitchen and the old woman comes back behind the bar with out greeting anyone. The owners I figured. So while we're chatting with the bar tender the older woman who I am guessing is the owner is fussing about behind the bar, taking visual inventory, looking displeased, fussing about some more, critical stares at the bar tender, the bar, the shelf of liquors etc. We sort of acknowledged to the bar tender that she was back there and he turned to address her and she just starting asking him questions, giving him direction again not with the friendliest tone about her. And poof, just like that our rather enjoyable conversation was over. Done, gone, buh-bye, dont let the door hit you on the way out, OVAH! I found it rather rude they she'd just walking in, kill the mood, not acknowledge a single customer and literally interrupt a conversation we're having with her bar tender. It was just damn strange and something I have never seen before. So much of the restaurant business is show business and making your guests feel welcomed and comfortable. Whoever this woman was could do well to respect that in my opinion. So in short, funky decor, great bar, interesting menu poorly executed and not a fun inviting gracious environment that I am eager to revisit anytime soon.",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"

The fries were really good. The crab seemed to lack salt or something and didn't really go well with the sweet onion bun it was on. I guess I'm just used to some good old remoulade sauce or something since we are from Houston and the seafood is heavily influenced by Louisiana. My husband had nachos with beef. It has raw jalapeños but we're used to pickled ones. And he beef had BBQ sauce on it which we've never seen before. So I put the crab on one of his nacho chips and piled on the pico and queso and it was awesome, haha!

We told them we wanted to share the beet salad to start and then the Cajun burger without tomato cut in half. Beet salad came out first and it was tasty and a nice portion to share. This would fill up someone for a full meal. Then they brought out the burger with the tomato we asked omitted and not cut in half as requested. Burger was good- cooked medium as asked and the beef was good quality and needed no extra seasoning. The fries that came with it needed salt (which didn't come on table) and included a mix of delicious fries and overcooked fries. Service was extremely friendly and quick,  despite the mistakes.

There isn't much around but it is a block or two from the 9th street light rail in Hoboken, which is pretty awesome. They have recently started doing brunch or at least I recently found out that they did! I'm looking forward to going for that! There isn't a ton of seating, and they do play live music. If you are trying to catch a show it gets pretty crowded. Just a heads up, be prepared to stand around or get in early for a seat.

The female owner walks around like a Nazi which definetly reflects on the staff as they also have the personality of a fish out of water.

All of our favorites are gone.  This used to be our go to location after work but I doubt we will ever be back.

We went on a Saturday evening and there were plenty of tables open. The bartender immediately came to our table and we ordered a beer and San Pellegrino Limonata. We were brought the correct beer but a large bottle of sparkling San Pellgrino water instead of the can of Limonata. We told them we wanted to share the beet salad to start and then the Cajun burger without tomato cut in half. Beet salad came out first and it was tasty and a nice portion to share. This would fill up someone for a full meal. Then they brought out the burger with the tomato we asked omitted and not cut in half as requested. Burger was good- cooked medium as asked and the beef was good quality and needed no extra seasoning. The fries that came with it needed salt (which didn't come on table) and included a mix of delicious fries and overcooked fries. Service was extremely friendly and quick,  despite the mistakes. Prices were a little steep for the neighborhood and music was a bit loud for 5pm. Look forward to trying out their brunch menu.",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"

One of our new neighbors recommended we check this place out for burgers, and I'm so glad my boyfriend and I did. We're huge Left Bank Burger Bar fans (in Jersey City), and Fox and Crow is being added to our list for amazing burgers. We sat at the bar, and our order was taken immediately. We were given a water carafe, which instantly made me happy because I drink a ton of water and hate waiting forever (especially at a bar) to ask for a refill of water. We engaged in some small talk with the bartender, who at first came across as lackadaisical but eventually warmed up to us. Dan (I believe is the bartender's name) told us about their daily happy hour (5-8pm), $5 beers and $2 off cocktails, the back room where they have live music, open-mic night, and he gave us his recs for the brunch menu.We watched both bartenders create intricate cocktails; they spent a good 5 minutes crafting these babies. The bartender even smoked wood when creating an old-fashioned (I didn't even know that was a thing...!). While we only had water with our food, I'll definitely come back to try some of their specialty cocktails.I was way too hungry to stop and take one before diving in, but both burgers were served on eclectic black and white splash-painted plates with ample servings of fries. We had the Cajun and Spicy Crow burgers. The bartender had both of our burgers cut in half before they served it to us because he thought we might want to share (I got the Cajun burger, my boyfriend got the Spicy Crow), which we did. These burgers were mouth-watering good - Left Bank Burger Bar, watch out! I didn't think I could find better garlic aioli dipping sauce, but Fox and Crow have it down pat. 4-stars for great food, cocktails, and prompt service.

Over all good flavor and a lot of food. Came with the pub fries and those were also huge. My fiancé had the krabby patty, he wasn't to crazy about it and I knew he wouldn't be Bc it had people cabbage and he's not a fan of cabbage. He did enjoy my burger. We also had the sweet chili wings, those were really nice and we enjoyed them.Only thing that was annoying was the service was really slow. The bartender was bartender/ bus boy/ server, so it is understandable that it would be slow. But when we got there, it wasn't too busy . It got busier later on towards the end of our meal, and service got slower. You can tell he tried to accommodate us and that's appreciated. He just needed some back up.

Late night: I came with some bartender friends who were attempting to engage our lone bartender on an empty weekday night. He wasn't feeling social. The drinks are decent, but not worth the aggravation.Dinner: I had a burger, it was barely ok. I asked questions about the drinks on the board and then bartender suggested I have something basic.

Only a matter of time until this place blows up and becomes a local fixture. They've got a really diverse selection of tap brews and I ended up going with a Carton Brew 077XX. The menu mainly features various burger selections, but if you don't fancy meat there are other between-the-bread options like crab cakes and a black bean burger. I went with the classic cheeseburger. No thrills, no frills- just meat, cheddar and caramelized onions. Exactly what I was craving- nailed it. The BF sprung for the black bean burger with avocado, a bit out of character for him to take the veggie route, but he ended up finding a new fave. Both of our burgers came with a side of fresh cut fries. They were thick, crispy and salted to perfection. A tad oily for a 10 pm dinner, but hunger was calling.Food was decent, but there wasn't much to choose from. Burgers at 14 dollars a pop or a beet salad are the only moves you can make here.

My friend had the crabby burger, she's a pescatarian, and finished it all as well. She did mention that it was a bit salty but that didn't stop her from enjoying it. My other friend had wings and fries. The house cut fries are good. Their chipotle mayo and paprika aioli are really tasty too.

After our ""meal"" and two beers the bill was $70. Sorry, the burgers, wings, and beers were not worth it (especially since they didn't have PBR) and won't be walking into that again.

Have only been once for brunch but plan to return to sample their further offerings.  The brunch menu was standard fare with a signature twist.  Despite the more adventurous dishes I decided to keep it simple with the the hamburger which, with it's blend of unique flavors, was a step above. If I had any criticism it'd be the burger was so stuffed it broke apart in my hand (however my girlfriend decided to cut her's in half which made it more manageable so perhaps that would be a way to mitigate it).  Fries were a wide cut, typically I prefer a thinner cut fry but these were crispy so I happened to really enjoy them despite their size!Atmosphere and presentation was top notch as well, furthermore the service was efficient and friendly. Our mimosas were garnished with an orange twist and each refill was received in fresh glasses with garnish, it seems like many brunch places just fill up your dirty old glass I didn't realize what a difference a fresh glass makes!It looks and feels like a bar so my initial though when I walked in was that this was just a bar that wanted to be a restaurant.  With live music, brunch and a full menu it seems like they don't know what they want to be, however I sense this is a deliberate and thoughtful choice. The food and service can sustain and it is in a transitional neighborhood and with limited options so it's a welcome all encompassing hangout that should establish itself as a staple of the area!DAN APPROVED!",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"

I think everybody does. Every time I've been there the bartender has been overwhelmed, often also acting as a server, but the vibe is 'just be patient'. We came in once on a weeknight when things were pretty empty, and ordered burgers, and waited for quite a while before they brought them out. For prices... the cocktails are good and interesting, and I'm happy to pay for them. The beer is truly overpriced; the burgers are great, but also a bit pricy.

Best of all, the vibe is fun and pretty chill!I drank the Guinness Blonde ($7) and then noticed that they had a nice selection of ciders. Yay! Unfortunately, they were out of Krabbies so I ordered the Crispin cider ($7).I had just eaten so I didn't order any food while I was there, but my friends ordered the burgers with French fries (California and Krabby) and the beet salad. Everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their meals ($14). However, it took them awhile to get their food. I imagine the kitchen gets pretty slammed on Friday nights. The staff was apologetic about it and gave us updates. It would be nice if they had a slightly larger menu, but it's probably best that it stay this way since they seem to have a pretty small kitchen back there.When it was time to pay, there were no problems closing out my tab even though I was part of a larger group. Love that!Overall, this is a very happy addition to the Heights for me! It's so nice not having to schlep myself to downtown JC or Hoboken.

Unfortunately, we arrived at 8pm so we JUST missed happy hour. Ended up seeing a couple of friends sitting at a table who was finishing up paying their check. Had to flag down their waitress a couple times. She must have been in the weeds because she seemed like the only server taking care of the whole section. My friends informed us in advance that the service was slow, but that the food was good.  I wanted to give this place a benefit of the doubt, but they were right. The minute they got up from their table, my boyfriend and I sat down and did not receive menus or was introduced by a waiter for almost 10 minutes. We saw 2 seats at the bar open up and decided that if we sat there, we would receive faster service.Was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender. I originally ordered ballast point but he suggested that I should try pineapple Sculpin --which was different, but in a good way! While my boyfriend ordered the cranberry cider which was served in a wine glass.I had ordered the Cajun burger (with avocado), the classic burger, and some wings to start off with. Our burgers came out, but what about our wings? Our bartender forgot to put it in which at the time was not a big deal. Maybe he wouldn't have forgotten if he wrote down our order instead of just memorizing it. Half way eating my burger, I realized that there was no avocado. I figured he forgot to ring that in too, didn't bother to let the bartender know. I was hungry and I was finally eating. The fries were OK, but my burger was dry. Did not know what to expect since he couldn't tell us the how their medium/ medium rare is like. Anyways, once we received the check, I noticed that I was charged for $2 for avocado that was never on my burger. Our bartender removed it but for 2 burgers (with a side of fries included) and 2 drinks, our bill came up to almost $50. This was very expensive and for the service that we received, it was not worth it.",Fox and Crow,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Burgers,, Pubs"

It's probably just because they're starting out but I can go at the same time 3 Saturday's in a row and one it will be open, twice it will be closed. I hope that becomes more regular.

A neighborhoody upscale, but super casual bar/restaurant? A full bar with about 4 signature cocktails, a great craft beer list and food. The food menu is limited mostly to burgers - think anywhere from a California style burger topped with avocado to a crab patty to a delicious veggie burger, all served with freshly made fries. I agree the $14 price tag may be a bit pricy for the neighborhood and value, but they are some damn good burgers. There were a few other options on the menu including a beet salad for those maybe not interested in partaking in a burger. I would love to see some more smaller/shareable bites, but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day.I went with the Shy Fox the whole time: spiced rum, egg whites some bitters maybe? Things got a little foggy at the end. They had their version of the Manhattan which was as someone put it ""booze forward"" and a few others. Many Craft beer options to choose from, including Six Point, that's at least what I had.A nice bar with a few booths and tables, not small, but perfectly intimate. The clientele was nice and neighborhoody. People know each other, people talk to each other... it's a thing. The music also added to the ambiance. I'm a sucker for anyone playing anything from the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.Service: Crystal, our bartender of the night was on point. I'd go back to see her. Can we be friends?

Then be prepared to flag down (with sinking ship-worthy arm waves) your server for anything else after the food is dropped: another drink, napkins, mustard, your check.

We turned our backs for 2 seconds and the bartender Greg grabs the balance of the money and throws it in his tip jar. When we call him out on it not only does he cop an attitutude, he tells us that it is our responsibility to keep an eye on our money and that whatever is left on the bar rightly belongs to him. WTF??? This is a local bar where you should feel comfortable enough to leave a few bills on the bar without having some punk bartender swoop in on it like a vulture.

If you want a real neighborhood bar where the owner and staff treat you like a neighbor go to The Corkscrew. Not to mention that you wont break the bank at The Corkscrew and the food is just as good.

I recall it being called Caribbean Nights. I am Caribbean only thing Caribbean was the word Caribbean Oh, and the pool table smack in middle, no swimming allowed. Now this place has been Re-named, Re-done and Re-claimed as Fox and Crow. Edgar Allan Poe would be proud. A well designed room is a place where every piece of furniture, every painting, and every fabric work together to create a harmonic space.  The designer has succeeded and creating this atmosphere with is balanced level of reclaimed wood and metal makes me a fan. I was able to visit here for Mod Cup's anniversary party last month. The Mod Woman Mannequin was front and center.   That night there was special Mod Cup coffee concoctions.  I am unsure if coffee induced drinks are available on the regular. The music had me dancing, which isn't too hard to get me to dance. The kicker is seeing other JC residents getting down and moving. It was a refreshing sight. This is all thanks to DJ Pastiche was there spinning a wide variety of music. Now, it did take me a while to get a drink, but I know this was the opening night and the place was super crowded. The Bartender was doing his best to control the crowd but at least give patrons ""the eye"" so I know I have been acknowledged.  I just had a couple of beers prices was a bit high, $7.00 average for beer.  Can't really complain, there is no place on palisades that is this cool and swanky.

There was a lot of love put into this burger, down to the bun being perfectly toasted on the inside, but not even a little bit burnt. The Cajun burger has crunchy onion strings in it, giving it an amazing texture. The whole thing was juicy, but not soggy. I'm pretty sure I'm going to eat this burger once a week at least.Beers: decent selection. They have 5 or 6 beers on tap, and more in bottles. I was super happy as an IPA drinker, as they have quite a few. My friend who likes stouts was not as pleased because her options were Guinness or Left Hand Milk Stout, but let's be real here, Left Hand is a solid option. I'm definitely excited that this place exists, and by the look of it, the neighborhood is too. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get a spot at the bar, but we did just in time for our food to come.

The music, ambiance, quaint back room, stage set up, and well made drinks make this place a gem for us locals. Jersey City needed a casual, chill, spot with a cool vibe to host great music and make great drinks and here it is. While this place doesn't try to pretend to be a speakeasy like many other spots do with a backroom and great drinks... this place is the quintessential speakeasy.  The service was a bit spotty in the back (we had to find the waitress to ask if we could sit and wave our hands around a bit to get her attention once or twice) but all in all it was fine. The backroom has some of the best music and drinks in the NY area. I have been here other times just to have a drink in the front room which is always comfortable and offers a quality beer selection including local beer.  Noise level in the front is good enough to have a conversation.

Written on the wall are a few specialty drinks and my boyfriend's eye went straight to for the Mod Fashion; a twist on the classic bourbon drinks. He loved every drop. We both ordered the Cajun spiced burger that came with hand cut fries. I was worried that the Cajun seasoning would be too much but it added just the right amount of flavor and the sweet bun balanced out the spice.

Live close by and have gotten take out or dined in and the food was always good, beers pretty good, bar staff - not so good.Ordered a burger to split with my girlfriend and after taking 2 bites each noticed that it was not cooked.  We ordered medium and it came RAW, not medium rare - RAW!  2 bites each of a half of a burger is about a 1/4 burger each.  So here's where this matters.  I show the bartender that the burger isn't cooked and tell her not to make another (although she didn't offer in the first place, just took it and walked away) and she comes back with the check with the burger still on it.  I've worked in restaurants for many years and every single establishment would take the burger off the bill.  It's not the $$$, it's the principle, plus we both could have gotten sick.  So now the bartender argues with me telling me I ate the whole burger when we did not and then calls the owner over who then brings my burger back out from the kitchen and digs her finger inside to show me that ""it's cooked"" when you could still see and smell that it was raw.  So she says to me ""in the burger world, this is medium"" burger world???  It was raw and obvious and even more obvious that she and her staff don't know how to deal with guests or know how to cook burgers.  Burger world?  She was in her own little world.  She eventually took the burger off but the damage was done already so it didn't matter. So in the end they just lost guests that have dined there multiple times and still would have but now will NEVER GO BACK!!!  For a measly $2 dollars worth of product/food they could have kept guests that have been dining there and saved a horrible review.

But I had the worst service experience in there recently. I'll try to give the short version: they have two cocktails on the menu, a Shy Fox and a Sly Fox, and they are wildly different drinks. I ordered the Sly (I believe) and got the Shy... the first was sort of Manhattanish, and the second was made with egg whites and rosemary. We were there with our two kids and a friend and her daughter, and it was about 6 in the afternoon, not many folks around. I had a few sips of the drink before I wondered what I received. Then, not wanting to cause trouble, I decided I would drink the thing. A few sips later I was really not enjoying the drink and told the bartender that I got the wrong drink. She told me she was going to charge me for it as she dumped it into the sink right in front of me. I said, ""WAIT!"" if I'm paying for it, let me at least drink the thing. She said I drank almost all of it and so she was charging me for it, ""it's about my liquor cost."" she said. This is on a $12 cocktail, mind you. I got the correct drink and it tasted like there was toothpaste in it. I don't know if she put something in there to be cruel, or if I missed peppermint as an ingredient, but both of those drinks were terrible, if you ask me. And they're the signature drinks, I should guess. Eh. Stick with a draft cider or something if you're in there and manage to get a drink. Anyway, poor form to say the least. I reached out to the owner to discuss it with him or her, and got no response. I've mentioned it to a few folks and they've all agreed that the service was sub-par. I'd call it hostile, but that's just me. Anyway, this place can suck it. I shan't bring my dollars there any more. PS: after all that b.s. they didn't charge me for it.
