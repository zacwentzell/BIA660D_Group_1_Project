2,thgGRLa4-OPmLD6hrnMGPw,Nick M.,4.0 star rating,"Upholstery is an interesting spot. Excellent found, great presentation, a chill atmosphere and a unique selection of wines and cocktails make an overall excellent dining experience. Where to start?Upholstery is a small, somewhat cozy spot. While they do seem to have some areas that would accommodate larger groups, it's style is really best appreciated in 4 or less (or or a romantic evening). The seats are comfortable, the lighting is dim and intimate and the music is fantastic, a real mix of eclectic indie rock/electronica/jazz (is there a name for that genre?). Food wise, everything we had was amazing. I cannot recommended enough the lobster and avocado deviled eggs, Tasty with lovely presentation. One thing to note, is you do get 2 of each kind, the avocado and lobster are not mixed, for the better. We also had the lamb and the squid ink fettuccine. The lamb was tender, cooked excellently and mixed with a kind of dark bbq sauce and mushrooms. Everything was tasty if tried separately on the dish, but if you mix them together in a bit, the variety of flavors blends amazingly and makes you want more. Cocktail/Drink wise, everything was excellent and quite different. We tried some wine and the Johnny Fashioned-Seed. It was a nice mix of flavors with a smoky finish. I was not expecting it from this drink.Overall, Upholstery was a great dinner and fantastic dining experience.

I made a reservation here through yelp for 5 the night before NYE strictly because it was one of the few restaurants without a prefix NYE menu that still had availability. It ultimately ended up being a great choice. I would say my actual experience was more of a 3.5, but I'll round it up. The service was extremely slow and that irked me. I didn't want to spend my NEW YEAR inside, but that  ended up being the case because everything took so long. Our drinks took 15-20, food took 40+, dessert menu was forgotten after multiple nods to our table, the dessert itself was another 30+. The waiter was working one side by himself, so I can sort of give him that because he was never around without us flagging him down. But then, we were the only table on his side of the restaurant - everyone else was just at the bar and there was a bartender there.. so....But the food is PHENOMENAL. The portion is disgustingly small for the price tag though. The lobster roll looked smaller than a hot dog bun and the lobster itself was less than that of a hot dog. But it tasted great. The grilled octopus is a must get. I loved my linguine with clam sauce. My friends all loved their dishes (flounder with cauliflower purée, grilled hanger steak, trout with pumpkin purée, squid ink pasta with coconut cream sauce).

Plus: venison accompanied by pickled blackberries? You'd never imagine them going together, but it was heavenly. And Andrew the bartender took fantastic care of us.

70,tEFHf4m6BLybEHiBLoJytQ,Pat W.,2.0 star rating,"Well, let's just say that The Upholstery Store should stop serving food, and maybe actually sell upholstery instead .  I REALLY wanted to like this place, and I'm actually not that picky, but my gf & I were very disappointed with our meal.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the place has great ambiance, a nice selection of music playing, and the noise level was minimal  (I hate when a restaurant is so loud that I can't hear the person sitting next to me). Additionally, the waitstaff was very informative, attentive, & friendly (we tipped well because they of course bore no responsibility for the lackluster quality of the food). Now to the food...We started with the octopus & a radicchio salad. The octopus itself was the most flavorful part of the meal & the portion size was quite good; however, the accompanying elements (endive & grapefruit) seemed haphazard, and disparate providing no cohesion to the dish.  The endive salad had potential, but severely lacking in blue cheese (literally, I think I got 3 small pieces of blue cheese). Now I don't expect, nor want my salad drenched in blue cheese; however, if the dish is described as having blue cheese, then I do expect more than a tiny smattering of the cheese.  As for presentation ~ there was none. Basically it was chopped radicchio, with a few walnuts thrown in a  bowl. For our entrees...My gf tried the shrimp with spinach & mushroom dish. Again, no presentation. The ingredients were simply thrown in a bowl. The dish was quite bland. How hard is it to infuse some flavor into shrimp? My gf seems to be able to accomplish this whenever she makes us a shrimp dish at home (and she is far from a trained chef). I had the Arctic char. I LOVE Arctic char, but I truly couldn't love (nor even like) this dish. I'm not even entirely convinced that the piece of fish served to me was actually Arctic char. The fish was served atop a strange puddle of cream sauce that was wholly unpalatable. Thrown under the fish were a few soggy pieces of cauliflower. Sitting on top of the fish was an odd, puffed rice thing that was too salty to consume. Needless to say, neither my gf nor myself finished our dishes. Just SO disappointing, & SO expensive. Certainly I wouldn't have minded the expense had the food been enjoyable.

86,a1mZF9zFmg5VY9YOTFNzJw,Alexandra T.,4.0 star rating,"This wine bar/ restaurant/ cocktail bar is among the top spots in the West Village/ Upper Tribeca area to get appropriately-priced glasses of austrian and german wines, in conjunction with expertly-prepared small plates.  The dressed oysters are a bit of an indulgence at $7 for 2, but the accoutrements include caviar and uni, so you are definitely getting your money's worth.  The other food offerings include a cheese plate sourced from Murray's and some gorgeous sardines, grilled and plated with a vegetal puree.  The host, waiters and bartenders know their booze, and can easily recommend cocktails (anything with gin and creme de violette is good with me) or wines by the glass for any palette. If only there were more seats at the bar....  then again, there'd be too many people and the charm would be gone.  This is a spectacular neighborhood spot that just needs to be conscious of prices, and it will buy itself a local loyal crowd for life.",Upholstery Store: Food and Wine,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars"

I think the team might be Austrian which would explain the dry Liebfraumilch's by the glass and the raspberries in a spring salad. ""The hills are alive with the sound of music!""But really, this is a delightful, romantic place, perfect for a sexy date or cocktail. It's not too loud and the charming lighting makes everyone gorgeous. Plus you get to watch the chef and his team make spectacular (that squid pasta with coconut milk and bergamot!!!?

The atmosphere was very relaxed and surprisingly not loud or noisy at all. We ordered a round of cocktails- I had a customized cocktail off (if you order ""The Owner's Manual"") and it was delicious! The bartender was wonderful- he was very attentive and even came over to apologize when the drinks too a little longer than usual to come out. My friend ordered the Fairy Godmother which was tasty and refreshing. The desserts are also amazing- the chocolate pot de creme with just the right amount of salted caramel peanuts and the elderberry panna cotta.

Cute table in the back that looks out at a garden.Date Rating: 8Pick up Scale: 1 (definitely a neighborhoody/BYOF Bring your own friends kind of place)Strong Suggestion: have other plans nearby.  Try the chorizo tacos up at Automatic slims (they're tasty!) yelp.com/biz/automatic-s… (but slims isn't fancy just grab the tacos and go).",Upholstery Store: Food and Wine,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars"
94,-NTBTeBoI92WPuGpC6AdgQ,Mr. Voracity I.,4.0 star rating,"The Upholstery Store is one odd bird, and should totally be down in two-star land.It was actually a former upholstery store, but they updated the interior which, though small, manages to have several pockets of intimacy and really nice dark-but-not-scary lighting.   The wines are mostly Germanic themed, and by no means the best specimens of each varietal, but still they hit the spot.  And cheese plate has only okay cheeses but manages to fit the bill too.Basically, for no logical reason, I kinda love this place.  It gets nothing perfect, but charms it's way to true wine bar goodness.The gentleman running the bar knew his stuff, and was super nice and genuine.  In addition to wine, I had a sangria-ish cocktail, which was tasty, and one of the several cocktails that he cleverly named after upholstery (no joke), and I was totally charmed.I would totally give it a 5 star (which is rare for me), but the wines were only okay-good and the cocktail was more interesting in theme that reality.  Still, this is an awesome place for a first date or meeting one or two friends.  It is truly intimate yet still fun.VoracoMeter=6 (out of 10)",Upholstery Store: Food and Wine,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars"

Reminds a bit of the alley wine bars in SF.   We went late on a Sat. night and so it wasn't too many people but I can see the establishment getting loud quickly.  The bartender was great and the wine she suggested was right on for the evening.  The back get a bit loud with the music but the front is available for a pleasant conversation.  Dark and sultry.  A nice way to end the evening.",Upholstery Store: Food and Wine,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars"
