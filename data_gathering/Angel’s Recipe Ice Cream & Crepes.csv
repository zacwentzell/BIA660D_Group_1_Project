I have tried to refrain myself from picking up a half pint of icecream everyday but unfortunately I can't stop.. because it's that good! The white bunny (easter special with french toast icecream and cookie dough), Knocking on Heaven's Door 2 (vanilla, nutella, and strawberry), and Matcha Libre (matcha with red bean paste) are my faves. Usually when I go to a dessert place that I love, I end up getting the same thing.. but not here.. all the flavors are so yummy that you will want to keep going back and trying more.Pro-tip: the location is odd as it is right inside the gogi grill. But do not let that scare you! You can get korean bbq and icream at the same time! As for what I usually order, I love getting the half or full pint to take home.. but make sure to try the rolled icream as well.

The toppings are also really good especially the marshmallow that they toast with a flame. It is also really fun to watch them make rolled ice cream fresh in front of you.

This place is following the new dessert trend that's happening in NYC, the thai rolled ice cream? Its the first one I've seen in Hoboken, and its very reasonably priced i might add for the quality and quantity. I ordered the MATCHA LIBRE (cute ice cream names heh), which was green tea mixed with red bean, and ordered a green tea with strawberry combo too. They chop it up in front of you and roll it on the freezer plate. You can pick toppings and there's an array of everything from mochi to meringue cookies to nuts to even popcorn!! The guy working was very sweet and was so quick with service. I've been to places like this in the city and they're definitely a lot slower when making the ice cream and much more expensive. The ice cream was delicious, creamy and the combos were perfect.I would really recommend this place to anybody looking for a new dessert spot in Hoboken/Jersey City. Its an interesting new spot in the area and its definitely a photogenic, ""instagrammable"" dessert.

37,tCjYkKd3jxm5-QoGqJuQgQ,Kelly R.,5.0 star rating,Have I died and gone to ice cream heaven!? THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!!!!!! Thank god we finally have an awesome ice cream place in Hoboken. I have only had ice cream once from here but it's taking everything in me to not be here every day especially since I have to walk past it every night. I had the mint Angels and Demons Ice Cream. The process to watch them make it is so cool. They have a bunch of toppings but since there was so much ice cream I decided to pass. At first bite you immediately think YEESSSSSSS. It doesn't taste overly fatty like Coldstone and is much simpler than Ben and Jerry's.I can recommend this place enough! Go! You won't be disappointed.,Angel’s Recipe Ice Cream & Crepes,4.5 star rating,$,"Ice, Cream, &, Frozen, Yogurt,, Desserts,, Creperies"
38,kCF1JTsTUdz5f12e6eo9Ag,Grace S.,5.0 star rating,"Decided to try this spot out after dinner at Gogi Grill and it is AMAAAAZING!! New favorite dessert spot in Hoboken for sure. This place is following the new dessert trend that's happening in NYC, the thai rolled ice cream? Its the first one I've seen in Hoboken, and its very reasonably priced i might add for the quality and quantity. I ordered the MATCHA LIBRE (cute ice cream names heh), which was green tea mixed with red bean, and ordered a green tea with strawberry combo too. They chop it up in front of you and roll it on the freezer plate. You can pick toppings and there's an array of everything from mochi to meringue cookies to nuts to even popcorn!! The guy working was very sweet and was so quick with service. I've been to places like this in the city and they're definitely a lot slower when making the ice cream and much more expensive. The ice cream was delicious, creamy and the combos were perfect.I would really recommend this place to anybody looking for a new dessert spot in Hoboken/Jersey City. Its an interesting new spot in the area and its definitely a photogenic, ""instagrammable"" dessert. I would rate it 6/5 stars if I could :) will be returning soon.",Angel’s Recipe Ice Cream & Crepes,4.5 star rating,$,"Ice, Cream, &, Frozen, Yogurt,, Desserts,, Creperies"

My favorite crepe is banana with Nutella but I'm not here to talk about that crepe. I don't often eat savory crepes and I decided to try one that I might like because I could be a bit picky regarding the ingredients.

Each one of the flavors had a sour taste and did not taste like traditional ice cream and more like frozen Greek yogurt with a pungent sour taste.

My friend got the coffee ice cream as her base with Oreo toppings while I got milk chocolate with Reese  as the base and then topped it with the S'mores option.

We saw a sign outside for Rolled Ice Cream. My friends and I had never had some so we made our way inside to give it a try. First of all, the process is AWESOME! watching them roll the ice cream on the cold counter things was entertaining and cool. And the taste? Wonderful!

My matcha ice cream was amazing I couldn't stop eating it! All the toppings are free and unlimited which is awesome, other rolled ice cream places charge extra for toppings. Pricing wasn't​ bad either, it comes about to ~$6.50.

52,QuM8aeS6ozFa-CFVWCCv1w,Christina L.,5.0 star rating,"My family and I were strolling in Hoboken when we saw that there was a roll up ice cream place nearby. We've never tried rolled up ice cream and honestly wanted to see what the big hype was about and if it really lived up to the hype. My kids shared Angels and Devil which is vanilla ice cream with oreo with roasted marshmallow and sprinkles (of course)  while my husband and i got the fly me to the moon which was strawberry and banana with vanilla ice cream with roasted marshmallow and pocky sticks. I really wanted to take a picture but as soon as we got it and took a bite we all delved deep into the ice cream and at one point my kids fighting over who got the last bite. For $6 you can choose toppings of your choice no limit even without the toppings I'd totally just do the ice cream alone. My kids had fun watching it being made and rolled up which is a bonus because it keeps your kids quiet and anything that can keep them calm and immersed in something is always a bonus. Before we left we also had to take some more ice cream for the road you know that whole 20 minute ride is a long one, so we ordered French Toast to go and ugh it was perfect and I felt like I was eating breakfast while getting tiny micro cinnamon bites in between every spoonful. i'm so glad I don't need to pay for toll and go to the city for this type of ice cream.
