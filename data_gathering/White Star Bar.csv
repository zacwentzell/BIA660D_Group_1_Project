In the past several weeks, I've ventured to various diners/drive-ins/dives (or rather: restaurants/dives) to experience different burgers. With the guidance of a fellow burger connoisseur (as well as wisdom from a few other burger consultants), I was introduced to the glory that is White Star Bar.White Star Bar is nestled on a quiet corner in idyllic Downtown Jersey City. While many Yelpers have referred to White Star as a ""dive,"" I think it lands a notch or two higher on the multi-notched scale of dive-to-Michelin-restaurant. A true ""dive"" usually doesn't have farmhouse-style hardwood floors, candle-lit tables, nor overall cleanliness and classiness, and it especially doesn't have a well-designed logo or website. White Star wants to be a dive and I understand why; these days, a ""dive"" is synonymous to a less-trendy, lesser-known joint that serves up super high-quality dishes and drinks without the stuffy attitude of being a trendy, known joint. In all the best ways, White Star is everything a dive bar is and isn't.The fried pickles (served with a delicious chipotle mayo) and nachos are great to get the meal going (whatever is going on in that stack of nachos is the work of a genius, I'll tell you that much). I ordered the Purple Rain (Honoro Vera Rose, Tito's, Chambord, blackberry, mint, lime), served with a delightful hibiscus flower picked in Hawaii and shipped straight to Jersey's favorite zip code 07302. But the cheeseburger...The Double Burger Double Cheese knocked me out of my senses with ooey-gooey American cheese and a killer secret sauce on a bun festooned with more sesame seeds than the number of times I can say ""this is one of the best burgers I've ever had"" and still mean it.White Star Bar proves that burger accoutrements don't have to be elaborate to be impactful, and neither do drink trimmings, nacho accessories, or overall dive adornments.

The vibe is always laid back and casual, the staff is always friendly and they have solid food and beverage options. This place also has one of my favorite burgers ever. I've ordered variations of their burger countless times over the last 4 years and it's never disappointed me dining in. There was one occasion years ago when I ordered a burger cooked medium rare for delivery and the inside of the burger was beyond raw- basically just uncooked ground beef. Not very appetizing. I have only ever ordered food to dine in since then and the food has been fantastic. Their brunch options are nice and they have a solid Bloody Mary. In addition to the burgers and brunch, I can recommend the wings, BLAT sandwich, bar pies, nachos, hummus, brussels sprouts, truffle fries and most recently the Brunswick Salad. I had this last night, swapped the dressing to their house Caesar, and it was beyond satisfying and filling. Beware of the weird sink in the restroom.

Pasta is so cheap, a bit more for $20 could go a long way!-Chicken Sandwich- great flavor BUT a bit on the dry side as well!-Nachos- something just wasn't right. The pulled pork had great flavor but they had such little toppings and was just missing something.We will be back but I wish they would improve some of the things above!",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

They've got two locations open in JC and a third on the way, so needless to say they aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Although I was in for brunch and the egg dishes all sounded great, I knew that I wanted a burger for my first White Star experience. They've got a separate burger menu and each burger is named after a different area of Jersey City which is adorable! I was happy to find out that during brunch you can still order off of this separate burger menu. After starting off with a round of bloodies and mimosas (priced at 6 bucks each) I ordered the Jersey City Heights burger. It was juicy and cooked perfectly with melty gruyere, sauteed onions, roasted peppers and garlic aioli. Definitely perfection in a burger, and I savored every single bite. I opted for a side salad over fries (lame move, I know) and was happy that I did. The creamy house balsamic dressing was so good. I also snuck a bite of the fried chicken sandwich, and no surprise, it was amazing. The chipotle sauce added great flavor and the cole slaw added just the right amount of crunch. The service here is quick and prompt and our waitress was so sweet and friendly. The rest of the staff was too. Throughout the meal other staff members who weren't even our servers came by to ask how we were doing. There's no way to go wrong at White Star. Great food and drinks with a cozy neighborhood vibe.

We initially wanted a place with outdoor seating but White Star has a decent amount of windows so when we came across it we decided to go in.There was a friendly atmosphere which did get a bit noisy (there was a rowdy crew toward the front) but hey, it's a bar. When our waitress (who was super friendly and attentive) recommended the Crispy Chicken Sandwich my friend took her advice and ordered it with fries. He was not at all disappointed and I will admit - seeing the chipotle mayo ooze from that thing definitely made me a little jealous.I went with their Blackened Chicken Salad which I requested without the cheddar cheese. I'm actually just realizing now that it was also missing the avocado but since there's nothing I can do about it , I'm going to assume it was just an oversight. The salad was a decent portion and they were generous with the amount of chicken -- unlike a lot of establishments these days, so I too was satisfied with my meal. We each had a beer, my friend got an IPA and I got the Brooklyn Lager. Our bill came to $40 (not including tip) which is standard considering the area I suppose.I can definitely see myself coming back for a few drinks!

The ambience is casual while also being very intimate. I loved the nice rustic feel of the restaurant and the the little touches like the flower and candle on the table were beautiful. I started off by having the Mexican corn, which I believe was on special, and it was absolutely delicious. You get 3 pieces of corn on the cob and it is smothered in sauce and sprinkled with cotija cheese. I would highly recommend this if you see it in the menu. As my main course I had the roasted chicken with the Yukon mashed potatoes and veggies. The veggies were good and the chicken was perfect.  The skin was well seasoned and crispy and the meat just fell off of the bone. Unfortunately, I was not too crazy about the mashed potatoes. They were either instant mashed potatoes and just way too puréed for my taste. And the pan jus basically liquified them. I also got a strawberry cocktail that although was a little pricey, $12, was amazing. It was very flavorful, smooth and was still able to taste the  alcohol which means there was a good amount in there.  As for the service, my waitress was superb. She was very attentive and fast. However, she was not very engaging, which I didn't mind all. I just know that as a waitress myself, many customers like to have conversations and she didn't seem like the type. She was primarily focused on getting my order quickly  and checked up on my table often to make sure that everything was going well. Overall, my experience to White Star Bar was amazing and I would highly recommend going there if you're in Dowtown JC!As an FYI, they either didn't give me a dessert menu or they don't serve it.

61,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,4.0 star rating,"""That might be the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten in my life,"" said my boyfriend.Which I thought was crazy at first. Sure, the the chicken breast was fried to golden perfection and cooked just perfectly. Yes, the cole slaw was crunchy and refreshing. And perhaps the chipotle mayo did complete the sammie. But was it really the best? I started making a quick mental list of chicken sandwiches that I've eaten in my life and nothing really memorable came to mind. So I slowly came to the realization that this too, might just be the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten in my life! I feel like it should be featured on the Food Network's, ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"".And to think, I was originally going to change my order to a burger. Good thing I didn't! My boyfriend ended up ordering the White Star burger since they ran out of the ribeye steak sandwich he wanted. I had a bite and it was good, but nothing amazing. It was also pretty messy and it looked like he was having a hard time eating it (then again, he did add a fried egg to it). But even he said he wished he ordered the chicken sammie instead, after trying mine.We also ordered the bacon mac and cheese. It was cheesy and creamy, just how I like my mac and cheese. The bacon wasn't regular bacon - it tasted more like a ham, which wasn't a bad thing, but I think I would still prefer good ole' American bacon. Service is kind of spotty. No one really greeted/seated us once we got there and it took a bit to get our menus. Also, it's really loud in there - which is expected, since it is a bar and all. So if you're looking to have a conversation with someone, this isn't really the place to do it. But if you're looking for some great (but not so good for you) food, then White Star Bar is your place!P.S. $6 Guinness all day? Whaattttt?

However I'd end up going with the White Star burger, as my fandom of menu items titled after their business is greater.First thing I noticed walking in was a sign that stated the kitchen is open til midnight EVERY NIGHT! Many bars have kitchen closing times that vary throughout the week, so I knew this place was already getting a star added on to it's final rating. I didn't expect the decor too be so romantic, so yes this is a great place to bring a date for evening drinks. Dimly-lit, with candles throughout, and the cocktails are great. However, as is the case due to my terrible love life, I found myself in another nice date spot with my male friend Billy. But Billy is a fellow burger connoisseur, and we'd soon be setting up a double date with two mouth-watering burgers. I placed bacon and avocado on my White Star burger, much like a romantic and wealthy gentleman would place mink on his date's shoulders at the end of the night. But I'm against animal cruelty, nor do I want this review to edge any closer to metaphoric-eroticism. So in short, Lucky Star Bar is a nice place with great food and drinks!",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I ordered on seamless for pickup thinking I could get it from the other location. I go there, and they tell me that pickup comes from their Brunswick St location. I was pretty devastated as a prego woman with one kid asleep- hungry with no ability to really get over there. So i call the Brunswick street location to request delivery, and as I started to explain my mistake- before I could even ask- the person on the phone was like oh no problem- i'll have it sent for delivery- what's your address. And it was here 7 min later. The burger was awesome, the chicken sandwich was delicious and the customer service experience just elevated the whole interaction.

After a few more visits, I can say that I've grown a likeness for it. It's a really cool neighborhood friendly bar that has a lot of character and personality. Very chill and laid back, expect a great time here with friends every time. The crowd overall is great and made up of mostly friendly, unpretentious locals. Staff is very personable and service is always attentive yet never annoying. They have a good selection of drafts and daily plus weekend specials on cocktails and food. When it comes to draft, I go for the PBR. For cocktails, the regular margarita on the rocks is a bonafide hit. I can't say this for a lot of pubs, but the food here is tasty. The White Star burger with shoestring fries, a safe and sure bet on the menu, is pretty good. I have yet to try it, but I hear their Mac & Cheese is delicious, so definitely something to consider. The quantity of food is pretty sufficient. Pricing is average. One of the features of this bar that I've especially come to appreciate is the artwork which they adorn on their walls. They feature different artworks from various local artists. Last time I was here, they had Pop Art/comic inspired art on the walls (see photos), and how I do love some good Pop Art/comic art. If one pays attention, there's always something new to see on the walls here.Overall, great neighborhood bar of Jersey City. The atmosphere plus the crowd add up to a bar that is always happening but not obnoxious. Plus, they might have renovated the bathrooms because they are super nice, fancy, and clean.

Crowd is always low key but diverse.  Absolutely love the atmosphere and decor and the music is always on point.  Food is more than decent, not in the league of some other 'gastro pubs' but more than solid.  Throw in that the food is very reasonably priced and they do specials like $6 'cheap date' dinners on Wednesdays and what more could you ask for?    Okay, so maybe the $8 beers and $11 cocktails could be a buck or two cheaper for a neighborhood bar, but you pay for quality and this is it.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Well, once or twice a month, which pretty much makes it the #1 spot we order from locally.Great food. Don't be afraid to order something just b/c it's a bar. You won't find me ordering fish tacos or whatnot at a normal joint, but you can tell this place takes pride in the quality of food they serve.First off, the burger. This burger is THE EXAMPLE I give to people of why I think McDonald's should be dead. I feel like standing outside of the Mickey D's line with White Star burger samples and asking people to compare. I just don't get it. You can go to Mickey D's, spend $7.50+ on a dbl quarter pounder with fries, eating something vaguely promised as ""now made with real beef,"" or you can come down to White Star, and eat 8 oz of Pat Lafrieda beef (the best meat purveyor in the country) on a Balthazar bun (also needs no introduction) cooked PERFECTLY how you order it, with a delicious side of fries....for $9. So now that I devoted an entire paragraph to the burger (end rant about why people still eat fast food) I don't really have much room for other food, but you can't really go wrong here. We're not big fans of the mac and cheese but it's not bad. It can kill the craving. To people getting delivery: I see complaints online about the food being cold or burger consistently being undercooked. We have ordered at least a dozen times for delivery and I don't think we've had cold food once. The burgers are normally either cooked perfectly or slightly undercooked, so if you are worried, order it done a little more than normal. Also to these people: Do you normally order burgers via delivery? White Star isn't perfect but they do it better than anyone else. The fries are never soggy.

128,Hrd2nKT0JbSsTUoWuSlBVA,Yves V.,4.0 star rating,"White Star Bar brings a little bit of that Brooklyn hipster culture into Jersey City.They say you should never judge a book by it's cover. I think the same applies for bars because I definitely underestimated this place. I ordered the namesake 'White Star Burger' and could instantly see why this restaurant receives such great reviews. The patty was thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly to how I asked. Burger enthusiasts will not be disappointed. The side salad was a nice portion size and tasted fresh. Can't go wrong with a combination like that.I feel like White Star Bar tries really hard to sell the vintage look, but many of their furniture pieces are just flat out old and beat up. Ripped leather seats are not really my idea of comfortable. The rest of the bar looks pretty cool though. There's plenty of art pieces on the wall. The bathroom is incredibly small. It almost feels like a closet that they converted, but it is very clean and surprisingly decorated well. Even down to the painted ceiling and rock counter top. Sitting in my collared shirt and tie from work, I felt like an outcast among the mostly hipster looking crowd. White Star Bar's atmosphere has its imperfections, but it does leave you with an enjoyable experience in the end.Great burgers for under $10? Sounds like a winner to me. The lamb burger is a bit pricier at $15, but if the beef burger is any indication of the quality, it will be $15 well spent. My party and I didn't order any drinks so I can't comment on that, but we all had a satisfying lunch for well under what we were expecting. It's pretty interesting to watch a bartender pull double duty serving drinks and food, but that's exactly how it went down during my visit. She served up drinks behind the counter and turned around and waited on us. She was pretty entertaining to interact with, which I would not expect from someone stuck doing two jobs during a lunch hour. She made sure our water glasses never went empty and cleared the table almost right after we all finished eating. I guess it didn't hurt that she was easy on the eyes too.Food: 4/5Environment: 3/5Price: 4/5Service: 4/5I'm very happy to have been introduced to this place because I will surely be back again.

I remember there being friendly and attentive staff. The service was decent but nothing that leaves a lasting impression. The tap water that was brought to the table tasted like what I would imagine sipping on the Hudson River chromium tastes like. Had to be a weird residue inside the bottles. The pulled pork was good. The burger had no flavor inside but was SATURATED with salt on the outside. It tasted like it was grilled on a flat top that was used to cure meat. The atmosphere was also super strange. I think I was the only woman in the bar, and it was pretty full. I guess sports are a big thing at this place.I'd recommend it, especially if you're hungry past 10pm.

We're not dating you.  It's awesome if you just take our order bring the food and eventually our check.  Being out and out blatantly rude is not OK.  Slamming our food on the table and snatching the plate out of our hands when we're trying to help you clear the table isn't going to get you more than a 10% tip (and that's gracious for the service we received).  We know you're just trying to make a living but maybe you should find a different line of work.,White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

But with excellent bartenders, food, regulars, and an owner who is dedicated to making this place one of the best in JC why wouldn't you want to spend time here?Every bartender brings their own special attributes to this place. They are a wide variety of people from many walks. All very friendly and fun to waste away an afternoon with. Not only are they fun but they also know how to make a drink and/or discuss the quality brews on tap.The food here, if you haven't heard yet is awesome. They already had one of the best burgers in town but then took it one step further and declared it the best in JC. Those who appreciate a good burger will agree with me. Don't worry non-animal eaters. There is a veggie option for you as well. They have some excellent wings as well. Same can be said for salads, tacos, dinner specials, etc...... you get the point. Pretty much anything you try here will be a treat.The atmosphere is indicative of the great neighborhood pub as well. Friendly locals who are more than willing to chat peeps up on a range of subjects. Art on the walls from local artists that are always changing and for sale. Lets not forget an owner who is always looking for a way to make your experience better. Everyone will have to admit that this is a formula for a successful establishment.Now I know my opinion doesn't mean much. But everyone really should give this place a try.

She and I went there a couple of Friday's ago for dinner. This was our first time dining here, and we were exciting based on the reviews and the fact that we live 2 blocks away. We arrived around 8 pm, and quickly realized that we were part of a wave of patrons arriving all at the same time. We noticed 2 servers on the floor, and the bartender behind the bar. The outside seat area was full, but there were available tables inside.  We sat and were met by one of the servers with menus. So far, so good....We ordered some drinks but needed a couple more munutes to look at the menu.  It was busy, and we were not upset at the fact that it took about 10 minutes to get 2 beers. We are pretty rationale folks, and we knew it was the height of the dinner hours. When the drinks arrived, we begun to place our order but were promptly informed that one of the options my friend wanted was out for the day. She needed a minute, but the server left while she was looking.  Another 10 minutes went by before she returned.My friend begun to place her burger order. As anyone familiar with their menu knows, there are optional toppings that one can select. She began to describe the burger that she wanted. The server responded smugly repeating everything as if my friend's request was a chore. We had been sitting for over 20 minutes, and all my friend wanted was a burger with a couple of toppings. We didn't order a side of sarcasm with attitude. We immediately decided we'd take our patronage and money to another local restaurant with good food and friendly service.  Good food is important, but so is service. If I want NY prices with the lame, hipster NY attitude I'll go to Brooklyn. I have a question to the managers - why do you only have 2 servers on the floor on a Friday night? Clearly they were in the weeds.  No matter how good your food is, it isn't good enough if it's being served by jerks.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

We have been coming to this bar for 3 years and its amazing to see the transformation that took place over those years. We used to walk in were waitresses would great us with hugs and already have our drinks being made before we sat down. Knew us by name and always took great care of us. Now you get service every 30 minutes and the food and drinks take a really long time to hit your table.The one thing that this place needs to bring back are the friendly waitresses. Maybe overly friendly? Idk however it made you feel like you are home. Made you want to spend more time and money there. Not saying who they have there now isn't good, it just needs some help. 2 waitresses is a must. One was having a hard time and it made the food and drinks slower.The food? Impeccable. Seriously. Anything you eat will be delicious. Of course there will always be those JC hipsters who come out of hiding for a 5 star meal at a dive bar, or a NYC resident visiting Nj with unreachable standards. However the food is good. Hearty and made with love. The specials are usually very eclectic so its easy to find something you like. Fresh and piping hot. Only issue was time. Need to move the food out quicker. Its a must.The drinks. Want micro brews? They gottem. About 10-15 of them that change seasonally. Can't beat it. Feeling nostalgic? Try an old fashioned. Their bourbon drinks here are the best. (Apple crush, peach cobbler, old fashioned) from simple to complex they have fresh garnishes and good pours.The music is always good. We drive 45 minutes to come here one way. It's our secret ""date"" spot. And with good reason. I don't order delivery because well thats too far so I couldn't tell you what the story with that is.

On a Saturday night at 6:30pm, the restaurant was empty. I think, ok perfect they'll get my order just right. I ordered the white star burger, no toppings, medium well. The burger came out warmish, not quite hot. There's a nice seared crust on the outside but it was to the point where I feared the pattie was too done inside. My fear was confirmed when I took a bite, and a second one (maybe it would get better towards the middle?) but it was just too dry and overcooked for me to enjoy at all! I had to put it down and I lost my appetite. Another person at my table also had the same problem but he ate it anyway. Maybe the chef wasn't paying attention to the cook time and let it sit on the grill too long. It was a long while (15-20 mins) before the waitress noticed that my burger was barely touched and asked how everything was. I told her the burger was too well cooked to eat and showed her, and she offered to bring me another. After weighing the risk of having a vandalized burger vs not giving the LB contestant another chance, I gingerly accepted the offer to have it redone. Honestly I've never sent food back before this instance because of all the true horror stories about spitting in your food, slathering it on the floor, etc. But there was nothing else I could do! It took a long time and the others at my table had finished their meals by the time I received my burger, this time done right. It was juicy and hot off the grill, but I must say I wasn't impressed with the texture. Sorry but I don't think I'd return.

It's a little bit out of the way, it's just bar food, I already have my dive bar I like, the excuses go on.  That sort of close minded thinking gets you to where I am now : ""I can't believe I haven't been to White Star Bar for a hangover helper brunch until now."" The Bloody Mary was super strong and spicy (yayer). So flavorful, with strong horseradish flavor, which I do love but alas, no accoutrement. I actually saw another gal drinking the Bloody and hers had a celery stalk, so, they must have forgotten to drop one in. It's all good. Still a great Bloody but not the best in JC (still haven't found it). It was pretty busy on a Sunday, good music going on in the background, sports front and center on the ample tvs behind the bar.Onto the ""bar food"".  It is bar food but, it was good. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito with egg whites. It was delicious. I added a little hot sauce on that bad boy and I was stoked. Two thumbs up for NOT charging me for egg whites, I hate that shit. I didn't love the breakfast potatoes. Sorry White Star, they were super oily and not crispy enough for my liking. My man ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and it was really good - though I enjoyed my burrito way better.  Again, this isn't knock your pants off fancy dining but if you need a laid back spot, where you can wear your jeans and a hoodie and devour some food while enjoying a drink- White Star is a great option.  *** The two girls next to me were eating what looked like a bacon and avocado sandwich and it looked Amazing (yes, with a capital A)***",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Unfortunately, delivery took nearly an hour although I live 10 blocks away. Regardless, the sandwiches and fries we ordered were ridiculously good albeit lukewarm. Figured we'd be better off just walking over to the place and checking it out, so we went on Saturday evening. The place has a really cool vibe, plus outdoor seating, which is my favorite thing about going out to eat in the summer. Lots of tap options and reasonable prices. Try the BLAT sandwich!

They not only constantly sent me different food than what ordered, but they also were constantly rude about it. My last order was in a carry out container that was not sealed, so when I opened it, all of my food fell to the bottom of the bag, when I called to explain the issue, they literally told me ""that is impossible, you are lying""By the way, it was the manager/owner who accused me of lying.  Worst treatment ever.  Apparently the customer is always wrong.  Too bad, I loved the food there.  Would have continued to order if I had not been treated like a criminal for not accepting bad service, and yes, the bad service was CONSTANT, like they deliberately wanted to make me upset, because otherwise it was freakishly bad mistakes. I am writing months after the last incident because I was thinking about ordering from them & just remembered all of the reasons why I had to stop ordering from White Star.One more thing, when I spoke to the manager, he insisted I was the only customer who ever had an issue with their service, however, just reading some of the reviews here on yelp, I realize he was full of it, and it was a real problem, not to mention that the bar staff admitted there were constant problems with the kitchen getting the food orders right.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

191,HpFquai0YtmLPvU69ww-Vg,Kerwyn V.,3.0 star rating,"A bunch of my local Jersey City friends said to go check out this bar, I tried to set aside my pre-conceived notions, but was unable to do that. When we came upon this diamond in the rough the first thing i noticed was the lack of signage, the close vicinity to a park, and the fact it was smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Parking was easy enough, thankfully since parking was opened up near the park, but I can see how the parking situation may be different for prime time nights (Friday/ Saturday). Despite these short comings it felt as though the expectations of this place would be high since it screamed indie dive bar from the outside. The Look: The inside decor was typical of a bar. The space was limited since this was located in a residential neighborhood, and the furnishings was not brand spanking new. If I were to give anything a low score on this review it would have to be the look of the restaurant. Thankfully that was not what made this place a diamond in the rough.The Service: When me and my party sat down, we were greeted by well dressed, well mannered, and cute bartenders. The bar didn't have any waitresses, but the amount of people that were there did not warrant such personnel on hand. We were quickly prompted for our drink order and our food order. We noticed that as time went by, more people came into the bar and the attention from the bartenders became segmented. Suprisingly though, the wait staff was able to handle all of the orders, and request from all patrons. The food orders came at a very timely manner, and was delivered by the bartenders.The Food: Looking at the menu, any patron can see quality ingredients are used at this dive bar. Brioche bread from Balthazar's bakery? Quality cuts for the Burger Meat that would be the equivalent in the city for twice the cost? The burger i ordered was delicious, with the addition of a portabella mushroom, it made the burger spectacular. The fries was good, but was more akin to McDonalds fries (which actually i like). My party also got some of the buffalo wings with our order. The wings were good, not spectacular compared to the burger. Definitely the best part of the place was the burger.My Recommendation: Go for it. Definitely a place to check out considering its location, and its food. Go during brunch and grab a mimosa and some eggs!",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

193,-_CjILp2BONVT99NQRwEsA,John V.,3.0 star rating,"Do you love quiet restaurants that aren't inundated by people who normally seek out places in popular sections of a city? Well, that's what you'll find with the White Star Bar that's located in a more scenic portion of Jersey City. Right away, you get that ""just around the neighborhood"" attachment with White Star, since it's literally situated around the neighborhood - the corner to be exact. From a cursory glance, you'd be hard pressed to even notice it there, mainly because of its subdued look. In fact, it could be easily mistaken for a house. However, that's where the beauty of White Star begins, as it doesn't try to stand apart from the neighborhood - so it's quiet and quaint.There actually aren't that many eating tables at the restaurant, but in the summer, there are sections that are available outside - weather permitting and all. Inside, the tables are a bit too close to one another in my opinion, seeing that I was able to hear the conversation going on at the next table. If you happen to be a beer person, you'll surely appreciate the selection that's available at the bar - plus, there are different specials marked at the front.I ate there on a Sunday afternoon, and at first, it wasn't too busy. However, after 10 minutes, it soon quickly became apparent that they seemed understaffed. Specifically, they just had one waitress manning the tables, while the bartender would help out every now and then. Well, we certainly didn't have any wait getting our drinks or food, but for the people next to us that came after us, they did do a lot of waiting.I ordered some buffalo wings for an appetizer and a Pulled BBQ pork sandwich as my main meal. As for the wings, they weren't anything spectacular, as they were fried to a crisp after thrown into a batch of buffalo sauce, To tell you the truth, I was hoping to experience something better, but it was more of the typical fanfare you'd get at ant place. As for the pulled BBQ pork sandwich, I was satisfied in how it came out. The portioning was great, as was the taste and presentation. However, I just wish that they added just a smidgen more BBQ to the sandwich, seeing that it felt just a bit dry at times. My sandwich came with an order of fries, which I have to say, they looked and tasted almost like McDonald's fries, which isn't a bad thing at all.Overall, I mainly enjoyed White Star for its laid back feel and style.

My stomach is growling and definitely the weather is just warm enough for a cold beer. So I search anything local for a quick bite and cold refreshment. Out of all the bars/restaurants in the area, White Star caught my attention. Across from a small park where they were playing little league games that day and kids out on their boards, I settled myself on the bar stool. Did you know what Wednesday is cheap date night?! chiching! $6 bar menu and liquid specials. Sounds good to me! Ordered the fish tacos, classic burger, and buffalo wings. Fish tacos - I usually am not a huge fan of them but I liked their version with the cole slaw and chipotle style sauce. Fish was fried but not overly battered. Nice. Classic burger - it is a solid burger. nuff said. (not on the $6 menu- but their normal menu isn't too expensive either) buffalo wings - butter and hot sauce coated wings. A little bit on the salter side but goes well with the beer. Nothing I'd make a drive for but enough to satisfy the wing crave. $3-$6 draft beer specials. It looked like they had about 8-10 on tap. Some local beers (saw some nj) and other generic beers. I like this place.

That being said, you can tell White Star puts a lot of care into making this veggie burger a delightful experience for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

My friend liked the burger, and the meat is Pat LaFrieda so you know it is good stuff. The fries that came with our food were crispy and had a lot of flavor but they tasted exactly like McDonalds fries. The resemblance in taste and texture was pretty crazy. My friend asked for her Bloody Mary to be spicy and apparently it was super spicy and excellent.

THey told me my card was already charged so they couldn't add the difference. I told them I didn't have any cash at which point she made it perfectly clear that if I didn't tell her right then and there I could come up with the difference, that my food wouldn't be delivered.The big problem wasn't that their menu was out of date, or that I was required to order something more expensive AND pay the difference in cash, but the fact that the woman was completely nasty about it really peeved me. I mean from the minute she called she was rude and sounded annoyed and inconvenienced. You know what? It's not my fault you don't keep your systems up to date.

The buffalo chicken anything there is so delish! I can't even begin to explain it. Especially the sandwich. The pizzas are made to order and thin. Good for an app. or a meal. The margarita is my choice. To accompany that, there are many flavorful beers on tap and plenty of sweet imports. Delirium Tremens, Red Stripe, All Chimays, Coopers, My personal favorite Hitichino White, and all the other usual stuff. Guinness is poured perfectly, and if Kelly's there, she can write her name on the head amongst other things. Owner is amazing and very accommodating to his customers.Like many have said. WS can get super busy during rush hours, ESPECIALLY for Wednesday night $6 menu. Be prepared to wait, but it's totally worth it. There are plenty of good eats to choose from on the $6 menu, and the regular menu. The place is small. So if you're not in a hurry, grab a beer and watch some sports or BS with whoever you're with while you wait. It's a great place to meet people, and pull a shift. The staff is great. There's only two people on at a time, and they handle the load just fine. If there's a problem expect a shot of Jamo and a smile, or a comped drink!*Stay away from the Chicken Parm unless you don't mind tons of cheese. Get the Chips and Quac, is made to order. Apple Brandy Chicken is flavorful and filling. The French Onion is just the amount of bad to go with the good, it's a must.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

If they still have it when you go there, I highly recommend the Brazilian Pork Stew which is absolutely everything it should be. They always have a decent selection of beers for $4 Wednesdays as well, and a couple of staple mixed drinks for cheap as well.It is, however, ridiculously crowded. There are generally three waves for dinner Wednesday nights, and I wouldn't suggest going there unless you're going early (around 5 pm), have ample time to wait, or are going by yourself. You will not be able to have an audible conversation with the tvs blaring, the juke on high, and everyone else trying to do the same around you, but the food is almost worth it.As far as the place's value as a sports bar is concerned, I think it's a little too arty and high-priced to be my local spot. Back before it was transformed into a sports bar, I thought the place had a lot more going for it. As a result, I haven't been there on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night in quite some time. Perhaps it's gotten better since its initial shift, but since the place is no big secret, I guarantee you it's probably packed to the gills on any major sports night, and it does not have the room to comfortably allow that to happen.The owner is good people, however, as are the bartenders.

White star bar is a cool little place that I received a delivery menu for back about 3 months ago. Thinking nothing of it I filed it with the others. After some time I realized I hadn't tried this place and decided to do so... WIN #1 the burger was moist and cooked to temp. The fries were crispy and in good proportion. I then proceeded to go to the bar the next weekend. WIN#2 the bar was lively the people cool the beers a plenty. and that's WIN#3 the beer list. ahh THE BEER LIST...

The interior is warm and inviting with a hip, adult feel. Some cool tunes playing on the excellent sound system. We noticed fairly quickly that the restaurant was understaffed as there was only one bartender and one waitress servicing the entire restaurant. We initially sat at the bar but the stools were so flimsy and uncomfortable that we moved to a table. Beer selection is excellent and listed on the menu with alcohol content which I always appreciate. Took quite a while for the waitress to come over and take our order, though. Beers were good. Bartender poured a perfect Guinness. Food was underwhelming and took 30 minutes to arrive. Not crazy slow but not a good sign, either. The waitress said they were known for their burgers but mine was a tad on the dry side and had obviously sat for a bit before coming out. Wings were very humdrum. Gummy without any kind of crust and comprised mostly of drumsticks. Brussel spouts were downright bad--rock hard and nearly impossible to cut without having them shoot off the table indicating they had been quickly prepared without steaming or some other method to soften them up . We looked around and only one other table was eating. Everyone else just came for drinks which is a great idea. The waitress and bartender were friendly and did their best so no gripes there.

350,NT6jJGO2VigcDr4_i_epXA,Katie T.,4.0 star rating,"Ate here last night as a little birthday celebration for a close friend.  We were both very pleased with our food and drinks.  I had the Three Amigos Quesadilla which only came with the quesadilla, sour cream and salsa.  I thought this will not be satisfying but it really was! The quesadilla its self was delicious, the sour cream fresh and the salsa had whole veggies and seemed home made.  Wonderful and filling!  I did burn my tongue with the first two or three bites but I can't complain that my food was hot right?  It was so yummie, I didn't care and I kept eating despite the pain. The Birthday Boy had some kind of chicken dish, Brandy Chicken I think.  Looked and smelled awesome at the end of the meal he sat back and said ""that was the perfect meal for today"".  Then we split the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie, damn this was good!  The waitress was friendly, engaging and polite, though she was a little slow to bring us the check, but I shouldn't complain she was working the whole place seemingly by herself.  Also it was nice not being rushed out of the place.  The only other complaint I have about her was that she was extremely pretty, which didn't bother me at the moment but had I been on a date I would have hated her popping over ever so often. Side note: Music selection When we first sat down I thought ""this is going to be a long night"" the first two songs played were some crap like the goo goo dolls and then to my horror John Mayer.  Someone in charge must have been thinking the same fight or flight kind of thoughts I was and changed the selection to 80's pop.  I specifically recall Billy Idol, Queen and the Police... much much better. Thanks for reading the vibe guys! We really enjoyed our night last night.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

353,2zw1sYyK5x32qcN9lbthGA,Sari J.,1.0 star rating,"When we first came here a few months ago, we were so excited about having such a great burger place in the neighborhood! We were beyond disappointed, though, when we went there Friday. The food definitely went downhill, and maybe it's because there's a new excutive chef (although shouldn't that mean the food will get better?). But on top of that, the service was awful! We came in at 5:30 and there was only one other table being served. Despite the fact that it was virtually empty, once we ordered we never saw our waitress again. And in order to get another drink, we actually had to get up and ask the hostess for our waitress. Our waitress never came, but the manager did, and then he disappeared after serving our drinks. The fish and chips were horrendous and inedible, and tartar sauce in a jar would have tasted better than what they provided The burger was not as good as in the past and the fries on all the plates tasted like they were fried with the fish. We had to wait again to find someone to pay the check. When the waitress finally arrived with the bill, we explained how bad the food and service was. She didn't seem to care about the feedback on the food and she said they were preparing for the evening (?) so her manager told her to stay upstairs and he was supposed to come down and check on us. They took the cost of a round of drinks off the bill, even though we never asked, but regardless we will never come here again and never recommend this place to anyone!",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

355,LOWVC6CWomtgaUqpUHgzhg,Christopher D.,4.0 star rating,I came to this spot late night to find some really darn good trance music blaring through the speakers. It felt like another realm. The lights were off and there were candles lighting the tables with a dim light on above the bottles behind the bar. I was totally intrigued by this after hours ambiance and throughly enjoyed all the beers they had. Although this place is a little small it is a very cool spot to just kick it.,White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

359,8E6pn-Q4NKrLDp3JQpS-Uw,Citizen J.,2.0 star rating,"The burgers are always very good here.  Some of the specials (change daily) are also quite excellent including their skirt steak and pasta dishes.  I usually order to-go or get delivery.  It's also a good sports bar but the music can be a little loud.  Most of the pizza in JC is of poor quality but Whitestar's is very good (and it's not even a pizza joint!).  Sometimes the pizza can be inconsistent in terms of how it's made (ingredients vary in amounts, etc) but overall the quality of their food is very good and a good value, too.As of 2013, their food seems to have slipped from 4 Stars to 2 Stars.  New owner?  New chef?  Dunno the genesis for this.  Alas, good restaurants typically have peaks and valleys -- and WS is currently in a valley.",White Star Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"
