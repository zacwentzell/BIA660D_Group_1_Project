I wish that there was one closer to me in JC, but for now the Hoboken location will have to do. Ironically enough I almost never order a burger. Their fried chicken is just way too good. I usually order the chicken on a sammie or keep things really simple and order the chicken fingers. This time I went with an order of the fingers. Although the price tag is a bit high for chicken fingers (12 dollars) the basket comes with enough to feed two people and a trio of dipping sauces - BBQ, ranch and horseradish. The chicken fingers are always extra crispy and golden fried to perfection. To drink I went with a strawberry lemonade. It was sweet and delicious and came in an enormous glass.  Bareburger never lets me down. The service is always pleasant and the food is consistently fresh and delicious. Between salads, sandwiches, burgers and sides there are plenty of options on the menu to satisfy all.

The fries were terrible, really soggy and cold; his burger was cooked just right and loaded with flavor, mine was burnt to a crisp. For the price I had high expectations but than again it was delivery. I would be happy to give this place another shot if I were to dine in.

I came here by myself on a Sunday lunch after spending some time writing. I guess I had different expectations for what a burger joint was supposed to be like ... FOOD: Per yelp's help, I got the bison burger + duck bacon + salad. The burger itself was smaller portion that I had expected, but itself was not bad! The duck bacon though, for that extra price, sadly, I found it not really that superior to justify the extra price charge. Maybe a mismatch of expectations, but I found myself wanting something else. The side salad was alright, nothing too special. SERVICE: A little odd as I was moved from table to another table due to some lack of planning of seating arrangements right as I was going to order. I also found it a bit slow too, but alas, it beats being rushed out the door.

As a burger junkie, I was excited to find that I could find this type of quality right near my house. The staff was super cool and helpful and the vibe of the place was chill. The selection of burgers and menu options were plenty.I ended up ordering the Bison burger (El Matador), with french fries and onion rings, and a white peace iced tea. For starters, the white peach iced tea was so refreshing and the onion rings were some of the best I ever had (although I don't often eat them). As for the burger, I was quite disappointed for a few reasons. There was far more bread than there was burger which is a burger ""no-no"". I have seen pictures for this restaurant that shows these huge burgers but mine was nothing like that. I was still hungry after eating mine and had to remove a ton of bread to get a taste of the burger. The burger was supposed to be medium and was probably medium well, which for a bison burger, really makes a difference. Overall, I was disappointed with my burger. It was certainly not even close to a #1 burger. It was very forgettable. Also, I asked for some of their special sauces for dipping and they told me I'd have to pay extra for it. This is strange considering I paid almost $13 bucks for a miniature burger. I don't mind paying good money for a burger but I want to make sure I get great value. Unfortunately I did not get it here.

This is happening with Bareburger. This evening I ordered and repeatedly asked - five times in fact and joked about it cause it sounded insane - a burger without smoke sauce. I explained the person I was eating with absolutely hates condiments of any kind and he won't eat it if it's on. The young woman on the phone repeatedly assured me there would be none. So it arrives and low and behold the burger is covered in the sauce. It took almost an hour to arrive and I'm embarrassed because my friend has nothing to eat. So I call the restaurant and the same woman answers and I ask her if she's been the only one taking orders this evening. She says no. OK, fine but it's her same voice. I explain to her the situation and she says it's a kitchen mistake. She can send another in 45 minutes to an hour. I've just paid close to $50 for two hamburgers, large fries and one soft drink. It's just not good enough for that price. I asked to speak to the manager and she says she's not there (classic move). My point is mistakes happen yes but to gloss over it and dismiss it when some is paying a fairly stupid amount of money for glorified fast food - well, it's infuriating.

I was torn as to whether I should give them 3 or 4 stars, a 3.5 would have been ideal, but I don't see myself wanting to come here that often or very soon so I went with the 3. Plus the prices are higher than average for burgers, but maybe that just falls into the how organic foods are priced higher?So I came here with my reluctant boyfriend, who's eaten here before but doesn't care for it much. I had the Wiki Wiki Burger ($11.90), which consists of wild boar, Gouda, duck bacon, chickpea onions, pineapple relish, and brioche bun. I liked my burger.. the boar was a surprisingly nice texture and the mix of flavors from the relish and Gouda really came out. I ordered a Banana Foster milkshake ($5.95, I almost can't refuse anything Banana Foster!). It was pretty good.. I tasted the banana and the caramel drizzle on the side of the cup. Very sweet though, but that's expected of a Bananas Foster treat.We also ordered a side of Rings and Fries ($4.70). The fried onion rings were really good and they paired well with some of the four dipping sauces provided. The fries were nothing special, but eating them with the organic ketchup they provided just killed it for me. I am a ketchup lover and I couldn't handle their ketchup. (Edit: Their ketchup is organic and I respect that, my palette is just too used to the ""un-organic"" ketchup and so I prefer that.) I kid you not, we ate a few fries and took the rest home to eat with our Heinz ketchup. Service was friendly and polite. The food just didn't give me any ""wow"" factor. And the prices kind of turn me away. Maybe one day if I go the organic route, I'd come more often. But for now..

Look no further. @Bareburger is a great addition to Washington Street for casual, healthy, yet indulgent eats. Prices are a bit higher than the norm, but eating high quality (and in some cases, exotic) meats and fresh, organic ingredients cost dough. The place is really nice inside - rustic wood tables and chandeliers make this not your typical chain casual eatery. They have a wide array of burgers already concocted for you ranging from elk topped with blue cheese and more, bison queso fresca and quac, beef topped with short ribs, fries and onion rings, to delicious sounding veggie varietals. None float your fancy? Make your own - pick your burger patty, roll, cheese and all the toppings. A few super awesome bonus l items I found - a goat patty, manchego cheese, duck bacon, and gluten free rolls! Those were just some extra's that just caught my eye.I was feeling a bit under the weather (read: hungover) so I couldn't go crazy. The Country Fare was perfect - bison, cheddar, tomato, dill pickles, lettuce and I opted for the whole wheat sprout bun. The burger itself was large - the patty perfectly sized (read: not too meaty). Bison is much leaner than regular beef - so I loved that there was a bit of fatty grease, but really not a lot. Everything tasted extremely fresh and of course delicious.Service was warm and enthusiastic. The burger ran about $11 and you need to order fries a la carte. In the end, you are looking at about $20 with a drink (no booze here) and tip. Not bad, but a bit pricy for lunch.They have burgers, sandwiches and milkshakes that looked miggghttty tasty as well.

The latest burger I had was good but different. They started using rice buns from a supermarket, but never changed it on the menu. That was nice to find out... Especially because I am supposed to be avoiding rice.From the toppings - duck bacon is my favorite (expect one piece of it on a burger for $3) and I am also a fan of their vegetarian options. The decor is fun. The walls are wood with a rustic look and the light pieces are made of spoons and forks. Really nice touch. The service was using - We ordered a bottle of water and the waitress didn't know if they served bottled water. She had to find out. I have to say that the burgers arrived quickly which was nice.Overall, I love the concept of the place and the food actually tastes good.

The standard comes with a sauteed onions, special sauce and pickles. I did not go wrong with this burger! It was really juicy and flavourful!The BF built his own burger, beef patty, tomatoes, fig sauce, cheese and something else I can't remember.

It came with two sauces, one was like BBQ and the other was like campfire (ranch & BBQ mixed).We also got the Pickles and slaw combo. The wasabi carrot slaw is not my style but the wasabi flavoring was very mild. The regular slaw fell flat on flavor. All 3 flavored pickles were unique and amazing. I ordered the Fire Cracka - which was VERY HOT! My boyfriend had to finish it for me. He ordered the Wiki Wiki and we ended up splitting the two burgers (the cook cut them in half for us which was great!). The wiki wiki was AMAZING. If a log cabin had a ""flavor"" this was it.

First I would like to note that when my group arrived, there were only a few patrons at the restaurant. My group waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, during which time the waitress did not come by once to refresh our drinks or check-in on us about our long wait. We all ordered vegetarian burgers by the way, so it wasn't because of food needing to be cooked well-done or anything of that sort. During this time, another group who came in about 5 minutes after us also grew impatient (they were waiting almost 40 minutes as well) and actually decided to just leave and go elsewhere. To add to the already terrible experience, one person in my party ordered a vegetarian wrap to take home when we had placed our order, and we found out after we finished our meal that the order had not even been placed. The waitress said it would come out in a ""few minutes,"" well, fast forward to another 25-30 minute wait (during which time the waitress never came back to update us) and the hostess had to inform us that it was still ""in process."" My friend just got his money back and the waitress barely apologized. It's a shame because the food is great, but because of the horrible customer service, I will not be coming back to this establishment.

But the problem was that the wait was much longer than we were told it was going to be. Who knew?

After discussing with my date and our lovely server, I went for the large Sweet Grazin' Salad topped with a healthy dose of buttermilk fried chicken. All the ingredients played nice together and felt fresh for the most part, but, nothing was cut into a manageable size. The apples were large wedges and the radishes, though thin, were big circles--not easy to bite. And the fried chicken might have been too spicy to go with the light salad.The boyf got the El Matador (his usual?) and he tried out the wasabi carrot slaw. The burger looked consistent to previous visits, but the carrot slaw was lacking the heat and flavor he was looking for.We ended our dinner with the Snickerdoodle Sammie. Once again, this was an excellent decision. I CRAVE this little ice cream sandwich.

The rustic homestead style decor of this hipster burger joint immediately conveys authenticity in its message of organic farm-reared food and it certainly delivers faithfully on this front.I ordered the 'Southern Caviar' bison burger, which with its country bacon worked well with the subtle kick of the horseradish remoulade. Together they reminded me of fresh breakfast farm food housed within the cosy confines of two soft and sweet layers of bread.To complement the main event, I ordered half rings and half fries. The rings were absolutely on point and could even contend for the best I've ever had with their crispy casing dotted with herbs, along with the soft and warm onion slice waiting inside. The fries on the other hand, although lightly garnished in visible salt crystals, were soft to the bite which wasn't incredibly satisfying for someone who prefers them crunchy. Paired with the Sir Kensington brand of ketchup and mustard, however, it was all very palatable: these sauces packed a punch with less sugar than the leading brandsSome small misses for me: having read others' reviews here beforehand, I was originally tempted by the grilled chicken; however before ordering, the waiter informed me they'd run out which was somewhat disappointing knowing that their business day had just started.The in-house lemonade was not so enjoyable as its bitter pungency was closer in taste to fermented ginger ale than a summery sweet and sour drink. Finally, even though I came for lunch at noon on a Thursday when there was plenty of seating available, and although polite and helpful with ordering, the waiting staff were laxed in their regularity of passing by the table.Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a thoroughly recommendable lunch place if you're looking for a healthier burger option in Hoboken.",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

We don't see the waiter for really long because he is talking to a table for over ten minutes, finally we tell the waiter and right away comes the food except it's ice cold- no exaggeration it was cold- the waiter apologizes and brings out two new hot burgers. He then comps the meal saying it was a mixup and won't happen again- so we forgive the place because anyone can have a bad night Now for the second experience- same thing we order our burgers except this time the waiter is being a little rude and seems very overwhelmed. But it's a burger place u don't go for the great service so we don't really care- I order my burger medium - it comes out raw- not rare bc I eat rare - I mean totally raw in the middle - I took a couple bites on the outside of the burger keep in mind before I get to the middle and realize how raw- (side note both times fries sucked completely soggy) you would think a burger place can get temperature right - I show the waiter he seems really understanding and says he will fix this.So I get my ""new"" burger - they took the partially bitten meat and threw it back on the grill and put that meat on a new bun. To me, that's disgusting so the food I chewed is on the grill with other burgers. I refused to eat the burger from that point and asked for the check and once again the waiter comps my burger but at this point it's over no amount of comps can make up for those mistakes You pay a premium at this place so you expect better quality and higher standards then u would at a fast food restaurant but this location honestly is horrible - I really hope they can turn it around bc I would be a regular customer",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

They also have sandwiches, salads, sides, and shakes; and are BYOB. Our recent visit on a Sunday evening a few weeks after they opened left me with very little to criticize in terms of food, atmosphere, and service. Our wait time ran about as long as promised and we were greeted by the ridiculously friendly waiter George a few minutes after looking through the menu. It can be a little overwhelming with the infinite choices of burger meat/veggie, toppings, buns, etc but this is one of those places where you have to tell yourself you'll come back again and just commit to something. I had the Buckaroo which had beef patty, brisket, aged cheddar, mushrooms, and smoke sauce on a brioche bun. It was surprisingly not overwhelming for me, which means big eaters will definitely want to fill up on sides. The brisket was a little dry and thin, which was ok on the burger but probably wouldn't be great on the brisket sandwich they also sell. Hubby had the Grindhouse, which is an elk burger with Manchego, country bacon (hubby swapped for duck bacon to maximize unusual animal consumption), and swapped pineapple relish for a fried egg. They offer ""sides"" or ""snacks"" and I'd recommend the smaller sides for only 2 people. The onion rings had a seasoned crispy breading and the fries were about middle of the road- medium thick, average doneness. We also got a tiny jar of dill pickles which were cool and tart to counter all the fatty fried meatness of it all. In the few minutes it took the waiter to come back after clearing our dinner plates I decided I didn't want dessert, but the ice cream sandwiches do look great so I'll try next time.

The burgers are maybe $1-$2 more than you would spend for a burger at most other restaurants in town, but that is to be expected since they are using superior ingredients.  We felt the prices were very fair for what we were getting.  The burgers were ample size (though I would have liked a little more meat), they were smothered with toppings, and the buns were excellent too.Their entire menu is full of items that are out of the ordinary.  From the cheeses, to the different types of bacon, to the bun selection, to the drinks (non-alcoholic), to the desserts, to the vegetarian options...you can tell they put a lot of thought into everything.  I had the ""Southern Caviar"" burger and my wife had the ""Wiki Wiki"".  We loved them both.They've done a great job with the interior.  When you step inside, you don't feel like you're in Hoboken anymore.  Maybe somewhere in the south or the midwest, but definitely not Hoboken.  Very few places in town give you that type of immersive experience.We were unsure about whether to get the ""side"" of onion rings, or the ""snack"" size which is much larger and double the price.  We're glad we went with the ""side"" because it had 6 large onion rings which was plenty for us.  If I have to nit-pick one thing, I would say that the onion rings were too heavily breaded, and I would have preferred them to be battered instead of breaded anyway.  But everything else was great, and I can't wait to try everything on their menu (especially the shakes).  They really paid attention to every little detail, from the atmosphere to every item on the menu.  It's nice to see a restaurant that is truly unique in so many ways.  Looks like I have a new go-to burger place.",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

119,mCVKhJzonBGiLkTHVQGdRw,Heather L.,4.0 star rating,"This is my second visit to Bareburger as I had previously been to the one in Murray Hill. I was excited to try the one in Hoboken as there is a shortage of vegetarian places in Hoboken if you don't want Italian or to go to Precious. The place is really crowded if you go on a Friday or Saturday night and you will have to wait for a table and waiting means staring at the currently seated customers as there is nowhere to wait. BYOB which is a huge plus. I was really pleased with our service as my friend and I were in a rush which we told our waiter when we sat down. They took our order within seconds of us sitting down and the food was out within 5-10 minutes. Bill was given fast too but then we waited for our change for a bit.Tried the Guadalupe (black bean burger with pickled red onions, alfalfa sprouts, guacamole, and brioche bun) with a side of fries. Loved the burger as it wasn't the standard mush that one usually gets with veggie burgers and the combination was really filling and healthy. I had previously gotten the Goat (with veggie patty, onions, green leaf, mint yogurt, relish, sprout bun) which I liked better as it was good Mediterranean flavors all on a burger.   I like the ability to mix up the types of burgers and opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Makes eating burgers and drinking beer not feel so unhealthy.

I like the hipster feel to the restaurant as you walk in, you really feel like you are in Brooklyn. There prices are a bit high but you are getting quality grass fed, organic/natural meat. They have other meats besides beef and chicken, they have duck, elk, boar, bison, goat, bean, turkey, and sweet potato burgers. I did the make your own burger with goat, duck bacon, pepper jack, on a sprout bun, but the combos are endless with all the choices being different from a typical restaurant. The goat burger was seasoned perfectly, gamy, and the duck bacon added the right amount of fat to tie the burger together. The bun was fresh and soft and really soaked the mess from the burger up.

It helps to add to the relaxed atmosphere as well.Bathroom: It's in the back and it is very clean, well lit, and inviting.Staff: Our waiter was a really nice guy but just a tad bit slow. At first I thought it was because he was the only one for the (semi-small) dining room but that was not the case. Other than that, he was friendly.Food/Drink: We had burgers (of course): a turkey burger and a build-your-own bison burger. Both were very delicious and cooked well - note: when they say ""medium"" they mean it! warm-pink center (next time I'll go medium well). We also had a side of sweet potato fries (deliciously over cooked - YUM!) and a lemonade (they allow one free refill, which is nice).Value: It is a bit more pricey than a typical burger joint, but you get what you pay for: grass-fed meat tastes so much better!This is a good spot for lunch and we will return in the future.

Here's my order (most of the time): county fair burger, side sweet fries, side dill pickles. Let's start with the burger. The bison is out of this world. The meat comes medium, and although I usually prefer it to be on the rare side, I think it's cooked perfectly. I've also had the standard which comes with beef and the grindhouse which is elk. Equally delicious. Sweet potato fries are hit or miss with me. You know when you eat way too much of something and it haunts you to even think about it? That happened to me as a kid, so I've had to ease my way back into the sweet potato thing but these fries are honestly excellent. Now for my favorite part. I'm a pickle fanatic. Fried pickles, dill pickles, pickle spears, pickle chips. You name it. Anyway, these dill pickles are life changing. The best is when you get the sliced garlic left over in the container YES YES YES. Overall, great service for both dine-in and take out. Usually I hate when places post calories on the menu, but I feel a little better knowing that this food is organic, all natural, and good for you.

In the meantime, the servers all try to act cool and laid back, chit-chatting with customers and each other, which would've been OK if they were doing their job well also.We finally got to our table, and the first thing we ordered was this hipster blueberry soda that we tried somewhere else and really liked. The server promptly proclaimed that this is the best drink in the world, but when he brought, it was very far from it. It was extremely watered down, because they decided to serve it in a glass full of crushed ice! Just give me the damn bottle and a glass on the side. Who serves soda on crushed ice?!Anyway, the worst disappointment was actually the burgers. Last time my partner tried the Buckaroo and we were both impressed with the brisket topping. So, this time I ordered the Buckaroo, and my partner went for the brisket sandwich. Unfortunately, the brisket that was included in my burger, and was the centerpiece of my partner's sandwich was so dry and chewy that I removed it from my burger and my partner was just left with the sandwich roll.So, clearly the first time we just got lucky, and now we experienced the real lack of quality control in this restaurant.

163,IlbKxrvsSifMeZGx6B3RTg,Diane C.,1.0 star rating,"I used to live close to the Bareburger on Laguardia Place in Greenwich Village and went there often.  My husband and I LOVED it and were regulars.  Now that we moved to Hoboken, we were so excited that Bareburger opened here.  Imagine my disappointment when it was significantly worse than the one in the Village.  All dreams and many years of positive feelings about the franchise name completely killed with one bad meal.I went in hearing that the menu was different from the other Bareburger.  That may be somewhat true but the basics are all the same.  Beef, Turkey, Veggie, Black Bean, Elk, Bison, etc.  Anyway.  I knew what I wanted.  Ordered Sweet Potato fries w/ dipping sauces for the table.  They were good but the sauces weren't that impressive.  I wish there was a zestier, spicier sauce option. I ordered beef burger w/ cheddar, onions, and mushrooms wrapped in collard greens.  My order looked pretty good until I realized the patty was less of a burger but more of a lump of ground beef with no cohesive agent that fell apart upon contact with my mouth.  The entire burger was a soupy mess as the collard greens was not enough to soak up the liquids from inside the burger.  It's never a good sign when your hand is covered with juice and sauce 2 bites into a burger.  Taste was salty, all mushrooms were on a single side of the burger, no good.My husband ordered the Wiki Wiki. Unfortunately the burger came out like a hot mess.  His first reaction was ""are they kidding me?""  This was alarming to me as my husband is literally the most non-picky restaurant eater of all time.  He then showed me that the bottom half of the bun had completely disintegrated with liquid - it looked disturbing and almost inedible.  Perhaps it sat on the counter a while as they were making my burger?  We'll never know because there is no way I will ever convince my husband to come back to this establishment.  Ever.",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

166,xwo3VWIrYwfKikH2mF3qgg,David C.,3.0 star rating,"Several of us at work have been participating in a ""burger challenge"" and have been visiting many of the burger joints that have been popping up in the area. We've left the true ""fast food"" chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, etc out and have stepped up to the second tier with Shake Shack, Five Guys, Habit Burger and Jake's Wayback Burgers. We've also included the third tier places like Bobby's Burger Palace, Zinburger, & The Counter. In the midst of this challenge, we learn of BareBurger in Edgewater and Hoboken along with BurgerFi (eternally ""coming soon"" to Secaucus). Last night I took a slight detour on my route to nYc and stopped off in Hoboken to visit Bareburger at 515 Washington St. A tiny storefront that features about 24-28 seats inside (booths & deuces) and maybe a dozen or so outdoor seats under an awning; Bareburger's interior design is somewhat kitschy and industrial. Pendant lighting fixtures are adorned with flatware to create a shade. The staff was attentive, inviting and friendly. The menu offers some burger combos or you can build your own. I chose to build my own with beef as my choice of protein. I was informed all beef is cooked to medium unless otherwise requested. I chose medium rare, along with aged cheddar, bacon, and wild mushrooms. There are other vegetable choices as well as sauces that are vegetarian and/or gluten free. I have been low carbing since June, so I chose to have my burger wrapped in collard greens. As I have been participating in the ""challenge"" I have been consistently been ordering bacon cheeseburgers. I can say that I have enjoyed sampling all the many burger places and have found a few to be ""ordinary"" and most others to be very good and worthy challengers. I wish I could say this about Bareburger. At $8.80 for the burger without any additional toppings I was quite surprised how bare or actually baron of meat their offering is. Burgers seemed lost in their brioche buns and for me with no bun, the predominate flavor was the aged cheddar not the organic beef. Many of the other places in this challenge also offer organic beef and provide a healthy portion (weight-wise). In fact most places have indicated the pre-cooked weight of their burgers. Not Bareburger, no mention at all. Most likely because it would be embarrassing. Not sure it would register on a food scale.On the walk from Lackawanna Station to Bareburger I passed a Five Guys.

There are lots of great combos but made my own: bison with blue cheese, green tomato and stout onions. Solid burger and since bison is supposedly healthier than 90 percent lean beef and turkey I felt kinda healthy eating eat it. Blow all the calories you saved from the bison by getting a real ice cream shake (no mixes here) and sweet potato fries.

Since these types of restaurants are harder to come by in NJ, we decided to check the place out. The hostess was friendly and gave us some great suggestions on what to order. We were seated after a quick wait, and our server was very friendly as well. The decor is charming and artsy, making for a cool dining atmosphere. I got the Farmstead ""burger"" and loved how it was wrapped in collards. The sweet potato and rice patty was delicious and came with a side of really good cauliflower hummus. The person I was with tried bison for the first time with the El Matador burger and loved it. The burger came with a surprising amount of toppings, which included guacamole, queso fresco, and jalapeños. Even the condiments on the table were healthy alternatives to conventional ketchup and mustard. We also ordered two sides - dill pickles and baby kale salad - to share. The portion size for the pickles was generous, and the salad had some beautiful heirloom cherry tomatoes. For dessert, we ordered the Bare Standard Sammie - vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies. The ice cream was amazing and probably some of the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. I would recommend this restaurant but do have some criticisms. We waited close to 30 minutes for our food. This is understandable though since it was pretty busy when we came. Also, I would have liked to see a side accompany the burger without having to order separately. Since organic ingredients tend to be more expensive, though, it makes sense for them to charge extra.

Now that I don't, I was excited to try the new Hoboken location if it meant I'd be able to get the same quality delicious burgers around here.This location has a unique menu, which is cool. But the burger patty here (beef, which I always get) was nowhere near as good as the ones I'd had at Astoria's Bareburgers. I'm not knowledgeable enough about burger preparation to know if it was simply overcooked, or if the patty was also too densely packed, or even if the meat itself is different quality. I'd ordered medium rare, and the meat was juiceless, dense, thin, and mostly grey inside. The toppings were good and almost made up for the dry, overcooked patty, but I didn't come here for a dry, overcooked patty, so it was disappointing.Also, the prices seemed pretty strange. I ordered the Grindhouse, which comes with elk, and I asked for it with beef instead. Somehow, this made the burger cost over $2 more, even though elk is the more expensive meat on the menu and I wasn't told substituting beef would bump up the price at all, let alone that much. What was an $11.90 burger on the menu turned into a $14.10 burger on the receipt, just because I got beef instead of elk.On the bright side, the fries, dipping sauces, and burger toppings were very good.

When our sandwiches came, we were both so excited to dig in - only to see that BOTH of our sandwiches were completely raw in the middle. Not just a little pink, but completely raw and inedible. When we called over the staff, at first they claimed that it 'looked that way because it was dark meat.' I'm sorry, but no - it was still completely raw. They took our food away and said they would bring us new sandwiches. After we had both taken a bite of raw meat, our appetites were gone. We flagged someone down and asked for the sandwiches to go, because frankly, we had no desire to eat them at that moment. The manager hurried out and was extremely polite and waived our bill. He was very accommodating, but gave the same excuse - that it 'looked raw because it was dark meat.' When we got our food, we left.Overall, the staff was great for taking care of our bill and getting us new food. I commend them for that. When we finally ate the fully-cooked sandwiches, they were delicious. I was just bothered that the staff couldn't simply admit their mistake instead of making up excuses.

For the area, its actually one of the cheaper places to get a real dinner, the other good place being Stacks, which is across the street.  All the other area restaurants are much closer to $20-$30/person.  This place is closer to $10-15.  The atmosphere and decor is nice as well, and its something different in Hoboken.",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

I am a huge fan of Bareburger Manhattan locations; I often frequented the LaGuardia Place location. This one has unique menu options specific to Hoboken, but the quality is superb either side of the Hudson! I ordered the Grindhouse - the elk has delicious, the bacon was thick and flavorful, and the manchego... don't even get me started. It was a divine combination. My family and I shared the Fries and Onion Rings Snack (AKA a shareable side), which comes with the delectable sauces - curry ketchup, smoke sauce, special sauce, and habanero mayo.Of course, I always recommend ordering a milkshake, made with NYC's own Blue Marble organic ice cream. My favorite milkshake IN THE WORLD is their chocolate/raspberry! Heavenly! My dad enjoyed the bananas foster milkshake very much. Our server, George, was charming, excited, and grateful!

I love the fact that it is BYOB, and the waitstaff is always great (especially for Hoboken), but the food is always lacking for one reason or another. The chicken tenders here are always overcooked, almost to the point of being burnt. I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that they're thin, or the kid behind the fryolator just cant handle the heat. The sides are OK - I really like the onion rings which are thick and crispy, with breading not batter, but the regular and sweet fries are kinda meh. My sweet fries have always come soggy. Now as for the burgers - these are always hit or miss with me. I have had more than one experience here where my burger was soggy, or the patty was falling apart. I like the variety and options that they give you, but even when you go with one of their recommended styles, I've had my burger be either bland, mushy, or just plain undesirable.

My fav is the chipotle mayo but the smoke (BBQ), special, and curry ketchup were all super flavorful.  I would ask for the onion rings on the side though because they lay them on top of the fries, which made our sweet potato fries kind of soggy. The onion rings were amazingly crispy and well seasoned though. The service was great, friendly staff, and the decor was perfect.

Like another reviewer, I got the Cowboy Caviar and was only moderately impressed. The burger was pretty flavorful - I asked for it Medium and was pleasantly surprised to see that it came out on the Medium-Rare end of the Medium spectrum (which was my hope). The toppings were also flavorful, and complemented the Bison burger well without any one item being too overpowering. However, the burger was only lukewarm, and the toppings didn't seem to be that fresh (ie the bacon had probably been cooked hours before... it was limpish and not hot). Fries were good. The curry ketchup and special sauce both complemented well.Service was 'eh.' Quite friendly, but not that attentive, and forgot our request for a bottle opener at least 3 times (and 15 minutes that we were forced to stare at our unopened beers...). This, along with the decent burger would incline me to give Bareburger 3 stars, but I trust that like most other restaurants the waitstaff will continue to improve and train. While I don't know if the burgers will get dramatically better, I know that the variety is truly impressive, and the price - for a pretty good meal - is about as good as it gets for outdoor seating in Hoboken.

It helps keep the cost of the meal down and it's also nice to just bring whatever you want. The place was packed but the wait time on a Saturday night was only about 10 minutes. Love that they have outdoor seating - always a plus during the warmer months. I stuck with the regular beef burger for my first time so I can't say I got a taste of any of the ""different"" meats this place is known for but it was still delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that our server was drunk. Like noticeably drunk. It was funny at the beginning of the meal but then as the time went on he was getting drunker and things were just awkward/uncomfortable. The rest of the staff was very friendly but every time our server came around I sort of cringed and hoped he wouldn't stop to chat. I know this location is new so hopefully it's just going through growing pains and the next time I go I won't feel uncomfortable by the end of my meal.Edited to add: our sides also came out a few minutes after our burgers which was a bit of a nuisance. Who wants to eat burgers without fries and vice versa? Again, chalking this up to growing pains but I did hear another table complain about the same issue. Hopefully they will remedy that in the future!",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

Banana foster milkshake need to try. So far my favorite burger is Goat patty, Gouda cheese, Duck Bacon, wild mushrooms, and jalapeños. I'm definitely coming back here very often",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"

At least in my situation, we brought that to our server's attention and eventually they did bring it out on a seperate dish...besides from that, I will still be a returning customerJust a heads up, this place is busy on weekends, especially during friday nights",Bareburger,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Salad,, American, (Traditional)"
