0,9LnIKV-AsaxU7kMMMGZ6iQ,Wendrich J. M.,5.0 star rating,"I always thought Serafina was an overrated restaurant in NYC. I passed by its multiple locations ALL the time and I never wanted to eat there (even though I love for Italian food). I felt it was kind of a tourist trap or something like that. I feel bad now, I recently visited the one in 12th St and my experience was better than what I expected. The service was amazing, the atmosphere was really positive and the food was great.Firstly, we got there without any reservations or anything and we got seated right away. For my surprise, it was on the second floor and it was even better than downstairs. The mood was peaceful and romantic. Amazing artwork all over the place from the vintage mirrored ceiling to the walls. The prices are really good, not expensive at all. The menu is not so extensive, but overall okay. I would definitely will continue exploring their different locations. Never judge a book by its cover, they said.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
1,TcVd32LPEMO4Iiv9OH2djw,N M.,1.0 star rating,"I had dinner two weeks ago at the Times site and had an awesome experience. And I so decided to give this one a try... BIG MISTAKE!! The only positive in this venue was the hostess. She was pleasant and inviting. Our waitress either didn't want to work or had an issue we us as patrons (maybe the color of our skin?) Either way, she was very rude and inattentive. Literally, she could care less! She even approached our table to take away our plates, didn't bother to ask if we were finished; and my friend was still eating!! We had to keep asking for items and service. My food came with vegetables: the threw two huge pieces of broccoli and that was it! And THE FOOD WAS LUKEWARM!!!!Do yourself a favor, stay away from this overpriced, pretentious location.

Thankfully it did not have that feel to it though now that I think back, there was something kind of regimented in the look of the plates....This was our stumbled-upon dinner spot on our very untraditional Thanksgiving Day!Food was overall good...the carpaccio with mustard sauce drizzle was a standout as was the butternut squash soup which really hit the spot on a chilly day after walking around for a while including up on the Highline.  The melting dollop of goat cheese plus slivered almonds added superb pops of flavor and texture.  Unfortunately the soup was a special only that day and I don't think they have any soup on their standard menu. Steak and fries was below expectations. It was unevenly cooked, the requested medium rare only on one end and the other half overdone. The fries and accompanying grilled vegetables were so bland.Service was not good either.  Too many different people showing up at the table but it still took three requests to get salt and ketchup for those sad fries. (Even the brown mushroom gravy which was so flavorful on the meat, could not rescue them.) And no one came around to refill the obviously empty water glass. We had to wave for that.The atmosphere was fun at the bar level on the main floor.

3,Kec4KvOWPhyaNMpO3S7mmg,Bindi P.,3.0 star rating,"A spacious and homey Italian restaurant with ok food. I came here for a family dinner and we were seated upstairs. We were there for an early dinner at 530 on a Thursday and pretty much had the whole place to ourselves.  It did get more packed after 630.I was drawn to this place because of their numerous truffle options. I'm a big truffle fiend! I ended up ordering truffle risotto and penne alla vodka. The risotto looked amazing when it first came out, but was incredibly salty. I took a couple bites and couldn't finish it.  I had some cousins try it as well and they agreed. I hate returning items, but this was inedible. The waiter was really nice and immediately talked to the chef to rectify this.  The second risotto was much better. It was still on the salty side, but nowhere near the first one. I probably won't order that dish again.  The penne alla vodka was fantastic.  I really enjoyed that.  For dessert we got the chocolate mousse and tiramisu. The mousse was thicker than I would've liked, but still decadent. Tiramisu was good. Service was really good.  Our waiter was attentive and prompt with our requests. It is unfortunate the truffle risotto didn't live up to my expectations, but the other dishes I had were good.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We ordered the crostini with mozzarella and prosciutto for an appetizer and I order the gnocchi bolognese for my meal. All of the food was delicious. The gnocchi were very light and soft and the sauce was flavorful. Service in general was good. However, when we got our food, five of the six of us all got our food at once, and the one of us who didn't get their food at that time ordered just penne with arrabiatta sauce (which shouldn't take that long to cook). The waiter didn't acknowledge this and made no comment like ""you're food will be out soon."" Eventually her food came out but we were all basically finished eating. It was just a little strange that the waiter didn't say anything about it. Obviously something happened with the dish (either he forgot to place the order or it got dropped) and the waiter not acknowledging it coming out later makes me think they didn't want to take responsibility for it.

Although the pasta was recommended by the server, I didn't think it was a great suggestion, but nothing else on the menu really caught my attention. Barely any pieces of shrimp with a sprinkle of chopped tomatoes, and the bowtie pasta tasted slightly undercooked.

I got the rigatoni bolognese. I got what I ordered. She got steak and frites. She said something about the order being wrong. He took it back. After that, we were basically never waited on again. Her burger finally came(by a bar-back). I tried hard to wait and not eat my food till she had hers so mine was cold. Nobody came to refill our water or ask if we wanted more wine ( they could have made so much more $$ because I DID want more wine!!)literally we were ignored. I was already thinking about writing a mediocre  review at that point, but  now that I'm helping my friend throw up for the last 3 hours I'm giving a very bad review. Within minutes of leaving she said her stomach was uneasy. She is sick as a dog. We will both say this: the food tasted great.

Just do NOT order the Chicken Parm and then don't complain about it to the manager.We had two of our party of six order it. It came out and looked like a pizza. Last time I checked chickens don't have cutlets in the shape of thin perfect circles. We looked  very hard and just couldn't seem to find any chicken. Checked the bottom and again looked like pizza. The waiter was very nice and we asked for the manager. She came over and was clearly annoyed by our concerns about what exactly this was. She suggested we look in the center to see if we could find any chicken there, no luck. We sent them back.

Her burger finally came(by a bar-back). I tried hard to wait and not eat my food till she had hers so mine was cold. Nobody came to refill our water or ask if we wanted more wine ( they could have made so much more $$ because I DID want more wine!!)literally we were ignored.

Last time I checked chickens don't have cutlets in the shape of thin perfect circles. We looked  very hard and just couldn't seem to find any chicken. Checked the bottom and again looked like pizza. The waiter was very nice and we asked for the manager. She came over and was clearly annoyed by our concerns about what exactly this was. She suggested we look in the center to see if we could find any chicken there, no luck. We sent them back.

We were finally able to flag him down and ask for the check. Our food was just average. The vegetarian platter (spaghetti squash) was good. Comes with a plain, but decent, tomato sauce and some veggies intertwined in a mound of spaghetti squash. Also tried to order the spaghetti with lobster in a spicy tomato sauce but they were out of lobster. Guess that means it's fresh and they don't just carry frozen lobster. Instead ordered the bowtie pasta with shrimp in a lemon zest and splash of cream. It was tasty, but creamier than the waiter had advised.  The shrimp were mini shrimp that had the texture of frozen shrimp or were just overcooked.

We had two brunch orders and two entrees. We had ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, which is supposed to come with maple syrup and OMG, it took a year to arrive (ok, thats a little exaggerated). The waiter knew we were being a little impatient, i mean, how do you eat pancakes without syrup? He had the bus boy go look for maple syrup somewhere. Why wasnt there any maple syrup in the kitchen during saturday brunch? after about a good 10mins (although it felt eternity), the bus boy finally comes around holding a gallon size of Aunt Jemima. Yes, Aunt Jemima! I felt a little disappointed when he came to the table holding that gallon sized maple syrup, he said he couldnt find a ramekin to put the syrup it. He proceeded to pour the syrup right over the pancakes. Sigh, for a $15 brunch item, i wouldve expected a higher end of maple syrup.

On to the food: I thought the prices were reasonable considering the area. I always had the impression that they were very expensive. I split a Margherita pie and had a strawberry basil martini. The Margherita pizza was a bit bland. Not a lot of sauce or basil on the pizza.  However, the martini was delicious. My friend next to me ordered the calamari which was very good. Although we were grateful  for them comping one of the meals, I have to say they took a long time before coming over to take our food order. They were very quick to take the drink order though.

For the entree, I had the penne ala vodka which was cooked al dente. The portion was small as well and it was just OKAY.. While it was not terrible, it was not above average. The worst part of the dinner was the service! First they forgot the bread, and then a waiter spilled water on me and my entree! He was so shocked and embarrassed he could not even muster an apology. A simple, ""I'm sorry"" would have sufficed. While I was waiting for a new plate (by this time I was hangry), they did not even change my place setting, and instead wiped it off and put another on top.. I don't know who came up with that idea but it's terrible. I received my new plate from someone who looked the manager, but again failed to receive an apology.

I then ordered the Tris of Sofia which I thought was very tasty. I enjoyed the ravioli and the gnocchi more than the paglia.  The serving was large, more than I could eat, and appropriately priced for the serving and location. The ambiance was just okay.  We sat upstairs in the dimly lit room, complete with grafitti art, exposed brick, and candle light.  Service was only okay too.  Our water glasses often went empty for long stretches of time, and we had to ask to be served bread halfway through our meal.  Overall, I'd say this place is the definition of three star.  Food was good with adequate portions but the service could benefit from some additional motivation.  Nothing overly memorable to return to next time I'm in New York, but I wouldn't dissuade people from eating here either.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
89,YDcsjGXGpYcyJeUbLp5TDA,Juliette Y.,5.0 star rating,"I have been to this location, as well as the others, many times. I love the Meatpacking location because I feel it is much more low key than the midtown restaurant, which is often filled with families with loud children and somehow seems to always be over capacity. Serafina East, in East Hampton is more of a ""see and be seen"" type place, and more about their ego than the food and the people. The Meatpacking location, however, is nothing but seamless and enjoyable. I can not say enough about this place. It is located in a super hip, up and coming area with competition on every surrounding block, including Bagatelle, Catch, Sugar Factory etc  The staff is attentive and educated about their skill set in a restaurant setting. They work ceaselessly to make each customers experience memorable. The food is incredible. If you're really going for it, the truffle beef carpaccio, salmon, Bolognese pasta, ravioli Nero and the truffle pizza are all great options !!My friend and I stopped in yesterday and sat at the bar. The bartender was incredibly knowledgable and quick on his feet. It was prime brunch hour so we watched as he cranked out order after order of bellini's, Long Island iced teas and bloody marys with extreme efficiency yet managed to take care of us and the other bar patrons with ease and enthusiasm. My friend ordered an Irish coffee, and we soon learned the coffee was brewed upstairs and the bar runner was very backed up with other orders. It took almost 25 minutes to get her drink and we were halfway through our food by the time the coffee came. To our surprise, when the check arrived it was much lower than expected. We had ordered beef carpaccio, mozzarella and tomato, two Irish coffees and two bellini's totaling only 40$. The bartender graciously acknowledged his mistake about the coffee and rewarded my honesty. He took two drinks off our check. Bravo Serafina! Great respect for customers is why people come back, not to mention excellent food.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

There is outdoor seating, which would be nice on a warm day, and the interior decor is pretty hip. The staff was also pretty nice. They were pretty attentive with refilling water and the waitress even fixed a wobbly table without me asking (I was pretty impressed). She did, however, charge my credit card incorrectly but fixed the error without hesitation.The food... I am completely disappointed. the portion sizes are ridiculously SMALL. I ordered Bruschetta and there were only three pieces, each about the size of a dollar bill folded in half. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine, there just wasn't much of it. Other items ordered by friends were: Pancakes (three pitifully THIN and lacking diameter), Eggs Benedict (definitely on the small side), Filet Mignon Burger (great taste, but small w/ not many fries), and Pizza (the only thing that was of decent size, though it was still pretty thin).While the staff, location, and decor were nice they cannot make up for the food.

But our night was ruined by a terrible service. Particularly, by our waiter (unfortunately don't know his name) who showed unacceptable manners. He was pretty polite and nice at the beginning, but what happened at the end was terrible. We had a few glasses of wine during our dinner and got tipsy. We asked for the check and gave him two cards. He divided the payment and brought it back to us to sign. Our bill was about $190. There also was a suggested tip amount of $18. As we were tipsy, we didn't realize that it was $18 from each card, so we put $9 and $9. Just didn't think of it. We were planning to leave 20% as usual, even though we had to wait for our waiter for 10-15 minutes to bring us another glass of wine, and we communicated more with the busboys (as we had a table next to the service entrance) than with the waiter himself. So, as we were leaving the place, the waiter chased us shouting ""Excuse me!  What is this? "" We were surprised, what could be wrong? We paid the bill, signed all the receipts... We asked him what happened and heard the following: ""What is  this? It's not even 10%"". We realized he was talking about the tip that we miscalculated. We apologized and gave him another $20 cash. He gave us a look and went away...As we had an amazing night, we didn't want to ruin it and to think of it. But the next morning I realize how terrible it was. The waiter chasing two girls in front of other guests like we were the thieves... Because he was not happy with the  amount of money he received. Disgusting.

It's not bad, but it's not amazing at all. It's just passable, and for the price I paid, you can get amazingly better food in a lot of different places. Maybe the hype has overrated this restaurant. I had gnocchi, and the sauce was really dull. The person I was with had ravioli, and they had very little flavor. I happened to have dinner there again, in a work-related commitment. Three people had three normal dishes, had a glass of wine each and I had a beer. We shared one appetizer and when the bill arrived it was almost 170$.

At worst, your little sister is tripped on the stairs, they don't have the legally required medical supplies (aka a basic band aid) and give you a roll of paper towels and shrug their shoulders, they freak out and refuse to serve you a single glass of wine because they're afraid of being caught with their pants down, yet impose a mandatory 'service' charge of 20% for the trouble of your blood in the restaurant. The manager, topacio, is hands down the rudest and most offensive person I have ever encountered in 2 decades of traveling the world and working in food service. She gave three fake names knowing what she was doing was shameful and we only managed to find out her name by cornering 3 guys who worked there before 2 finally admitted who she really was. She makes me ashamed to be someone that works in hospitality as she is anything but hospitable and clearly trying to cover for herself for running a shoddy establishment. Please, serafina, get rid of this awful human that works for you. Did I mention the food is only a half step above domino's?

In my 15 years in Manhattan, I haven't experienced any one of the encounters I am about to describe, let alone 3 in one sitting. I highly discourage anyone from dining here if they care for their safety and comfort.In our one hour at Serafina on Sunday at 630pm, I witnessed domestic violence at the next table of a clearly intoxicated couple who were for some reason allowed to be seated, with a man holding a steak knife to his partners's face, slapping her, a basket of fries thrown at his head and a bottle of olive oil thrown at hers. They were not asked to leave and in fact ordered 3 courses. Next, over in the waiters station, a fist fight broke out between two food runners with another co-worker pressing his body against the two runners in a an effort to contain the fight. Bins of dirty dishes spilled and broke on the floor. And the finale, a confrontation between an irate father who accused a man sitting at the table next to him of making inappropriate eye contact with his teenage daughter. The result was four men from both tables leaning into each other and pushing each other before the general manager intervened. The food is acceptable and priced accordingly. The floors, wall moldings, and bathroom are in poor condition with visible dirt and scum. The table service is well intentioned and was the least of my concerns. The general manager did not appear to understand the seriousness of the couple's violence and endangerment to the other diners. No acknowledgment or apologies from the staff except from our waitress. It was a terrible, scary dining experience. As each incident unfolded nearly non-stop my family could not believe what we were seeing and our fear escalated before the couple finally left.  Will not return and highly discourage dining here.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Not only was my table not served bread like every single other table around me before the meal, but we sat for about 15 minutes without any water while I looked silly waving my arms around trying to grab somebody's attention. The staff were just hanging around hanging around at the bar talking to each other. This happened two other times while trying to get water. And it wasn't just me, everyone at my table's water was empty and sitting there for quite some time. When I asked about the bread (after my meal was on my table), the response I get was ""Well, I mean, I could get it for you? Do you really want it?"" - No shit sherlock, thats why I asked. We never got any bread. After the meal, I found the manager on duty and she didn't even care about my experience. She didn't make a note of it and never invited me to try the restaurant again in the future. Her apology was so nonchalant and she brushed me off with a ""whatever"" kind of look. She clearly doesn't want my business nor my recommending the spot to other people. So I'm here to say, its not worth going here. There are many better options around. The service is awful and you'll be treated like a nobody, even by the manager. I took some family that came from far out of town and was hoping this would be a reliable place to introduce them to New York cuisine, but its not.

To top it off, the olives were disgusting - horrible little overly-green rubber orbs.The food - i ordered calamari. I knew it was bad the second it came out. Large rings shoved into a basket. When i bit into it, it was rubber.  I think it was either frozen, or had sat out a  bit and was re-fried and served. Absolutely disgusting and downright inedible. My friends ordered pizza. One suggested that may have been frozen and re-heated as well.  To top it off, the waiters weren't attentive either.

The menu itself I didn't try (since we were going to hit up a few more places for food later on) but I did enjoy their choices. I had my first glass ever in life (I know sue me LOL) of Veuve Clicquot and downed rather quickly (the taste didn't go with me but hey that isn't the restaurants fault). I followed that up with a pineapple and coconut martini and a serafina champagne cocktail. Both did the trick and I started the feeling the music and enjoying the vibe. I have no complaints.

My first experience at the meatpacking location (I have been to the one on the upper east side) we walked up to the hostess and asked for a seat outside for 3. She asked us if we had a reservation, not an abnormal question, but she seemed annoyed when we said no and slowly grabbed menus and sat us outside. The waiter was attentive, food was great and service was great after that. My second experience was a table for four and at first the waiter seemed bothered but I guess he realized how much money we spent and how well we tipped and brought us over a free shot. Mind you we own a business and work about three blocks away and we love the food at serafina which is why we have begun going there a lot and bringing friends. Last night and I am going to be specific because I cannot fathom why the service could be so horrible. Tuesday October 4th around 8pm my sister and I walked over to Serafina to grab a bite to eat before meeting with friends around 9:30. Plenty of time to eat and relax. Far from the experience we had. We walked in and there was no hostess at the door .. after about a minute of standing at the door a tall thin woman got up from her seat at the bar walked over and stood in front of us. My sister asked for a table for two inside. There were a few people at the bar and two woman sitting at a table eating but it was relatively empty and maybe some people dining at the outside tables. The hostess didn't even respond. Grabbed menus and sat us at a table. She went right back to her seat at the bar and continued her conversation about where she was going to travel next. Possibly Dubai ? Yeah that's how loud she was talking. Waiter comes over and asks if we want tap or bottled water.. we said tap was fine and proceeded to try to order drinks but instead he walked away. A group of four men walked in and stood at the door for a good minute when the hostess decided to finally get up from her chair and seat them outside. Within the next ten minutes that group of four men were served water and their drink orders were taken and we had not even been poured a glass of water. I even tried to get the waiters attention as he passed by and nothing. We are going on 20 minutes at this point no water and no orders even taken yet I decided it was time to leave. My sister and I got up and left. As we walked away the waiter stared at the door dumb founded. I hope he went back to the table and realized we weren't even served water. I do not care what people think, I work in customer service and everyone should be treated with respect. I believe my first experience at this location was great partly because of a different server but also it seemed like the owners were there. We were not dressed poorly and that shouldn't even matter.

Being a pretty new restaurant, we really didn't know much about it. The menu is quite solid and consists of pasta and pizza. We ordered the calamari, which was simple yet perfect. My boyfriend had the vodka penne and there were no complaints from him. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which had just enough creamy sauce without being overpowering. I had no complaints with the service, but like I said we visited at a pretty quiet time. One thing I would stress, if you don't like listening to loud music whilst you eat, this may not be the place for you. The music is quite loud. At the time we visited, the restaurant was quiet so I could still hear my boyfriend over the loud music. I'd imagine that during busier times, it would be difficult to hold a conversation over the music and background noise.Overall, Serafina was a pretty good restaurant, with nice food.

The pasta portions were fine, especially for a lunch, but our party of three all agreed our food was bland, and out of the 20 or so pasta dishes, only two or three feature any kind of protein, so we were hungry again in a couple of hours. My husband's penne pasta was undercooked. And we weren't offered any sort of cheese or cracked pepper on our dishes, which I've never had happen in an Italian restaurant. Not what we expected for about $17 a plate. Not tempted to go back.

Overall, it's a pretty standard Italian restaurant except they have a lot of options for you to choose from the menu. A bit overwhelming especially the pizza selections. I ended up ordering the Ravioli Saville, which was a bit too creamy for me. I have no problems eating Beef Ravioli with tomato sauce (Chef Boyardee, anyone?) but when it comes to creamy sauce, it gives me an uneasy, nauseating feeling. I don't know why. Nonetheless, the ravioli itself was good and pretty fulfilling. The profiteroles dessert was probably the highlight of the dinner. Stuffed with whipped cream, pistachio and chocolate ice cream (came in 3) drizzled on top with hot fudge.

However, going to the Serafina in Meatpacking isn't worth the food, as the staff is terrible and makes the experience there very unpleasant. I went as a walk in this evening and the two hostesses told me a table for two would be 30 minutes. I figured I would look around, as the restaurant wasn't even full and both of the women didn't even look when they told me the wait time. I found a table who had paid the bill and let the hostesses know the table was open. They told me I could sit, while one of them texted on their phone and the other rolled her eyes at me. The two hostesses were not accommodating and made me feel uncomfortable as they struggled to even give me a one word response when I would speak to them. They acted like they were ""above it"", when this is their job and they are representing the restaurant. As with the waitress, she was unfriendly and made me feel bad when I told her my dinner came with salt and oil on it when I asked for it without. She never came over to ask how our meal was, and she made me uncomfortable every bite I took.It's unfortunate that the restaurant I grew up going to has to be ruined by such horrible, obnoxious hostesses (bus boys are nice).

The last two in our party were running really late and the rest of us were starving, so it ended up costing them business, because we had planned on ordering appetizers and drinks to keep us satisfied while we waited. When we finally sat down and ordered, my pasta was really overcooked and mushy--I'm not even a picky eater (I love ANYTHING with carbs), so for me to even notice that means it wasn't great.

What is actually going on at Serafina? The food is not good; I mean actually BAD. I am generally of the school of thought that there is no such thing as bad pizza but this place had me questioning my philosophy. The dough was soggy and flavorless, the sparse tomato sauce tasted like really terribly tinny canned tomatoes that had been emptied from the can directly onto the dough and heated along with the pizza dough in the oven ... which brings me to my next issue the entire pizza tasted like gas. It didn't have the woodfire or brick oven charred taste that most restaurants with proper brick or wood fired ovens can pull off, unfortunately it also didn't have the neutral cooked-in-a-gas-stove taste, instead it tasted like someone left the unlit stove on for hours.Drinks are mediocre at best and are priced at the same rate or more expensive than the surrounding establishments. With all the options, many of which are genuinely great, in this area I can't imagine why anyone would come here. This should be a last resort.

""What are you implying?"" we ask, ""the hair was black was a for start"".  ""Well I didn't see it"" he says, ""that's what the waiter told me"".  I also tell him the hair was extracted from within the sauce, not on top of it at which point, having presumably realized his attempt to fob us off and imply it was somehow our fault isn't going to work, he angrily grabbed the bill off the table, screwed it up in his hand and muttered ""it's on the house"" before walking off.No apology at any point.  Just an implicit accusation and arrogance mixed with aggression.  A stance that also ignored that it was not one but two hairs we found, the second of which was witnessed by a waiter.Serafina has a nice spot on the corner but there are many other places to eat or drink outside in Meatpacking.  And hopefully they're capable of serving decent food which doesn't come with the hair or the attitude.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We had to reach around to grab water pitchers to refill our own glasses.   We had to stop another server to ask for grated cheese.  My sister's meal didn't arrive.  My husband who is the most patient man was furious and finally flagged down our waitress and told her about the missing dish and that we were still waiting on cheese.  We finished our meals and then my sister finally rec'd her meal.  There was never an apology even though the waitress obviously didn't put in my sister's meal originally.  No apologies, no mention of not charging us for the very late meal.  We noticed other tables rec'd a bread basket - we never did.  We couldn't wait to get out of there, but I did want my daughter to get dessert and feel special.  The waitress brought the dessert and walked away.  She didn't stick around to sing.  The check arrives and there is the built in 20% tip bc we were a large party.  I wanted to flag down a manager and complain but my husband just wanted to get out of there.  There is a reason this place was not crowded on Mother's Day when everywhere else in the area was packed!  It's a shame bc the building is quaint and the decor is funky.  The food is decent - nothing fancy but we ate everything.

Excellent.We also ordered a bottle of Peppoli Antinori which we really enjoyed.  I asked our waiter, Alexander if the chef could prepare me Risotto with Saffron and he returned, saying the chef could accomodate my request.  5 stars just for that.  The best part was that it was one of the best Milanese Risotto's I've ever had.  To die for!My wife ordered the Arugula salad and enjoyed it though there is too much arugula on the plate imho.All in All, a 5 star experience.  And to top it off, a high school friend of my wifes was sitting outside the same time and as we were leaving, approached her and of course, the obligitory hugging and shrieks of ""I can't believe this"" followed by more hugging.A great afternoon and thanks to the Serafina staff for contributing to our afternoon!",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

The waiter talked him in to trying the more expensive pizza regina margherita-- my son didn't like it and no one offered to make amends of any kind. My farfalle limoncello was good, and my other son had good penne pomodoro. The lemonade was the best we had tasted in years and the tap beer icy cold. My husband's pizza looked good, but I noticed he only ate half. We usually tip 20 to 25 per cent, but someone (the waiter?) had written out at the bottom of our bill 3 suggestions for tip amounts (17%, 20%, and 23%). It rubbed me the wrong way and so I left him the 17% plus a penny. I regret it now, sort of, but I thought it rude to price out the tip and also to talk my son into an $18 entree he wouldn't eat.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
218,T6sPdAgC8-95i0itlzEVOQ,Craig G.,1.0 star rating,"Today I took a group of guests to lunch at Serafina Meatpacking. It was my first visit. We came at 12:30 and were the only  guests at that time. As we entered, we noticed that the music was playing very loudly. We asked one of the staff to reduce its volume, which she did slightly. We subsequently asked her 4-5 times moreto further reduce the volume, at each time she reduced it insignificantly.I finally approached the manager, Nicole, and asked her to take care of the music volume. She flatly refused, claiming that the ""other customers"" (none of whom were present) liked music. When I told her this was unacceptable, she recommended that we leave, which we did.I'm not sure what to make of this outrage. This is the first time in my life I havehad such a horrible experience, anywhere in the world. Had we wanted loud music,we would go to a disco. This is not the atmosphere we expect for a business clientele.Needless to say, we will not return to Serafina, nor recommend it.Craig G",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I am a Hotel Concierge and send guests here all the time. I will no longer send them here. I went with some friends and the service was horrible!! Food is over-priced anyway. And not even good. The Margarita pizza had no taste. There was no basil on it, or in it when I received it. And I asked the waiter for Basil and he brought back a small piece of basil. Really? Is basil too expensive for this place to nicely place a couple of leaves on the pizzza??My wife ordered the steak and fries and the fries tasted better at Mcdonalds! And the steak was so small. For $26? on their menu. Soda $3.75? If they are going to charge these prices the service needs to be flawless.The waiter was sleeping or on something. When I submitted the bill, I payed half credit card and half cash. The waiter came back a few minutes later and said, that I owed him more money. He did not see the credit card...I gave my feedback to the manager on duty and asked for some kind of refund on the bill as a courtesy and he said well I can take away the servers tip. Really?

223,pUz0Squ9ZQouHIMiFHq0Hw,Debby H.,4.0 star rating,"For the first time, I felt that I MUST write a Yelp review after eating at a restaurant :) It was a Thursday evening around 6:30PM when my friends and I stepped into this Serafina. Let me break it down for you.LOCATION -To me, the restaurant was located in a pleasant area. My friends and I were seated on the second floor by a window, which overlooked the streets filled with interesting people and local bands.SERVICE -Our server was very pleasant and patient with us as we inquired about the menu. He gave good suggestions and checked up on us throughout our meal at appropriate intervals.MAIN DISHES - Our food was served pretty quickly, which I really appreciated because I was starving! My dish and one of my friend's dish.. simply took my breath away; they were so delicious.1) Ravioli Alla Salvia (baby spinach & Italian ricotta ravioli served w/ butter & sage) had this amazing sauce that was buttery but wasn't overpowering at all.2) Farfalle Al Limoncello (""bow-tie"" pasta with baby shrimps w/ lemon zest, lemon juice and a touch of cream) had the most unique sauce I have ever tasted. There were also plentiful shrimps on the plate.At first glance, my friends and I were a bit disappointed with the serving size, but after cleaning our entire plates, we found ourselves (even my guy friend) to be very satisfied, so I want to applaud the chef because he sure knows what he is doing.DESSERT -My friends and I ordered the Focaccia Alla Nutella (which was Nutella sauce and strawberries enclosed in this type of crust). The serving size is perfect for a party of 3-4 people. The entire ensemble was wonderfully balanced and really brought a smile to my face as I finished my meal.PRICING -The prices were a tad high (the lemonade at $4 a glass was absurd) However, taking everything else into consideration with the unique sauces on the pastas, the delicious dessert, and our full stomachs, we left with no regrets.I will definitely come back to this restaurant and recommend it to any friends who might be around Chelsea and the Meatpacking District :D Thank you, Serafina, for such a wonderful meal!",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Had to wait for a busboy and when I asked for a fork he asked incredulously, ""a fork""?? Yes I didn't want to eat my berry tart with my hands. Cute black hostess seems too busy on Facebook or whatever social media she is using  and taking selfies of herself.

We had ordered at least 150$ in food and drink that night. And were very unpleasantly surprised to find that our TERRIBLE waiter had automatically added himself a 20% tip (although it was just the two of us dining), and actually failed to inform us tip was already included on our check. I noticed the charge, and went up to the manager, Nick I believe, and asked him about the charge, as I know automatically charging tips on restaurant bills is not for parties of 2.The manager stated that Serafina automatically charges tip of 20% when diners are FOREIGNERS. I was born and raised in New Jersey, and have been living on the upper east side for the last 5 years (and I told him). Instead of getting into an argument, we paid the bill, and left the restaurant. As we left, the Manager that night graciously thanked us for our business with multiple derogatory curse words.I called the day time manager the following week, and was put on the phone with a woman who claimed to be the daughter of the owner of Serafina. She heard my story, apologized and stated she would leave a giftcard at another location for me. Unfortunately, I've checked with that location multiple times, and there was never a giftcard. All in all, terrible service, terrible management, and food that can be found in hundreds of restaurants in Manhattan.",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I was with a party for a birthday girl who went through a terrible reservation confusion with the restaurant next door (paradou. Don't go!!) and we were stranded on the street with a crying birthday girl and a party full of determined girls&guys for a new brunch option. Come Serafina the super hero savior next door with their kind waiters and hostesses. So accommodating for a party of over 20; we were seated within 5 minutes and with menus and waters in hand. The waiter (I wish I got his name) who was so kind, genuine, and would check up on all of us and he even was able to get the other servers to get the food right to their rightful order-ers. (Damn right he deserved that a-party-of-8-or-more-people-will-be-charged-a-20%-service-charge-charge. Some people really take that for advantage.) He got us extra bread and kept refilling our waters. Everything that restaurant did was so right and done in like a 'I understand what happened to you I'm here to help' kind of comforting way. Like I said, what you need after a bad breakup.We came on a Sunday, I ordered the pizza with the egg, correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was the pizza d'uovo. Like the Italian way, I had the whole thin crust pie. Easy on the tomato sauce which was so flavorful combined with the prosciutto, cheese, a pinch of basil, and the egg (just one.. And a little runny, which i like, but be aware) my friends near me had the eggs Benedict with salmon which looked so gooey-good! Didn't get to taste it but if you don't want a whole pizza for brunch, I would recommend the eggs Benedict since it also came with potatoes and a small green salad. Ill be getting that next.

By the time we were finally seated we needed to wait another 10 minutes while they figured out how to make a table for us (even though we had been there checked in for 40 minutes already).  The food was mediocre and they ""ran out"" of bread, our cocktails came out after our entrees, a total disaster. Even when we were done and just wanted to get out of there b/c we had evening reservations it took them over 20 minutes to bring us back our checks.

In such an ideal spot you would figure to have great customer service and better food! That's not what you get when you enter this place. The food is mediocre and the staff seem uninterested, I advice you to have something to snack on while you wait for your food because you become the waiter. I came again giving this restaurant a second chance because my first experience wasn't horrible but wasn't good, the bartender is a young kid who throws me completely off, they have kids serving you alcohol, it wasn't a problem to me until I realize he was as inebriated as I was. The kid had to be no older than 19. If this place can allow things like this I can only imagine what other things they allow. Word to wise if you are a tourist take the extra blocks down to a restaurant with better quality food and customer service.

""take my pic!!"" ) with our cam when asked.  The food was great.  We ordered salads, shared the Veuve Cliquot Risotto and Chicken Milanese.  We enjoyed it all and the service was great.  This place is really hopping after work and there is no shortage of ""sceney"" events.  Cops were frisking a perp a few doors down, an engaged couple was having their photo shoot done down the cobble street in between traffic.  (I just know those pics came out gorge!).  Couples were hugging and kissing (hands in eachothers pockets) as they strolled by.  All in all, great food and lots of great people-watching.  A must as a side walk table in the Meatpacking district in the Summer months!",Serafina Meatpacking,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
