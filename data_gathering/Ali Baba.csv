Hummus was decent. They were nice enough to fulfill our request of substituting chicken cubes and beef gyro with additional lamb kabob and kofta. However, when the meal came out I was a bit disappointed that they didn't really add much (3 kofta total) and the lamb cubes were small. Nonetheless, they were both flavorful and not overcooked. It also came with a plate of yellow rice. I was told they do not have bulgur wheat (surprisingly for a middle eastern restaurant), but could charge me $2 for couscous.

The place looked very clean as well so I'm looking forward to dining in one day. As for the food I ordered a lamb gyro sandwich and the tandoori chicken sandwich. The lamb was soft, succulent, fresh, and overall so delicious. My only constructive criticism with that is it didn't have a crispy exterior you sometimes see with lamb. My favorite thing about the sandwich was it wasn't overly salty or greasy. The tandoori chicken sandwich wasn't my favorite. It wasn't bad, but it was just a little bland. Also, a little difficult to eat; it's more of a messy sandwich than normal. The ingredients were fresh, but the chicken was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor. Overall, I would order the lamb gyro again but not the tandoori chicken. Also one thing I want to mention is the yogurt sauce that came with it was great. They gave me more than enough sauce for the sandwiches which was a great compliment to the food. Prices: more than fair. Service: it was a quick pick-up so I can't say much about this.

43,bkSIgqXIpEaDshS4DfQj2g,Sahil S.,3.0 star rating,"My parents are vegetarian, so I took my family here when they came to town. We ordered the fresh vegetable soup for appetizer, and split the vegetarian grand combo and couscous.First off, the decor felt like we stepped into a corner restaurant in Marrakesh rather than Hoboken. The walls are covered with Arabic and Islamic motifs, with hookahs and a sitar looking instrument propped up on shelves. Even on a late Friday night, the place was not too crowded - just the right amount of empty.The meal started with a plate of hummus and pita on the house. The pita was soft and warm, while the hummus was a creamy complement. The hummus comes pretty bland, but they provide chili oil so everybody can set their own spice level.The soup came next, and it sadly left a lot to be desired. The soup itself clearly came from a can, while the vegetables were massive chunks that didn't taste like they were seasoned at all. We didn't end up finishing it.With the main course, it was 50/50 win. The couscous was bland. My father, who is used to eating couscous adorned with many vegetables and spices, was disappointed with the simplicity of this dish. The vegetarian combo was a bunch of dips, falafel balls, and grilled vegetables. The falafel balls were probably my favorite part of the meal, crunchy on the outside and fluffy edamame inside.As other reviewers have remarked, the owner is a very warm man that seems to be actively involved in his restaurant for many years. Even though he was fasting for Ramadan, he spent the entire day in the heat of the kitchen, and still somehow had the energy to converse at length with the patrons.All in all, Ali Baba is a warm and welcoming place that I would recommend as a place for a couple of old friends to catch up over a meal. I wish I could rate this one higher, but in the end it comes down to the quality of the food, and the dishes we had just weren't up there.Ambience: 5/5Price: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Food: 2.5/5",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"

The value for money was excellent, especially for Hoboken. We sampled a few of the specialities and enjoyed every single one. The stuffed grape leaves were second to none. The place is also BYO which is another huge plus if you're looking for a cheaper way to dine out.

78,RQyLRL-yshz0e7PV_3cYPA,Sophia L.,3.0 star rating,"Walked by and decided to stop in on a Monday night. The place was virtually empty so we had very attentive service. The menu was very expansive with quite a few unique dishes. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling too adventurous that night so I just ended up ordering a lamb kabob sandwich with cucumber yogurt sauce and shared a side of falafel, which comes with tahini sauce. Lamb Kabob Sandwich ($9.50): From what the waitress told me, the only difference between the sandwich and the open face sandwich is that the latter comes with more meat. The lamb was cooked very well and was very tender, the pita bread was warm and fluffy. My only qualm is that it came with red bell peppers, which I'm not a fan of and was not listed on the ingredients list. I also requested a side of hot sauce, which was more of a spicy chili oil. While I personally love spicy chili oil, it didn't taste like it was something normally paired with this type of cuisine. Falafel Side Order ($4): Comes with 6 small falafel balls. They were perfectly fried and had a subtle crunch. On point, though I imagine its not too difficult to mess up falafel. My friend had ordered the vegetable skewer ($11.50), which ended up being a plate of grilled and sauteed vegetables drowned in BBQ sauce. She said it definitely didn't go well with what she expected to be a light, healthy dish. My knowledge of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food doesn't go far past the standard falafel, hummus, and Mamouns, but I would say Ali Baba did not seem to be the most authentic place.

My friend has eaten here before and loves the place because it's a small intimate restaurant with good food and BYOB. Although many reviews have praised this restaurant, I would have to give it only a three star review. A table was reserved under my friend's name as it was a surprise birthday party. Our fault was we got there an hour late, but the staff was generous enough to hold the tables for us. Our waitress was a good sport and very patient with taking about 10 people's orders. My fiancé and I ordered the chicken smothered platter and loved it. Their portions are a good size so sharing is suggested. I can't say the food was the best but it was good. Some of the chicken I tasted in my dish tasted different. You know when you can tell what's real chicken and what's packaged chicken you can get at the supermarket? That's what I felt like I was tasting. The sauce the chicken was 'smothered' in was delicious along with the onion flavoring and rice on the side. My only disappointment was the difference in texture when it came to my platter. I did not complain about this as it was nearing the end of the night and the restaurant was about to close. My group were the last to leave the restaurant and the staff did not kick us out. They waited patiently for each of us to leave and couldn't blame them for vacuuming once it was nearing 1130pm. I took two stars off for my chicken platter because the rest of the food was amazing. I would recommend others to try this restaurant, keeping in mind the time of when the restaurant closes.

The menu offers quite a lot- from grilled meat to veg only platters. I ordered the Ony veg platter which was babaganoush,(yummy!)  hummus, falafel (small), homemade grape leaves with aromatic wild rice (very yummy). and lots of salad, olives, pickle and hot peppers. It's really a lot of food for $13.My dad had the grilled chicken tikka open face sandwich with yogurt sauce, which came with pickles and salad. The chicken tikka was a nice smoky flavor but still tender. My mom had the Sahara chicken which was whole grilled chicken breast with really fresh grilled veggies (zucchini mostly). These were in the $12 range- only thing Is that  my mom said her chicken tasted too charcoal-y, you need to really like that charred taste (I do)One more thing to note is that the portions are huge here.

The staff was super friendly and attentive from the minute we walked in to the time we left.We started with an order of their tabooly, falafels, and baba ganoush to go along with the warm basket of pita that was brought out. The tabooly was to die for, it had just the right amount of parsley and lemon absolutely delicious. The falafels were like mini falafels that has an awesome crunch with each bite. The baba ganoush is by far the best baba ganoush I have ever eaten. For our main course we shared the combination of chicken, lamb, gyro, and kufta served with rice platter. It was completely amazing, everything was cooked to perfection. We opted for lentil rice, which was delicious and our meats were also servers with Yogurt Cucumber salad, hummus, and baba ganoush. The only reason I won't give this place a 5 start rating is because the kufta was served with some kind of BBQ or A1 like sauce on the bottom and it was so not necessary!

I would like to note, first of all, that as soon as we walked in the restaurant, we were bum-rushed by the waitresses regarding whether we had purchased a Living Social deal. We disclosed that we had, but the sub-mediocrity that followed makes me suspicious that they served us smaller, crappier portions BECAUSE they already knew that we weren't paying full price for the meal???Now, if I am at a restaurant in the New York metropolitan area, and I have to reach across the table for the salt to flavor my meal, I just can't help but feel embarrassed; both for myself, and for the restaurant's chef. At Ali Baba, the curry lamb stew, to my dismay, was absolutely tasteless, and I couldn't choke it down without the addition of salt AND pepper. It was served with a side of unremarkable lentil fried rice. The mousaka was not as terrible as the stew, but it wasn't really that good, either. The portions of both dishes were inappropriately small. Even the dressing on the Greek side salad was way under-seasoned. We ended up leaving so dissatisfied with our dinner that we headed directly to Mamoun's for shawarma immediately upon exiting the restaurant. Mamoun's was reliably tasty, yet we ate it quickly, and out of anger, for our previous experience at Ali Baba.",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"

The one young man, I want to say he was the owners son was dressed in jeans and a third shirt was chilling and drinking beer when an untrained waiter was taking our order. Going back to the food, everyone we went there we order falafel sandwiches and the pita bread comes warm. Today they were cold  when we called the waiter and waitress over they started to argue with us saying they ate always served cold.  She finally offered to heat up the sandwiches as she was walking towards the kitchen made a smart remark to the other waiter. Also she was giving attitude and rolling her eyes at the kitchen staff. Another thing about the food was that as an appetizer they give warm pita breads on the side with butter and hot sauce. Today they have it to everyone else but our table.  When we asked for it she added a hummus appetizer to our bill. The service was very bad today and if the owner was there none of these things would be tolerated.  Lastly when the waiter came to give us ur bill he added an extra dollar to our bill. The hummus appetizer was 7 dollars on the menu but he wrote 8 dollars. This was the first time in 21 years I have seen this type of service.

159,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,2.0 star rating,"In the past few years, I have begun to diversify my palate and have become more interested in ethnic cuisines.  I really like Middle Eastern food and was pleasantly surprised to find one of these restaurants right in my area...and especially one ""celebrating its 25th anniversary""!  However, my friend and I were less than impressed with our meal.Let me first describe the environment.  Picture a quaint, intimate dining room with Middle Eastern accents.  Then, imagine a nice, but loud caretaker screaming into the phone regarding deliveries.  Oh, and do not forget the mysterious sound of microwaving coming from the open kitchen...neither of which added to the ambiance.  The cheesy paper takeout menus apparently also serve as dine-in menus, which might as well have entitled us to leave a lesser tip.  The cuisine offerings were a confusing mix of proteins served as sandwiches, open salads, or platters.  It was difficult to discern which type of meal included which sides.  The chatty manager was very helpful with the menu, though, and helped us settle on Ali Baba Combination.  This included our choice of 1 or 2 meat kebabs, hummus, baba ganoush, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, feta cheese, pickles, olives, peppers, and yellow rice.  My chicken kebabs were tender and decently tasty, though I suspected they had been nuked in the microwave.  The feta cheese was a bit slimy, and I only received one random chunk of it.  All in all the platter provided a lot of substance for the reasonable price under $15.  However, the hummus had an odd strong lemony taste, which my friend described as ""soapy"".  This should have been one of my favorite components on the platter, but instead turned me off.Like many restaurants in Hoboken, Ali Baba is a BYOB, which could be good or bad.Ali Baba has potential, but I think they need to focus a bit more on the quality of their food.",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"
160,km-ItCK_1G5Nm0lTs_etFQ,Homer S.,1.0 star rating,Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.I had an unwarmed lamb soup (microwave no working?) and my guest had a vegetarian meal. The hummus and baba ganoush were enough to make me sick later. (And by sick I mean throw up.) I didn't appreciate the putrid-like taste that apparently others enjoy.That being said the place seemed busy and was getting a lot of calls for delivery.

161,4Pp1NdLWPg4EIPchw-gV6A,Adam K.,3.0 star rating,"Being Lebanese, I'm probably a little tougher on a middle eastern place than I should be. I ordered the lamb platter. The baba and hummus are good, but I can make it better which is kind of a negative in my books (why pay someone else to do a worse job?) The lamb was very good and at $15 I had a good meal at a steal of a price in Hoboken.  Overall it seems like this place does killer take-out business and had extra room and thought ""hey, how about throwing some tables and chairs in here?""",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"

164,42qLOul-_dL2lalySaG0UA,Jennifer C.,2.0 star rating,"The company I work for had ordered take-out dinner here because we had to work late.  I had the kufta kebab (lamb) and it was just mediocre.  I think the white sauce was a cheese or cream sauce and it was really unappetizing as it was starting to flake/dry-out on the meat =(The only component of that dinner I liked was the baba ganoush (pardon my spelling).  The pita for the group of us came in its original packaging (6 pieces in some plastic bag with a twist tie) and it had just been taken out of the refridgerator.  A lot of my co-workers had a bad impression of Middle-Eastern food after that experience, but I encourage you to try other restaurants that serve the same cuisine.  I personally have and I've enjoyed Middle-Eastern cuisine elsewhere.",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"

Have eaten here several times, service is always pleasant, helpful and speedy. I wouldl eat here more often if I lived closer, love the cute atmosphere, has a funky kind of vibe.

After we were served I realized that the yogurt could be unpasteurized, and being pregnant, knew I had to ask. Turns out that it wasn't (they even brought out the container to show me), so I politely didn't eat it, while my friend enjoyed. About 10 minutes later the waitress brought another bowl and said that her father (the chef) made me a new dish with yogurt that was pasteurized. SO incredibly thought and totally unnecessary. Definitely a small, family run business, and prides itself on taking care of its customers. Thanks Ali Baba!

177,lwmuoQOO3SI6V-tOQv40NA,D R.,4.0 star rating,"The food is amazing.  There's nothing I've had here that didn't rate highly with me or friends.  Moussaka - killer.  My favorite is the lamb curry platter.  It's a different curry, one that traditional curry lovers will like, and even curry haters would like.Open with hummus or baba, they're both excellent here, and I love the way they toast the pita bread for dipping.Have the turkish coffee with desert before leaving.  It is made perfectly (complete with sludge at the bottom), and just the right amount of sweetness.  The baklava is pretty good.  Ok, I've had better elsewhere, but it's still good, and probably the only thing on the menu that isn't the best in the area.Even the gyros are good here!  They measure up to any others I've had outside of a tiny joint on 58th and 9th that's no longer there.So if the food is so outstanding, why only four stars?Well, it's the service.  But read on.  The staff there is actually terrific, the problem is just that when the place is busy, there are far too few of them.  The waitress I've seen there most often completely busts her butt and always has a great attitude.  But there's only one of her, and she's human.I feel a little bad rating it down one star for service when the staff really does try hard, but owner should try to anticipate and handle busy periods more effectively.Definitely eat here - if you like Mediterranean (incl Moroccan, Greek, Turkish), you will not be disappointed!",Ali Baba,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Middle, Eastern,, Vegetarian"
