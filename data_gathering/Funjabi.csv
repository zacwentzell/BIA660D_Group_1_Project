0,i_WxJpoxfsddmBne6I8cKQ,Durva L.,4.0 star rating,"This is such a small place, but some great real Punjabi food. We tried an Indo Chinese soup but would recommend that cuisine. Once we ordered hara bhara kebab and received tandoori barbecued veggies!!! They were delicious nonetheless so I am not complaining! Do take away or order in. Â Simple and friendly chef. This is our new go to place for dhaba fare",Funjabi,2.5 star rating,,"Indian,, Chinese"

The delivery person called me that when he went to the place it was closed. It was good of seamless to give me a refund.,Funjabi,2.5 star rating,,"Indian,, Chinese"
