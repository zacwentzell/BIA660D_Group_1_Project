As first timers, no one was there to seat us upon entering the place, which already seemed overly occupied. Finally, upon being seated, they started us off with dry bread and oil (literally). Then, my girls and i ordered the garlic shrimp (since we had very few options to choose from). I'd rate it a B-, edible (the garlic seemed undercooked and overpowering, sort of like a frozen version). The drinks, however, were good (sangria and mojito). The ""dancing"" ... was sad. In other words, it wasn't really ""dancing."" Rather, it was drunk individuals either doing ballerina across the floor or dry humping. Many of the men seemed really drunk and creepy, sweaty, randomly touching women here and there. If you're seeking to just have a drink and get you and your mate 'ready' for the night, and require a nice corner to dry-hump in the dark, then maybe you should consider this place.

With our group we decided on the prix fixe menu, which worked very well.  The cheese empanadas were definitely the hit of the evening. I wish the vegetables came out early than they did (the last plate of the evening). Good and attentive service, our waitress was great to work with. We waited until 12:30ish for the dancing to start but when there were no signs of it beginning, we decided to call it a night.",Kaña Tapas Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Tapas, Bars,, Spanish"

Their music is awesome, the bartenders are cool, and you really do meet a ton of people from outside the U.S. I might sound obnoxious, but meeting people from different countries is like, my jump off, ok? Get there before 11:30pm if you don't want to pay to get in. If you get there past that time, they will charge you I believe $10? Regardless, with the charge you get a free drink inside. I'm about it, plus it reminds me of all those European clubs so just to be nostalgic, I'll get there at 11:35. Don't judge.I wouldn't go here with a large group. I suggest for anyone to go here with a small group of friends, about 2 to 4 people. Parking around Kana isn't TOO bad, I've gotten lucky every time I've driven there with a spot close by. They don't do coat checks, so you either hide it somewhere inside or hold on to it. Don't be a brat, suck it up. This place is worth it!",Kaña Tapas Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Tapas, Bars,, Spanish"

68,qTYJmQDE8MmlC2E8lKIx0A,Gretchen W.,4.0 star rating,"Kana is a little gem restaurant located all the way west on Spring street. The space is small and a bit inconvenient to get to, but that doesn't keep people away. In fact, supposedly, it turns into quite the night spot on weekends with Latin dancing. The menu is pretty basic tapas, with choice of large or small plates. I know one of the waitresses at Kana, who gave us her opinion on some of the yummy tapas to get. First of all, the sangria was yummy, which is always a good start to a meal! We shared the Jamon y Queso(Prosciutto with Manchego Cheese), Mejillones Marinados (Marinated Mussels), Chorizos al Jerez (Spanish Sausage sauteed w/sherry wine), and Albondigas (Spanish Meatballs in wine sauce). We shared a really yummy caramel filled crepe for dessert, which was just the perfect amount of sweet to end our meal satisfied. My favorite was the Albondigas, as the meatballs were just really flavorful and interesting... not at all like the meatballs you find with spaghetti. I also enjoyed the mussels quite a bit, which were enormous and served cold in a marinade. I didn't expect the mussels to be cold, but really enjoyed them. I would certainly go back to Kana. The atmosphere is nice and its a great spot to take a date or some friends. Great for a group as well and I believe they have prix fixe tasting menus for larger parties.",Kaña Tapas Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Tapas, Bars,, Spanish"

The place was empty and smelled a little of chlorine, but we'd had plenty of lovely nights here over the years so we decided to stay for awhile. Plus, we weren't hungry for dinner, but we weren't NOT hungry either. We were a party of four and enjoyed a two rounds of tapas and two rounds of drinks.The food and service were both fine, but when we got the check, we noticed a 20% gratuity had been added (somewhat discreetly) for our party of four. The menu had noted a 15% gratuity would be added for parties of 6 or more, and I think that's pretty normal and acceptable. But 20% gratuity already included for just four people? That's crazy! I clarified with the waitress that the tiny ""sc"" meant the service charge had already been included, and she confirmed. I don't know if the waitresses were trying to make up for the slow night or what. I always tip 20% or more for good service, but the fact that they tipped THEMSELVES really left a bad taste in my mouth. Especially since it was very discreetly added to the bill. Had we had a few more rounds of drinks or not bothered to check the bill, those girls might have gotten a 40% tip. It's just shady business, and really tainted our whole experience.If you go to Kaña, CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY!!!!",Kaña Tapas Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Tapas, Bars,, Spanish"

I had a lot of fun dancing to the music here. It's a bit over-crowded, and some drinks are too expensive - Miller light, 7 bucks - wtf/ew.

The tapas menu was simple and basic. The octopus continues to be my favorite dish however it's made. We had champagne instead of win for the sangria. What a treat! We were full in no time!

So argue with the ""bouncer"" aand tell him you're there for tapas, which goes till like 1130. I went with a big group for my birthday & luckily of like 14 of us, only one had to pay the $15 cover.
