I love going to local restaurants versus chain restaurants so I generally don't like leaving bad reviews on local places. As soon as we walked in, there was no host/hostess to seat us, so we were left wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out how to sit down at a table. Finally, we approached someone at the bar who ignored us for a minute and then looked up and sat us at the table. We ordered 2 glasses of wine, oysters, and spinach artichoke crab dip. It took forever for the waiter to come over. He was very friendly but clearly rushing around (not his fault) so when I needed some advice on what oysters to order he just suggested we get one of each- not great advice but that's what we did. The oysters were delicious but the dip was lukewarm on top, chips weren't fresh, and barely tasted like spinach, artichoke, or crab. Was very weak which was disappointing because we already weren't super happy with the place.

Creative cocktails, good spirit selections and a cool atmosphere make this place a great choice when looking for an enjoyable experience in Hoboken.I had a my usual rum drinks and even had the bartender put something unique together for me made with rum. To compliment this, I also got an order of clams casino. Though the taste itself was good, it was way too breaded, causing it to taste slightly lumpy and doughy. If they fix that, they've got themselves a perfect little dish.The atmosphere is loungy and cool. Sort of a trendy vibe but not overly so. It's not a big place, so I can see it getting packed on weekends rather quickly. Either way, the best seat in the house is at the bar as the bartenders are pretty creative and will hook up some good drinks if you ask then to. Definitely a place I'll come back to when I'm in town.

I hate to leave a mediocre review because the raw bar is excellent and Hoboken needs more places like this...so I want stingray to survive. However I have been here several times with consistently lousy service. The bartenders let you sit there for 20 minutes without acknowledging you and then totally mess up simple orders.

I went yesterday for their 50 cent clams happy hour which is a great deal (and worthy of the 3 stars) but the $15 octopus and $15 skirt steak was a serious slap in the face and wallet to any customer. I am no stranger to small plates, but this was minuscule. Small plates are meant for sharing but when something is literally a few bites, how on earth do you accomplish that?! Honestly, as someone who orders octopus appetizers often I don't know how they feel it's ok to serve what they did - I've never experienced that before. $70 later we were still starving, but ate at home because we felt we would be foolish to keep ordering more small bites.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

Stingray, you have won a permanent spot my heart as perhaps my favorite place in Hoboken. The best part is that I can come here with my husband and know that we will both be as equally happy. Thank you for that. Our server was extremely delightful and offered the perfect suggestions. When we weren't sure about which beer we wanted, she recommended one and stood behind her suggestion by bringing us both a tasting - how thoughtful! She was right on the money and we ordered that beer. The raw bar entries, for me only of course, were as delicious as I remember from my trip a few weeks ago. The most surprising high note of the night was the food that my husband ordered, the balsamic chicken sandwich. Holy moly that was good! So good that it made me a little envious that I hadnt ordered it. It also comes with a perfect compliment of homemade potato salad, which round its out nicely. Seriously, its that good.

Stingray lounge saved us from starvation. Thanks to fellow yelpers I was pretty sure disappointment was not an option. As I entered I noticed the trendy decor and set up. You also notice the dim lighting which helps you feel at ease before you order. I sat at the bar and noticed the happy hour chalk board. $3 off sandwiches and $3 off house cocktails (not to be confused with signature cocktails, not happy hour) Well I was sold. They run out of the first sandwich I ordered but fortunately they had two more options. I ended up getting the balsamic chicken sandwich. It really sparked my taste buds. Maybe it's the perfectly crispy bacon in the sandwich. It was so good I ordered a second one.  It comes with a side of potato salad. The crab cakes were fresh and were shaped as spheres, not your typically patties you might find in Baltimore.  Drink: Dutch courage. Gin base.Feels like a martini.

60,XNY6tbZDetgEyeqh2_q_Ag,Allison B.,5.0 star rating,"Stingray is a fantastic and relatively low-key lounge/bar uptown in Hoboken. It's got a very laid back vibe, fantastic service, and an excellent cocktail menu that's constantly rotating. I haven't had the food there yet, but last time my boyfriend and I were there, the crab cakes came very highly recommended, so that will have to happen next time. The space is U shaped, with one side being a huge bar and the other side with awesome oversize couches and chairs. The spot itself is made for conversation - the music is on, but absolutely not overpowering (or even close to it), there isn't sound on the one TV that I saw while there, and the cocktails are pricier (though on par for the NYC area) than other Hoboken bars. The bartenders know their shit and it's a lot of fun to watch them mix up the cocktails. My most recent visit here, I had a take on a Negroni (the actual name I can't remember), with gin, Vermouth, and an orange peel, which was delicious. Cocktail prices range from $13-$15, beers are ~ $6-$7, and they have a few small plate options as well, though not an extensive menu. My boyfriend and I have come here a handful of times and enjoy it every time. It's a fun, laid back place to either start or end the night with a drink or two, though I don't think this is really the place you'd go to spend all night. More upscale, so like other reviewers have said, don't go expecting after hours drink specials or blaring music - and make sure you like the person/people you're going with, because there are no distractions to keep you from wanting to die inside if you go here with bad company (but that's your fault, not Stingray's).",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

The owner Jeff mentioned he wants to keep his spot low key and chill and fall slightly under the radar so his local regulars will always have a spot to come to. Too bad Jeff, I'm letting the cat outta the bag.I love this spot and wish it 'twas in Jersey City, but my bank account may prefer that it stays in Hoboken. This is more lounge/bar than restaurant, so those coming expecting to order dinner, although you can, you may be a bit disappointed since the food menu is more snacks and oysters/raw bar. The venue itself is divided into two sections - as you enter a long bar with about 20 bar stools and then up around the bend you see a long communal table and two ""loungey"" sections with little leather couches and chairs with tables. So intimate, so sexy.I'd honestly suggest coming for a few cocktails and a round of oysters before dinner, then returning for a post dessert night cap in this sultry, upscale spot. If you happen to not like oysters or seafood for that matter, there is the most amazing little eggplant sandwich ($10), but other than that you are S.O.L (shit out of luck). The oyster menu is divided into east vs west and very accurately priced. There is no gouging here - and that was a) a shocker and b) made me love this place even more. You will not see $1 oysters, lets just get that on the table. i nibbled on a few oysters and really enjoyed the previously mentioned eggplant sandwich. Fried eggplant sandwiched between crunchy Choc Au Pain bread with a nice smear of aioli. LOVE. The accompanied side potato salad was surprisingly delicious and hearty. So simple, yet so so so good. The price tag again, fair.They literally have every type of booze possible. I stuck with Buffalo Trace cocktails as I was with my homegirl from BT and the bartender hooked me up with an ever so simple, but delicious BT, real ginger, lemon and simple syrup concoction. They also have a diverse speciality cocktail list that I will definitely explore upon my return. I didn't see any tap handles or wine for that matter - so I'd double check on that if it happens to be a deal breaker.There are a tv or two, but don't expect sports, but rather old back & white movies. Music was an eclectic mix of sounds, but no top 40 hits or EDM and for that Stingray, you are a Hoboken pioneer (ahem, since the old Maxwell's has departed) and I love you for it. The brief conversation I had with the owner Jeff was really impressive. He's very passionate about his venue, so much so that a lot of refinishing and decor was built with his own two hands (i.e. the most beautiful farm table that he repurposed himself from the old wood that came from the building). He comes across as both kind and authentic and clearly you see that in his business.Who knew one could go so lengthy with a cocktail and oyster bar?

Drinks a little on the sweet side but tasty and well made.We went here specifically for the oysters, and we weren't disappointed. This would only be my second time trying oysters, but I enjoyed them much more than my first. We asked for a recommendation from the bartender/host and he suggested we get a selection to try. So we got 10 oysters, two of each of the following: stingray .After trying them all, we definitely determined that we enjoyed the stingray oysters the most. They were slightly smaller and more delicate, and they had a good texture - not overly jelly-like. My boyfriend made a comment saying that there wasn't much grit in these oysters like there normally would be elsewhere- and right then, I chewed on a big piece of sand. Ouch. But that was the only one, not sure how common that is as an oyster newbie.As for that atmosphere, it was pretty quiet. It was Sunday of July 4th weekend, and they were open but not busy. The place was quite small- I don't know why I expected it to be large (what was I thinking? This is Hoboken). It pretty much was a narrow room that extended to the back, just consisting of the bar, and a small 2-person lounge-y seating area by the front window. The bar had white tabletop granite, giving a very clean look. Actually, the whole place gave off the clean, white, chic vibe. I expected this place to have an NYC ""lounge"" feel, but it was more cute and clean cut. All in all, a pretty good, quiet date spot. Kind of pricey ($30something for 10 oysters and $13ish per drink), but they have some happy hour specials you should check out. We definitely want to come back for the 1/2 price oysters (on certain days). Also, the place is pretty out of the way, uptown Hoboken. A bit of a walk if you're downtown.

Got the $60 ""4 of the kind"" deal for 2, which includes a dozen of 4 types of oysters (3 east and 1 west), 2 types of clams, crab meat, and chilled shrimp. Ordered seconds a la carte because it was so good. Mussels were tasty but on the small side, both in terms of shell size and portion. Fries with bay seasoning were great; they're served with spicy mayo, which actually paired well with the horseradish served with oysters. Drinks were delicious too. One of the best old-fashioneds I've had - strong yet tasty. Sauvignon Blanc was also great.Service was professional, prompt and super friendly. I feel the combination of all those 3 qualities is hard to come by.

Plus, not to mention, they seem to be the only raw bar in town, so I hope for us raw fish lovers, they stick around for a while.So, my comments aren't really criticism, rather a few points of suggestion:Blue point oysters are my fave - if you love the taste of the sea, you know what I'm talking about. The blue points at Stingray, while good, were a bit mild for my taste. I was expecting a bit more of a briney vibe. The horseradish seems to be home made, which they get brownie points for, but it was literally the most mild horseradish I've ever tasted. Literally, no heat. My friend thought I was just being picky until she tried it, and agreed. The flank steak could use some help in the flavor dept. Not that it has none, just not crazy bout the ponzu thing. The string beans were awesome, thought.Crab cakes although small, rock. Perfectly cooked. Could be a bit larger. The shrimp are very good and colossal size. I would suggest working on their cocktail sauce as Kelcher's store brand has them beat. Perhaps adding Worcestershire and/or some Old Bay, etc.Happy hour on Sun and Mon is great thus if you love oysters/clams etc. I would definitely recommend it.Outdoor seating is a bonus.Overall, very glad we found this place.

The bar is decent-sized and wraps around the back of the place, the other side is more of a lounge area with chairs and couches. It's hard to choose which side is better! The whole look and feel of the place is really cool, lots of tile and rustic bar, I'm a big fan.Bathroom: I did not use it during this visit.Staff: Our bartender, Matt, was super cool and very helpful with the menu, both drinks and food. If it weren't for him I would have been lost on the oysters. Next time I plan to come in I'm going to have to check and make sure he is working again. Thanks, Matt!Food/Drinks: We started with some drinks: Blanton's on the rocks (delicious, of course!) and one of their house cocktails (very good). We then moved on to some small bites: Crab Cakes (very good), Colossal Shrimp cocktail (great-sized shrimp! YUM!), and assorted oysters: Irish Point, Kumamoto, Blue Point (all good, but the Kumamoto was definitely the best!)Value: The prices are a bit high, but then again it's FRESH seafood so what do you expect? When the final bill came I was a bit surprised, then I remembered all the delicious bourbon and seafood I ate and it started to add up.This is a cool little place that I really would not mind making frequent visits to for drinks or snacks.

Anyway, I loved it! I really hope this place makes it and stays in Hoboken, it's awesome! We walk in and all I see is this beautiful massive marble bar with about 20 seats, tons of unique liquors, and a gorgeous display of raw seafood. Very upscale & classy looking. The cocktail menu had about 10 drinks on it, I was the pain in the butt that had to order something off of the menu, but they made it well (I had a Pisco Sour). My two friends ordered Bloody Mary's. They only offer fresh seafood appetizers, nothing else, so it's excellent for a date or a quick bite, but I wouldn't go starving. We ordered a seafood platter to hold us off before dinner which included 3 Blue Point oysters, 3 clams, and 3 oysters (I can't remember which ones as I'm not a huge oyster fan), 3 pieces of shrimp cocktail and raw crab meat. Delicious. After my Pisco Sour, I asked the bartender to mix me up something sweet, it was exceptional. Awesome mixologist! I believe their cocktails are about $15 each, I forgot how much the seafood was, but I think it was reasonably priced considering it's all super fresh. I will definitely be back. I walked to the bathroom at one point and checked out the other room where they have one high top table that seats about 6 and a couple lounge chairs towards the windows at the front of the restaurant. Super cute, cozy, date like atmosphere. When we walked in the place wasn't too crowded, but by the time we left it started to get really crowded. They have 1 tv above the entrance door that had sports on (about 36 inch flatscreen). I will definitely be telling others about this place, and hope that more spots like this open up in Hoboken!

I love the color scheme and atmosphere of this place- warm grey with fresh white. Came here with my bf for date night and it was everything we wanted- sophisticated, fresh oysters and slammin drinks. The prices unfortunately are steep but the quality is amazing.We ordered our drinks first, the Dutch courage $12 and the classic Manhattan $13. Drink quantity is skimpy so don't except much. The taste though was amazing. The Dutch courage is an interesting drink that composes rose and almond together. Very nice. To eat we had half dozen of honeysuckle oysters and half dozen of clams on the half shell. Ice cold and bursting with ocean flavor. Very fresh.For hot food, we tried the crab cakes which were beyond delish ($10). Three baby crab cakes that were ALL crab. We also tried the eggplant sandwhich was good but not amazing. I wish the bread was toasted and there was more pesto so it wasn't so dry. We also had the fluke Crudo which was one of my favs of the night. Asian influence and very tasty.We came on a Monday night and the bad was packed but the back/lounge area was free. I'm sure if you come on a weekend night you can't even get in.

The menu is limited but high quality.  There are a few vegetarian options but the bulk of the menu is seafood based (rightly so).  I ordered the jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail and the tuna crudo. Both were amazing. My friends ordered a variety of oysters, clams, and jumbo shrimp, all of which received rave reviews.  We especially loved that the raw bar selections came with both cocktail sauce and a mignonette.  It was a great alternative.

122,ezwXOgtYdZPHOljENymgcw,X X.,2.0 star rating,"Disappointed based on what I read and saw online. Below are several examples  of basic raw bar functions that were missed.We started with what had to be the worst Moscow mule I've ever had, couldn't drink more than a few sips. The hot app's came out first which I would not have expected, but the crab cakes and baked clams were pretty good. I will say i haven't seen littleneck clams that tiny, some were smaller than cockles. The service was OK, not available enough to support us as all the food we ordered flew out. It took 3 people and multiple attempts to get the several varieties of oysters we ordered identified. The mignonette came with no spoon, good luck pouring that into each shell, though there was room given that many oysters had lost their liquor.  The tuna crudo app tasted of flaky sea salt and nothing else and was poorly sliced. The decor was nice, fitting of what they're trying to do here.Did we catch them on a bad night, I'd say no, this strikes me as a place with more style than substance that takes advantage of the built in customer base that comes with a town like Hoboken.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

Cute space that I admire from the bar, but I've never been to Stingray for their couches. The food is on point. Definitely not the place for a hearty meal but who cares? Oysters, oysters, and more oysters are all I care about. Sometimes you'll miss out on a couple raw bar menu items, but generally they have a nice selection. Definitely go during happy hour. We make our way up to Stingray early Sunday evenings and never leave disappointed. Half price on my prized prosecco, and of course, the oysters. The service tends to be slow on Sunday's. I can't really comment on any other time of the week, but it's not a deal breaker. It's nice to go and chat and enjoy company, but don't go if you're in a rush.

Every single visit has been a true treat.On this last visit my wife and I asked the bartender to surprise us and I was treated to a Mint Julep that would do any Kentuckian pround and a Bloody Mary that my wife has actually been craving since as she put it "" Anyone can make a Bloody Mary but...a good one is another story."" As always the raw bar was fresh and the selection second to none. The Stinray doesn't have an huge menu but every item on it is excellent. That you can count on. At the end of the day Stingray is a small oasis on Washington that offers a consistently excellent experience in an intimate setting.

So fresh tons of flavor. The lump crab was incredible. We ended up ordering another round of crab and 1/2 dozen more oysters. I can't wait to go back. This isn't a place you go to if you're looking for sit down entrees but if you're looking to pick at great seafood and interesting cocktails this is the place. The bartenders are super knowledgable & helpful. I wanted to try something a bit different than my usual vodka soda. After letting the bartender know what I like and didn't like she recommended a gin cocktail. I told her I absolutely hated gin but she assured me that she could change my mind. I'm always up for a challenge so she mixed me up a cocktail and I have to say she really did change my mind. It was not the gin I've tasted in the pat that mirrors pine needle taste.

We also had some half lobsters and from the piece of claw I had; 3 thumbs up. In addition we tried the tuna crudo which was presented beautifully. The vivid green sauce was heavy on the citrus, garlic, and wasabi and outshone the tuna itself which was just okay. The bartenders are very attentative and the cocktail list has some winners packed with quality ingredients. My only knock might be that the menu is pretty limited, and filling up on shellfish can be tough especially if you're looking to soak up some of that alcohol.

173,PlG8Msz0VbcXdjtZOrPRLg,Alisha H.,3.0 star rating,Pricy pricy pricy! Manhattan prices in Jersey? The place is upscale but be prepared to dish out some mad cash. $20.00 for a glass of wine? I could be on the rooftop somewhere in the city. Overpriced.  The Oysters are great though. Could've been a weekly hangout if the drinks were cheaper or had better drink specials. Good one time date night.,Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

The maitre dude was slightly aloof but the chef came over and excitedly answered our questions and told us which were his favorite oysters and why. Great tunes. Elaborate drink menu. What Hoboken needed ten years late but when sipping a Don Julio 1942 tequila at the bar it feels right on time...",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"
175,_WNb7yir1XLaoJ5nWTnsVw,Patrick G.,5.0 star rating,"Upon entering the Stingray Lounge I immediately realized it was offering up something different than your typical Hoboken bar. A very relaxed vibe with an extremely welcoming feel and charm makes you feel like you've been coming to this establishment with your friends for years as soon as you walk in. They offer a wide array of well made cocktails on top of an extensive menu of choices to choose from. I very much enjoyed trying new whiskey's and bourbons at an affordable price. The wait staff was extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgable about their product. All of the food we ordered was exquisite. I've never tried oysters before and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them. Offering many kinds from around the world it was interesting to see how they all differed from each other. Also all of the wait staff, especially the general manager had faces like beautiful earth angels. After a night of laughs and tom foolery with my good friends I'm giving the Stingray Lounge 5 stars... in short, it rocked my butt off.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

The rest of the experience went downhill after that. The waiter wasn't attentive at all - asked for water and it took 15 minutes etc. We understood that it was busy and they were short staffed but they weren't apologetic or do anything to try to make us feel like paying customers. This would have been fine as we are not high maintenance diners but the reaction from the male waiter when we spoke up about a mishap that occurred to us  was absurd. Maybe he had a bad day but when I was a waitress, I leaned to be humble and apologize and never speak back to patrons. Especially when it is your fault. They took our order wrong - ""4 of each eastern oyster"" was interpreted as 1 of each of the 4 oysters.... So 20 minutes later we received 4 oysters for 3 people. After clarifying the order - 12 more oysters arrived. After eating them the waiter came looking pissed because apparently those weren't meant for us and there was a mixup. After asking to correct the check since we ate the wrong food, he wound up charging us a few more dollars because apparently the oysters we ate were slightly more expensive. Never coming back here for that reason. It's as shame because the oysters were good.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"
177,K3rmdmb4w2EE2Rrnz0_mrg,J M.,4.0 star rating,"I stopped in here this past Saturday because I love oysters and remembered hearing about it opening up soon. I was borderline shocked at maybe 5:30 on a Saturday the bar seating was basically full and the many of the other seats were filling up as well. The inside was a nice/classy vibe. We ended up getting a dozen oysters from the 6 locations they had (4 east coast; 2 west coast) and I was very happy. They also have other light seafood options but the oysters were excellent. One of the staff was telling me they plan to rotate at least some of the locations, which really hope they do. Overall I thought it was excellent and will definitely be returning at some point in the near future.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"

The oyster selection is great but if you're not an oyster fan (acquired taste, I know), there's a variety of light bites... including the most colossal shrimp I've seen outside of NOLA. Prices are not cheap but I heard they have a good happy hour deal so that's an excuse to go back. Plus, a cute date spot.

The oysters were great, but the dirty martini was awful.  The drinks took longer to get Than the oysters, about 10 minutes or so, maybe a little more.  We felt like we were being rushed out because they were beginning to get busy on a Friday night. The bill can add up pretty quickly here and there's not many substantial sized items to make it a regular meal spot.",Stingray Lounge,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Cocktail, Bars,, Lounges"
