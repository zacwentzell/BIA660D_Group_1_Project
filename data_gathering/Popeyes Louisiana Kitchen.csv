1,5c3I70Jgr35sIE6Dlbf5Zg,Talibah T.,5.0 star rating,The workers were very fast. They made eye contact and they were very polite. I can see that the workers were working quickly and in sync to assure that the orders were accurate.The music on the radio was very nice and upbeat . The music matches the theme of Louisiana fried chicken!! Lol. Zydico I think the music is called. Over all this was a great place.Good service. Fast.. Clean.. Yes..

2,oAlFtNE1nC2gSCyojiDKRA,Miracle F.,5.0 star rating,"The other day was my first time at this location and it was a nice experience. The food was fresh, although there was a little wait but even a fast food restaurant gets backed up when busy. Especially during the lunch rush, but the employees were sweet and apologetic. Overall a great location.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
3,zZ8EFhZ1dJkrLfV7iUo55Q,Jonathan N.,1.0 star rating,The food and the staff are amazing. And the place is very clean. Theirs nothing bad to say about this location but 1 huge issue that they were serving unpacking straws. They had two boxes and customers were going up to the counter taking straws. You never know what that person did or touched to stick their hands in the box of straws.,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"

5,gjQvWPOi-FEhN35YPnB7Pg,Barbara M.,4.0 star rating,"Every time I have gone to this eatery I have enjoyed myself. It's such a festive environment. It's clean, it's bright with lots of parking.  The workers try hard to get the food out to you and  you could tell they are just learning the ropes. I have always gotten piping hot chicken and sometimes when the worker realizes that I was waiting for a while then I would find an extra treat in my order. It's not necessary but I liked the gesture. The chicken is delicious. I like the spicy chicken. There has always been plenty of seating and the staff pay attention to the garbage cans and the cleanliness of the tables. The bathroom was in pretty good shape too. But nothing  beats the sound of NOLA brass bands playing while you eat rice and beans (a tad too salty ) and drink sweet tea (a tad too sweet. And the string beans taste my grand moms green beans. That was a pleasant surprise.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
6,s8zoOf5r64mA2Xg2w7M8lg,Alicia B.,5.0 star rating,"Writing this review just as support for the employees who work here. Today was my first time eating here and I just want the employees to know how well they handled the situation with the psycho angry customer who rudely asked them to make another piece of chicken because his didn't ""look fresh"", that was complete bs. I was super bothered at watching how horrible he treated the cashier. The employees handled it in a calm manner and immediately began to make him his special ""new piece of chicken""... I hope he reads this review one day and realizes what a crappy human being he is. Not sure how he's never been in any trouble with that kind of behavior. FYI, this place looks pretty clean, you get fast service and there's parking right in front.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
7,u0Jk8dzL8v22swTvaZJwJg,T M.,4.0 star rating,"Great service! The person taking my order was friendly, and the woman fulfilling my order let me know what pieces were left (as they had just run out of a particular piece), asked the cook how much longer for more chicken, he said 5 min, and she asked me if I wanted to wait. I was so hungry I told her I was fine with whatever they had to fill the box! . Definitely going back and have been back to this location.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
8,gKTvHSqTE_llh4wSWfa_Pw,Yameci M.,1.0 star rating,Don't go here. The employees don't know what they are doing. They have a whole bunch of food out yet they are just look at each other like they don't know what to do while there are 10 people just waiting for their food. No reason why it should take over 15 minutes to get Popeyes chicken.,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
9,wTosfZqbcwEvlT4pplvhWA,Super B.,1.0 star rating,I've been at this place 3 times and there's always total chaos. The wait time is outrageous. The employees are totally lost. This new establishment has no managers... and if they do they sure don't act like managers. The chicken taste old or as if it was fried in old burnt oil. The biscuits were hard as a rock. I'm definitely getting my Popeyes somewhere else!,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"

11,Xpro0uwCWr6_CLG-h0BWaA,Nina A.,1.0 star rating,"I've come here several times because I love popeyes. This location is way too convenient to my house, so i try not to eat it all the time. The manager is pretty rude, and comes off as arrogant. He clearly doesnt really care about the customers. Ive seen him roll his eyes and just carry on with meaningless conversations with the staff. The first couple of times ive come here the chicken has been good, but other times the chicken clearly had been left out too long. Dry spots on the meat is very off putting. I think Im done visiting this popeyes location.. until maybe they can get their act together..",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"

Food was very good, but I had to wait a long time for it. The management was very unorganized and rude. Maybe next time I'll have a better experience with this location.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
13,D8f1lpbt8fo0vo17nPlo5w,Angel O.,1.0 star rating,"prices are too high. when i ordered the 12 pieces combo it doesn't  come with soda for the price of $31.89 ?? and it doesn't come with soda. what type of combo meal is that? any one eating needs soda to go along with it. a total rip off.... and on top of that the employees doesn't  have any idea of what they  are supposed  to do.  i ordered. i was #35 and they just kept me there for almost 30 minutes and every body up to #45 were being dispatched their orders skipping the order by number.. total chaos.  horrible place to visit...today as of 4-25-2017, i went there to get the tuesday special , which consists of 2 pcs of chicken one leg and one thigh for $1.49 plus tax, those pieces of chicken for the tuesday special are the left over from the previous mondays, i ordered 3 orders and they were all dry, refried very burn and dark which tells you that those pieces of chicken are old. taste horrible.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,2.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Chicken, Wings"
