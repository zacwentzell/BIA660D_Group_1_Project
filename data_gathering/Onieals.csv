It's always packed and after reading yelp reviews, it makes sense why! When we were looking for a place to eat dinner for our date night, Onieals was at the top of our list.The seating is very limited, but thankfully we came on a Sunday night and it wasn't very crowded. We were seated in the dining room and given menus to make our choices for dinner. We were sitting for 15 minutes before asking if we wanted anything from the bar and if we were ready to order - this is where they lost a star for me. We saw waitresses constantly visiting other tables, but felt that our waitress had neglected us. We didn't even get bread for our table. When we were finally seen, we ordered their hummus and The Wall Streeter burger with monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. The hummus came out with warm, lightly toasted pita, which was perfect since we were starting to develop a strong sense of hunger by this time. The hummus very blended, so if you're into chunkier hummus, you might not like the texture/consistency. I usually like chunkier hummus, but found the balance of acid with the chick peas to be perfect. My burger came out exactly as ordered and the bacon was crisp to perfection. I understand now why people claim that Onieals has the best burgers in Hoboken.Overall, I would come back for dinner the next time I was in the mood for a burger in the neighborhood.

When you walk in, it's an upscale bar with a small seating area in the back. They don't take reservations but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes for a table. Service was quick as servers were attentive. After having read reviews on the non-burger food, we decided to order two burgers for entrees and the penne vodka appetizer. Surprisingly, we both liked the penne vodka appetizer more than our meals. For burgers, we got the The Ragin Cajun and the Wallstreeter. The meat within the burgers itself is cooked well but the burgers themselves are very plain and come with a store bought bun. The Wallstreeter was better than the Ragin Cajun as the Ragin was actually a bit try even when adding the sauce. For drinks, I liked the Mexican Mule.

I had their Cajun chicken sandwich but my chicken was pounded to paper thin size, so unfortunately I felt like I was getting jipped  from the price. Also it uses the wrong type of bread..it was served on a fairly tough baguette, I think it would taste better if it was on a roll. The flavor combo is very good though still! I've sat inside where the staff was great, but when sitting outside it seems like service slowed quick a bit. There were times I'm pretty sure my waitress forgot about us, I had to go inside to ask for the check.

It was ideal for enjoying a quiet meal outside whilst people watching. Sidenote- they are dog friendly! Several patrons had their pups beside them at the tables, and the server even brought out water for them, I appreciated that.Their beer menu is a little lacking. They had a longer list of bottles but on tap they only had a handful. Nevertheless I tried an IPA recommended  by the server and I loved it so I was happy. For food the loaded nachos were great, nothing unique or more special than your standard nachos but they were cooked and prepared perfectly (not soggy, cheese melted, all the accoutrements included) so again, I was very satisfied. For my main I got the veggie burger with sautéed mushrooms and onions which was served on a baguette with fries. Although the bread was nice I would have preferred a regular burger bun. Somehow it didn't compliment it very well to me, also the burger itself was dry and lacked seasoning. I suspected it was once a frozen patty, but still it wasn't the worst I've ever had. My boyfriend had a massive burger which was awesome. I would suggest ordering a burger as they have a wide selection on their menu and they are massive!I would definitely return to try out some other options on their menu.

I split the Alps burger and the Ragin' Cajun burger with a friend, and while it tasted fine and reasonably well prepared, I found the patties to lack any distinctive flavor. I preferred the Ragin' Cajun between the two, but that might have been due to the remoulade and the texture from the crispy onions and not because of any different flavors due to the ingredients.

I ordered rotini bolognese instead of spaghetti bolognese and it was absolutely delicious...like I'm still not over how much I loved it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the bolognese had such a generous amount of meat in it. I'm a big eater and I thought the portion was huge. I almost didn't finish but I managed to eat every last bit of it because it was that good...and only $13. My mom ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it.

The layout is nice in that the bar was in the front where it was a lot noisier but in the dining area it was a little quieter, still lots of noise but better than the bar area. Once seated, the service was really slow; about 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order, again perhaps due to the rush hour? I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt. As for the food it also took a while to come out but it was delicious so worth the wait! I love my burger; asked for medium rare and they cooked it just right. The sauce and the lettuce and tomato all came on the side so you can add it as desired.   The penne pasta and nachos-no words! Absolutely delicious, never had simple pasta tasted so good.

The lady who took our order was really nice and took our drink, food order. Now comes the underwhelming part. We order a ""Manmosa"" (Onieals version of a Mimosa) & a ""Knot your Coffee (their version of the ol' Irish Coffee). Both the drinks were equally disappointing. While the ""Manmosa"" was a heavily watered down Mimosa served in a mug (probably a beer mug), while the Irish Coffee was served in a wine glass with a clear section of coffee and a floating layer of alcohol. While we sipped on the disappointing drinks, we were informed that the food will be further delayed, since the kitchen was backlogged. This was surprising since the place was less than 60% filled at that point. However, after another 40minute wait, we received the food. The french toast which my wife ordered was as described and good. However the bread on my chicken sandwich was too hard, I could barely bite into it.

I then came back and my wine I just paid for 2 min earlier was gone and when I inquired upon the bartender with the short blonde hair (the one that literally just served me the drink), she was turned around and literally Said ""earmuffs"" as in ""I don't purposely hear you"". Now, I was not by any means rude nor intoxicated but just literally paid for a drink AND tipped bartender then given cold shoulder cause the clock just stroke 2am. Now I have lived in Hoboken and bartended in Hoboken for 11 years and would never want to negatively peg a bartender but I was just simply shocked. I would never just randomly toss a customer's beverage and then purposely act ignorant to their cause immediately after, just the most insulting customer service I could think of. It is shocking and rude and more importantly scandalous as she took my generous tip and then dumped out my drink seconds later while happily collecting her nice tip. This bartender closing late Wednesday evening certainly ruined my otherwise great night but most importantly  ensured I will never step foot in this scam place ever again.

The wait time and service depends greatly on the time you go - I think this place is great for happy hour on a weeknight. On a weekend it becomes your typical packed bar, with pretty long waits for drinks and limited seating. The beer menu is extensive, and the wine list has enough options that I just had them make recommendations. They've got TVs if you want to watch sports, and I feel like the fact that Onieals is a few blocks off Washington lends itself to an older, calmer crowd.The food was great - a few of us got the NY strip, which was perfectly cooked with a great sauce, and some other friends had the burgers which were also on point.

Beware, the portions are pretty huge!  Service was good minus the hostess: they don't take reservations so our friends went early to wait for a table for the 4 of us. They waited 30 minutes when a table came available. Our friends explained we were a 3 minute walk from the restaurant but she would not give them the table since the 4 of us weren't there.

The food is always delicious and drinks are generally on point too. I'm not a huge fan of their bloodies, but they serve manmosa's (the oh so delicious marriage of OJ, vodka and blue moon) so it's not an issue for me.Recently, I celebrated a monumental occasion at Onieals. I've been a fleeting vegetarian (fish eater on and off for the last few years) for eleven years (!) and when I decided to rejoin the world of the burger eaters, Onieals is where I choose to enjoy my first. This was no small decision - both Minetta tavern and Bar Boulud were in the running - but it was unequivocally the right one. As many reviewers have stated before me, the burgers at Onieals are AMAZING! My current favorite is the Californian with cheddar instead of swiss, but I've been steadily making my way through their impressive list.

I have been in Hoboken for about 5 years and had always heard great things about Onieals particularly the burgers.  So my girlfriend and I finally decided to try it.  I would have to say it was one of the worst burgers I have had in Hoboken, JC and NY.  The reviews were so positive and even recommended to my by a co-worker but I would never return here. The place is smaller and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The staff was nice as well as the bar/restaurant area. We ordered the spicy pasta as an appetizer which was al dente close to raw. It was under cooked by I would say at least 3 minutes.  The sauce itself was actually very flavorful but under cooked pasta ruined the dish. For our burgers I ordered the Wallstreeter and my girlfriend ordered the Californian burger.  Both tasted of nothing but a big ball of grease.  The fries were decent but still extremely greasy.  The burgers had no taste other than oil.  Extremely disappointing and on the verge of inevitable.  We actually went to Cabana afterwards for dinner because we were still hungry. I am confused by all of the great reviews here. I'm convinced that since people have to wait a long amount of time, they spend that time at the bar.  By the time the food arrives, they are in a different state of mind.  This is the only conclusion I can come to because the food here is an embarrassment.  Would not recommend and definitely would not return.",Onieals,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars"

Thank goodness I live a block away.  Their nachos are amazing and always smothered in just the right amount of cheese and toppings.

OF COURSE the moment we arrived they had been slammed 5 minutes earlier so we had a wait.  Not terrible.  We grabbed a bloody mary from the nice bartender... She was not gross.  The drink was.  I forgot to request shelf vodka and got shitty rail stuff which wouldn't have been so terrible but the mix was terrible too.  I also hate when I have to request a lemon and olives in a bloody- they are a standard.  We got a nice little unstable table in the corner of the dining area and the waitress was there within seconds before we got to read the menu.  She had to run back and check the soup of the day and when she got back a minute or two later we ordered an appetizer but wanted a few to decide on lunch.  Ten minutes later she came back to get our lunch order and another 5 passed before the app came.  We had all ordered soup and waited another 10 minutes for that.  When our food came... it was average at best.  The burgers looked good and juicy.  The salad was really nothing special and the turkey club was lunch meat turkey which was disappointing as my dad was hoping for carved turkey.  We were really hungry when we arrived and really left nothing on the plates.  I wasn't upset about the wait for the table, the wait for the ordering the wait for the food or even the fact that we had to go to the bar to get our check and never saw our waitress again until we were walking out the door; but, it was a lot of time for anyone in a hurry this wouldn't be a good choice!!  I'm not high maintenance but I know there's too many excellent places around to settle for good places in terms of food AND service.  Average doesn't get second visits.",Onieals,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars"

""Is this real life?"" we all wondered.  We all were extremely disgusted, disturbed, appalled, stunned - I can't even think of all of the words to explain how we felt.  We were excited for our friend who just finished chemo one month ago, and to hear that the waitress DOUBTED something like that is beyond words.  How rude, insensitive, and sick of this human being.  We all got up and left the restaurant.  When the (woman we soon after found out was) manager saw us get up and leave our table, bottle of champagne poured and all, she gave our group the middle finger (on both hands, might I add) and called us c*nts as we stormed out of the restaurant. I went back in to ask for the name of the waitress, and nobody that worked there would give it to me.  I then spoke to the manager who defended her waitress, saying that people come in there and say things all the time so it's hard to believe people.  Why, in a million years, would anyone lie about CANCER? What would we gain by saying that someone went through one of the most gruesome things in the world?I cannot believe that 1. people like the waitress (and manager) exist, and 2. the manager at this establishment was not more sensitive to the situation.  She didn't care that the feelings of my friend (and the rest of us) were beyond hurt considering she spent the last 7 months undergoing chemotherapy; she didn't care that her waitress forced 4 customers out of the restaurant in a fury; she did not care about anything - not even the reputation of the establishment that she is ""managing.""Neither of these (monstrous & despicable) women have clearly ever had a loved one go through something like cancer.  I have never been so horrified and appalled in my life as I was with these women.I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",Onieals,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars"

At any rate, O'Nieal's fit the bill.I arrived first around 6:30pm, and it was very quiet, not crowded, and full of middle-aged people. Not much talent in the men department for my friend. I was worried that my Yelp research had steered me wrong, and started thinking about the escape hatch to Washington St. However, as time went by, a band started playing 90's covers, the place filled up, and by the time my friend arrived, it was lively and had some possible boy-o's among the local crowd.So the $5 wine special (all night) is amazing, and they have Pinot Grigio, Sauv Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay, and Torrontes as white choices. We also split some nachos and a quesadilla at the bar. I was really impressed with the nice fresh garlicky guacamole, and the food was solid bar food in general. It's about a 10 minute walk to the PATH train, which is a good distance to start walking off said bar food.

They have a full bar with a few tv's. the space is pretty tiny and it was crowded so it felt cramped. The bar was busy but they had only one poor girl slinging mimosas and blood Mary's for all the thirsty Hoboken 20 something's.  She definitely needed some help judging by the amount of dirty glasses piled up at one end if the bar. She was doing her best but I had to wait a bit to finally catch her eye and order a drink.  2 bloody Mary's at almost 8 dollars a pop not really worth it in my opinion.  The host stand is toward the back of the bar room and we put our name down to get a table.  Their is only 2 seats to wait for a table so say a little prayer before you step inside in hopes you don't have to wait.  The seating area is tiny but not cramped.  The pictures that line the wall are very cool.  Photographs of different celebrities in strange poses and making odd faces adds a nice appeal.  The brunch menu has a breakfast section and a sandwich/burger section.  I was happy with my Cajun chicken sandwich, I just wish they would have used real guacamole instead of something out of a package.  Otherwise the food was flavorful and those with me all enjoyed their eggs.  Food prices were decent for the quality.  With all of the brunch establishments in Hoboken you should shop around and find which one you like best.  Onieals is certainly tasty but not my fav.",Onieals,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars"

Mostly for dinner or lunch but a couple times for brunch. The food is decent here, the burgers are pretty great and the fries are good. Their other sandwiches are kind of hit or miss. I've had a variety, but if you eat here choose any of the burgers if going for a sandwich.Brunch was kind of meh nothing to write home about, I'd rather go to Anthony Davids, Elysian Cafe or La Isla. But it's close and has outdoor seating.Dinner service again is hit or miss. Last time we went, on a Monday evening. They wouldn't sit me until my fiance arrived, the place was literally empty in the back room and unless they expected a hoard of two tops to walk in in the next 10 minutes, customer service wise I should have grabbed a table. Especially while the three hosts sat there texting. Fine, you have policies, I get it. This last time we went because it was close and we didn't want to make a night of going out to eat. We were there for an hour and a half and we weren't drinking. The ticket time for a buffalo chicken salad and a turkey sandwich was over 40 minutes. We actually were about to leave when the food finally came. Our waitress never apologized, never explained what was going on and never checked in. I could tell she knew it was taking too long but she avoided it. I didn't want free food but an apology for taking 40 minutes would have been nice. It was obvious my fiance's sandwich had died under the heat lamp the fries were hard as rocks and the sandwich was too. My salad was just ok as well, not worth waiting for 40 minutes.They never really have specials to speak of unless you sit at the bar, which is tiny about 10 stools. Most places will extend happy hour to other seats especially outdoor seating, but they don't.The outdoor seating is pleasant right next to church square.

FOURTY FIVE minutes later, we were actually served food. How is that acceptable? We just got two entrees (one of which was a salad) and an app. The waitress was nice, but after coming in to check on us asking ""how is everything,"" it got hard not to sarcastically reply, ""you mean our water and table bread? it's phenomenal....""On to the food. Our mozzarella sticks which were served ON a plate of marinara sauce. I had never seen fried food served ON a bed of liquid sauce before. They usually come separate. Needless to say, after a few minutes, the batter was soggy from soaking in sauce for 10 minutes. But that didn't even matter, because the mozzarella itself tasted like FREEZER BURN. It was clearly frozen for way too long, and the after taste was disgusting. But, to avoid being a diva, we sucked it up and didn't say anything. Then, after another eternity, our food finally came. The burger was decent - no complaints there, but my salad was beyond disgusting. It was a densely packed bed of salad leaves with balsamic dressing the consistency of lard. I mean, it looked like jelly instead of creamy dressing. I really could have had a better experience eating Wendy's one dollar side salads. i ate one bite and just could not go on.Anyway, i guess you could argue that this is a bar, and you can't expect a good salad. To their credit, i did mention that the burger was decent. BUT, if you can't get fried cheese right, and your salad makes me gag, I think you need to re-assess the menu and stick to what you do best - burgers and fries - rather than put people through a painfully long wait time and gross appetizers for a thundering disappointment when the entree comes.

Anyway- Best bar in Hoboken- I know that is not saying much- but if you happen to find yourself in the land of high fiving- crooked hat wearing - deuches- this is your spot. Service is excellent. Friendly. Swift. When you finish your drink, they ask if you want another one. I know that this is a simple concept, but a lot of places and bartenders seem to mess it up. Not at O'Neiaielll's.

There's a nice selection of wines and draft beers, cool photography in the dining room, and a great outdoor seating area where the servers will ask if they can bring water and treats for your dog. The brunch is the bomb, as is the 3 B's (Blackened, Bacon, Bleu) burger. The pup and I both love the fries. For a while I suffered an unhealthy addiction to their blackened chicken sandwich, which always needed to be accompanied by an extra side of guac and a pint of Allagash White.

Very kind and courteous wait staff, willing to go above and beyond. We were 15min late but they had a table already set up for us when we got there. The outdoor table was not to our liking because the air conditioner blew water on it at times, but they happily relocated us to a different outdoor table, no questions asked. The cocktails were strong and reasonably priced, and the food was expertly prepared. My mother had The Eggs Sardeux and I had the Church Square. Both were fantastic!

276,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,3.0 star rating,"WARNING: This review might be more of a story than a review. Read for your own enjoyment! This week, tragedy struck my apartment. I live with four guys, and more often than not, things get carried away and stuff gets broken. Recently, one of my larger and less graceful roommates (let's call him Moe Mullivan) spilled (and by spilled I mean dumped) a glass of water all over our cable box. While Moe claims it was an accident, the malicious intent I could see in his eyes lead me to believe otherwise. This heinous attack left our apartment separated from the world, which was probably his plan all along. In order rectify the situation, we had to trek into the depths of Hoboken to the optimum online office to replace the busted box. Because it was such a difficult journey, I decided to have a rest stop at Onieals to rest up and recharge. Located across the street from scenic Church Square on the corner of 4th and Park, this restaurant/bar is pretty unassuming without any large or flashy signs on the outside. The interior atmosphere is as relaxed as the exterior, which lends Onieals to be a nice meet up spot. They have a moderately sized bar area and a separate seating area with about 10 tables. Because it is off the main street, there wasn't much of a lunch crowd, which let my guests and I converse comfortably. However, with such a small crowd, I expected the service to be better than it was, but then again, I suppose it added to the relaxed atmosphere. Onieals offers your typical bar food, sandwiches, burgers, etc, but with a larger selection. At about $10 an entrée, I sampled their World Famous Burger, a sandwich, and a vegetarian sandwich between my guests and me. I will reserve me personal feelings for establishments calling their dishes world famous (seriously, who gets to decide that), but their burger was pretty good. It came with all the usual fixings like lettuce, onions, and tomatoes, and a side of fries. The burger was cooked a perfect medium and the meal left me feeling satisfied. My guest had the Church Square Sandwich which was a turkey, guacamole, and Monterey Jack cheese sandwich served with a side of fries. My other guest had the Foccacia Club which was an open faced sandwich that has a variety of grilled vegetables topped with melted mozzarella cheese served with a side of chips. Both felt that the sandwiches were better than your average bar food, which I can certainly agree with. Too many times I lower my standards for bar food because usually you either get a good bar, a good restaurant, or neither. However, Onieals shows me I don't have to settle because bars can make delicious food if they want to. I haven't decided whether I should be thankful that Moe forced us on the Cablevision journey but I did learn two important lessons. First, keep your liquids and electronics separate, and second, never let go of your standards. If only I could get Moe to learn the same lessons and keep him from watching his True Blood and Tool Academy. The Bottom Line: Onieals raises the bar for food. So if you are looking for a bite to eat and a bit to drink, then consider walking down and trying them out.",Onieals,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars"

Argh!I was glad I got over it, though. The menu here is huge and both times I've dined here I was really happy with my meal. Their veggie burger is made in-house, and all of their burgers can be subbed for the veggie version. Fries are awesome, too. Service in the dining room was very good last time I was here. Even though we were the only ones inside and it was a bit late, the server was really friendly and we weren't rushed at all. The dining room is also decorated stylishly, kind of an Old Hollywood vibe. On the other hand, once when I ate at the bar I was a little put-off. Our bartender finished her shift just after our meals were served. She then sat down beside us with a friend to drink and eat dinner. I still tipped 20%, and understand they probably pool, but I felt a little weird tipping someone who was sitting right next to me like a regular customer.

While I try to take him somewhere new every time he comes down, we often find ourselves here if he wants a burger, few beers and not a lot of loud and obnoxious people at the bar for a Sunday Funday. O'nieals always seems to be my go to when he wants something quick, easy and in the neighborhood or for myself if just want to grab a drink or two and something to eat after a late night at work, not in the mood to cook etc., I always suggest the fried mozzarella and a burger. They have a great selection of draft and bottled beers, however I'm impartial as they have Warwick Winery's' Doc Cider which I typically go in for. Warm atmosphere, great bar staff and regulars are all chill. I consider this one of the secret bars of Hoboken. It's far enough off Washington and in midtown versus down near 1st and Newark that visitors don't typically tend to be here.
