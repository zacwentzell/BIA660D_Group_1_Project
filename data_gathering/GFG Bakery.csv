1,QxTNaHoxTL8f7jAK5nwQ1g,Nicholas G.,4.0 star rating,"Delicious greek bakery and as authentic as you will find in america in terms of taste. If you want a taste of something you normally would not find in america order the bougatsa. There is the savory and sweet one. Order the sweet one it is magnificent. Get it with sugar/cinnamon on it. It is a fillo pastry with a creamy sweet custard inside. It has the perfect balance of flavor but isnt necessarily the healthiest thing. We also tried the tiropita (cheese pie) which was also awesome. You know when a tiropita is bad when the cheese is salty but this was not. It was well balanced and great. I will say it is definitely overpriced and that is one of the only issues i had.  If we are comparing authenticity in terms of price this does not compare to a real greek bakery. A real greek bakery is an ""every-mans"" place where you can get great pastries at a good price.  I understand we are in america so that is why i did not penalize the place too much. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting an authentic taste of greece but bring your wallet!!The prices are a little expenisive but with the skilled labor and rent I can understand. This is not a place you can come every day but it is a place worth visiting every week.",GFG Bakery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Greek,, Sandwiches"

I'd come here just for a frappe (Greek iced coffee). It was excellent and I don't know anywhere else to get one. I will say that the prices are on the high side.

The ambiance is pleasant, with lots of space to sit with a laptop and do work, the wifi is fast and free. I imagine it is perfect for the people who work in the surrounding buildings on River Street.I entered and was immediately greeted by the staff ready to take my order at the counter, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, and you could tell they cared about their product.

The pastries are displayed in cases in the middle of the space, and each looked more scrumptious than the next. First of all, five stars for the service. As I stood around the display case drooling over the pastries, unsure how to order them, a super friendly employee approached me and asked if she can be of any help. I wish I remembered her name. She was knowledgeable, friendly and offered me samples of some of the Greek sweets I've never had before.  I brought a heart shaped strawberry/chocolate and an orange/chocolate cake, as well as a piece of the strawberry blondie. The presentation is gorgeous, even down to the silver glittery pastry box. However, I would only give one star for the taste. Both cakes were way too sweet, I took one bite each and threw them away, what a of a waste of $12....  The strawberry blondie was good, not amazing, but slightly above average.  Bottom line, five star service and presentation, but only one star for taste.

As a first generation American with a Greek mother and Sicilian father, I am always excited to try new places that are authentic and celebrate my heritage. First off, they scored points by the fact that they are run by Greeks and native speakers. Often times, you have someone appropriating a concept who do not know the culture that well and are not in touch with the heritage. Believe it or not, it matters and you feel the love and pride in the food. I had the cheese pie and some baklava, delicious. If I could have eaten more, I would have, but you know, the stomach only stretches so much.The restaurants itself is immaculate and spacious and modern and bright. Such a pleasure to sit down and eat.

41,EVwT9lleIRE9JB-kRNs0Ng,Stacey T.,3.0 star rating,"*3.5 Stars*This is a new restaurant in Hoboken and a welcomed new addition.  It is clean, spacious, open and nicely decorated.  The staff is friendly, everything looks amazing and what I've had so far is delicious!The 3.5 stars is attributed to the prices.  For example, a piece of spanakopita comes out to over $7 after tax.  A piece of baklava is about the same.  Soup and a bottle of water comes out to over $10. I'd like to eat here more often, but the prices are quite high, even for the area.  There is a large assortment of pastries, sandwiches and other phyllo dough items, but if you have dietary restrictions the options are limited.  It would be nice if they had some more ""light fair"" options.  I've only seen 2 different salad assortments, everything else is pretty carb heavy.",GFG Bakery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Greek,, Sandwiches"

After seeing ads all over on Instagram, I decided to check out GFG bakery today with few of my friends. The size of pastries in a Greek bakery never disappoints me. The size of their croissants are twice the size from any of the bakery in the neighborhood. They taste was descent. I also ordered few pounds of their breadsticks for home, very reasonably priced. The chicken and potatoes was good, though I was a bit dissapointed with the amount of potatoes they gave vs the chicken and the presentation was a not pleasing at all. The coffees were average. The staff still need to get a hang of all they are serving. They were a bit clueless.",GFG Bakery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Greek,, Sandwiches"

They have samples for some of their cookies too.Services -- The staff is Greek (beautiful accents and all) and very welcoming, they were patient and helpful in explaining all the items they have.  It is a bit daunting to walk in see all the items wall to wall.",GFG Bakery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Greek,, Sandwiches"

The egress and the signage is weird - it feels like there are three different bakery sections so it's hard to navigate and the baked goods are mediocre at best.

The coffee is also a must-try (my favorite in all of Hoboken, and again reasonably priced!) The staff is very helpful and someone is always walking around making sure you're being taken care of.

I work in the area and that is the only reason I've given it a few chances. The pastries are good, definitely overpriced, but I really wanted to leave a review because the smoothies are terrible and the ice cream bar was extremely strange. Although they have an ice cream/yogurt bar that gives people access to it, someone came over and insisted on serving us.

Plenty of breads and desserts but as far as a small meal that was it. I asked if the rest of their extensive menu could be ordered and the guy told me they stopped providing the meals at 5pm. Mind you they close at 9:30 p.m.  Why would you stop serving your food menu before people even left for work, and 4 hours before you close?? Very bizarre. Didn't try the Greek yogurt bar or the dessert but seemed a little on the expensive side",GFG Bakery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Greek,, Sandwiches"
