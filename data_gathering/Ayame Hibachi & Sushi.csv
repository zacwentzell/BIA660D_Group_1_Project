The restaurant was entirely too small for the amount of tables/chairs in there, but I guess they make it work. There is no way this restaurant is up to code lol. Our group sat at a table in the back, half of us slammed with our backs against the wall. The food was very good and they put on a great show. However, there was a huge bug crawling on the wall next to me after my meal, and I was too crammed to move! This was likely a one off situation, but still... it was not an ideal way to end a meal. If you're in Hoboken and want Hibachi, this is your only option. Not great but okay.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2,Vr94oCgVobXtkrRkg1i3PQ,Jane Y.,4.0 star rating,"I've only been to two sushi restaurants in Hoboken, and this one is my favorite thus far. My only ""negative"" thing to say about Ayame Hibachi & Sushi is that due to its tight space, the hibachi grills make the restaurant warm and stuffy so those who are there for sushi only.  Everything else is pretty great.  They offer a vast selection of rolls, many of which are creative, their sushi is delicious, and they have a creative selection of sushi appetizers.  To start our evening, we popped open a bottle of sparkling rose (Ayame is BYOB) and shared the Salmon Skin Salad and the Avocado Mini Ball.  The Salmon Skin Salad was a perfectly executed - the salmon skin was crisp and warm while the leafy greens were cold and crisp.  The Avocado Mini Ball was just the right size for two to share - arriving in a shallow bowl, ours was marinated spicy white tuna (you have a variety of fishes you can choose from) tightly wrapped up in a skin of avocado slices.  It was served at room temperature which I personally wasn't a fan of, but it was tasty nonetheless.For our entrees, we shared three rolls, the Ayame Monster Roll, Cajun Tuna Tataki Roll, and the Out of Control Roll.  The Cajun Tuna Tataki Roll tasted like a hybrid California/Spicy Tuna Roll and didn't really stand out, but the Ayame Monster Roll and the Out of Control Roll were delicious - especially the Ayame Monster Roll!  All of the additional topping on each piece of the Ayame Monster Roll, especially the seaweed salad, greatly enhanced each bite making each piece delicious and completely satisfying.  And, what's not to like about deep fried shrimp tempura and soft shell crab wrapped into a roll?  In addition to the rolls, I had two pieces of sushi - one uni and one ikura and my friend had a hand roll.  While I cannot comment on the hand roll, I heard it was delicious, and each sushi piece, while I can't say were the freshest, they both melted in my mouth because the seafood quality was good.  Not only were our eyes hungrier than our stomachs, but each food entry was generous in portion and so we had roll pieces leftover that we packed up to go, and a few hours later they were still delicious!Service is always just as important to the dining experience as the food, and the staff here at Ayame is friendly and accommodating - we asked to switch tables and they were very gracious about it moving us without the bat of an eye, the table next to us had a toddler who smashed one of their plates to the ground and the staff totally kept their cool and didn't make the family feel bad, and they were great about forming new tables for customers to sit at without making those that were still eating their meals feel rushed and pressured to leave.  The next time I am in Hoboken and craving sushi, I will definitely be coming back!",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
3,sgk0J9CJiA9jaeZBNqCEhA,Steph R.,3.0 star rating,I been here twice the first time with a large group and I thought the food was good and the chef was very entertaining so a few years after I decided to give this place another try. In all honestly I don't think I'd go again. I rather order Chinese take out for less. I came here with my boyfriend on Easter night the place was empty and we were quickly seated the place is byob so that's a plus. The whole experience lasted 20 minutes we barley ate and took it to go we paid 70 with no dessert or appetizer the chef took about ten minutes cooking and he wasn't  even funny and the food wasn't good.  The worst part is receiving large portions of something that doesn't taste good. Maybe they had a bad day but the food was very salty and then the miso soup was super salty. It's not always quantity it's quality and I know it was bad because my brother eats anything and I realized after leaving it in the fridge for two days he only ate like three pieces of chicken.,Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For the record, my Hoboken sushi Top 3:  #1 - Okinawa.  #2 - Robongi.  #3 - Hmm, maybe you'd be better off ordering pizza?",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For the record, my Hoboken sushi Top 3:  #1 - Okinawa.  #2 - Robongi.  #3 - Hmm, maybe you'd be better off ordering pizza?",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We had just finished out dinner in the outdoor seating area, and I went inside to use the ladies room. While I was waiting for the restroom, I jumped as the rat ran right in front of my sandals and under a hibachi table. One of the waitresses saw the same thing as I did, and had no reaction whatsoever. I then saw the rat run under another table. I didn't wait for the restroom, I was just so grossed out that I wanted to get out of there. Before leaving, I pulled who looked like the manager aside, and told him what I had seen. He didn't speak the best English, so he didn't say much back to me. As he started looking under the tables, I left.

They didn't really handle it well. The communication was off. Then the habachi wasn't good- the qaulity of the rice alone was poor. The entire dish was drenched in sauce. It was disappointing.

I'm a fan of both places and order takeout regularly. The quality of the food is always spot on, and the costs for Hoboken are competitive. I always find it mind-boggling when I see no wait for outdoor seating at Ayame, but two stores down people at Robongi are waiting on the sidewalk. Ayame is BYOB (who doesn't like that?!), and the sushi is tasty and fresh. Also don't forget this is the only Hibachi place in town.... They cater for birthday parties and the chef pours sake into your mouths too sometimes! What I think is a steal is the ""maki combo""... 3 rolls for $13! Nobody can beat that! And it comes with soup or salad! I will admit the roll options for dinner are pretty basic, but I get around that by ordering the lunch special maki combo (lunch is considered 12-4 ) and that has way more roll options... and you get 3 rolls, soup, AND salad for lunch all for $12.If you don't want basic rolls like the maki combo offers, the special rolls are gigantic and well worth the money. There's also a ton of options on the menu to cater to your liking. My favorite menu item? Try the Tuna Dumplings... SO DELICIOUS!

Only reason we decided Hibachi was because my cousins had never had it before (shocking, I know). Con: Anyways, we had parked our car right in front of the place and STILL didn't recognize the place because the sign for it was SO small. We walked back and forth a few times until we realized it -_- We opened the door to a sweaty, disorganized, chaotic, and cramped room. In the tiny dining place they had crammed as many seats and tables as they possibly (there were 5 Hibachi tables). Our reservation was for 7:30pm and we were seated at 8:15pm which was kind of annoying that we had to wait, but it made sense because it was SO crowded (btw, we went on a Sat night). Con: Once we sat down we didn't have to wait too long to place our orders, however our waiter was so rude. My cousin had a few questions on the menu (because she had never had hibachi before) and he just mumbled with ""can you just place your order please"" he COMPLETELY disregarded her!!! wth! I understand it was busy, but that was no way to treat a paying customer. Pro: The food was really good! This is why I rated it 3 stars instead of 1. The chef was friendly, funny, and accommodating. Side note: The interior of this place def needs some remodeling. I noticed there were Christmas decorations up (random red stockings taped to the walls along with a wreath).

Our chef was absolutely beyond exceptional (That's you Frankie!) and gave us the ultimate hibachi experience. He not only made us all more than welcome to the restaurant, he connected with us and showed amazing skill with his art. I call it art because that's exactly what he made it out to be. Fire going everywhere (safely I might add), food flying everywhere, and laughter being a constant factor. The food itself was amazing and the one of us who got the sushi loved that as well.

What's nice is that this is a BYO, I picked up a cabernet from a shop a block away.We started with a Cajun Tuna Roll, because it was Fat Tuesday after all. The sushi was delicious, I'd order it again for sure. It was a spicy tuna roll topped with Cajun tuna and tabiko.I ordered the steak and salmon hibachi combo, with fried rice, noodles and mixed veggies. They started me off with a brothy soup that I wouldn't quite call miso soup. The Tepanyaki chef was not very talented, he was bored and was incapable of grabbing our attention. At one point my friend said that if the chef didn't do the volcano with the onion that we were walking out, I'm glad he opted to do the volcano. On the upside, the food was tasty.Right before we left, most of the patrons started coughing and we realized the place started smelling of vinegar. I guess they decided to clean their ovens during business hours and opted not to use any vents. When we asked them to turn on the vents, they stared at us and laughed... that's some customer service...Good food but that ending made me think this place is more suitable for takeout which isn't promising for a tepanyaki grill",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
80,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,2.0 star rating,"Oh Ayame you were A-OK I guess but the most recent experience causes me to say you are ""meh"". Knowing you're the only hibachi in town does not a great dining experience make. I have been 4-5 times here and every time is just kind of average. Now, if you are lucky enough to get at the Hibachi grills most of those chefs are pretty great and enjoyable. Most times we've been we have been larger groups.Now, this last time was New Year's Eve. Trust me I get it, large groups suck and can be a pain. I worked in the business I know the pain it  can sometimes cause. But, they are customers and should be treated accordingly. We had booked the reservation about a month out from Dec. 31st. And subsequently the person who reserved it called back 4 times between then to confirm and adjust numbers by 1-2. At around 1pm on the day of the reservation a not so friendly manager called to say they are going to cancel our reservation unless we gave them a credit card and charged us $100. This was never part of the deal. Basically they held our reservation for ransom. And the dude was a jerk about it.We suck it up and pay, because it's too late to get a reservation anywhere else except Johnny Rocket's for a large group, like I said...held for ransom. The manager was so nasty when seating us, aggressive and basically inconvenienced by the large group coming in all at once (per their request), he was yelling numbers out 10-12 how many do you have?! It was just awful service.The wait staff was pretty much non existent. They kind of took our order, just hovering over us and not even asking who they wanted to go next or, 'what would you like"" just standing there. It was awkward. Our meals came out piecemeal (pun intended of course), a hot dish here, a sushi dish here, nothing was consistent. They just literally yelled across the table what the order was until one of us raised our hands. The wait staff just weren't good. My food was ok, it was a chicken dish, it was kinda boring and I added a bunch of soy sauce. Everyone else liked their sushi. I don't eat it so I can't comment on that.When it came for the bill, they brought it to us without the already charged $100. We were not happy, so we said something and the jerky manager finally voided the original $100 charge. Well, after this debacle the original check didn't have gratuity added, but after we complained about the $100 magically gratuity was added. They knew how bad the were and they knew we were not happy. I would never stiff anyone but they were afraid we were.Overall I will never come back here after this service and so/so food.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They typically don't allow this, but if you tell them you are not that hungry and can only eat that much they generally let it slide. Don't order the shrimp as they give you a couple anyway.I also don't recommend ordering anything that's not hibachi, like sushi, but this is not a recommendation against their other stuff, hibachi is the best stuff they have.Hibachi is extremely good for groups, almost bad to not go in a group of at least 4.

Saw one of the hibachi chefs do a trick where his hat was supposed to light on fire and he ended up lighting up his whole back... hahaha and he was so boss about it and just walked off into the kitchen like nothing happened.

102,Lu60GaKNGWfZKhN6NTn_mA,Judy R.,1.0 star rating,"I give this place a 1 star because of the terrible service we received today. PARENTS, here is why I will never take my children back here again:Terrible rude SERVICE: When the waiter came to ask what we wanted he was so annoyed that we were not to order yet. 1) Ok our fault for being ~10 mins late to our reservation but there was only one other couple sitting in the restaurant (not at habachi table). 2) We have kids so it's not that easy to just sit down and order within a few mins. Besides, I double checked their website, they are open 12-10:30pm. So what if it's lunch time for the employees? If they don't want to serve customers during their lunch hr, then they should close the restaurant down for their lunch time!Our friends' 2-year-old was frightened by the fire trick and got scared every time the habachi chef made any kind of gestures with the spatulas. The chef kept making fun of him like ""awe, poor baby"" and ""awe just go to your mommy"". REALLY? The kid is 2 yrs old!!! Kids cannot help that the get scared! And he kept making snide comments. My fed-up point was when the chef said ""SHUT UP... ha haha"". REALLY, he said THAT?!?! However, if our friends were not going to say anything, I didn't think it was my place to say anything at the time. In retrospect, I really should have! That was so mean and unacceptable! #1 who says that to a customer? #2 who in their right mind would yell at a 2-yr-old like that?!? Even if it was a ""joke""!FOOD: We've eaten here a couple of times before and thought the food was okay. That's why we decided to take the kids there. But the habachi experience this second time around has left a BAD tasted in my mouth.  The sushi is standard: 3 stars (though I think Robongi is better). The habachi taste wise is 2.5 stars because my salmon was just a little too salty and dry for my taste. The noodles had no flavor except for the soy sauce flavoring. (And just for the record, my first time at Ayame was mediocre too but at least the chef didn't make fun of anyone.)In conclusion, I won't be coming back here as there are plenty of sushi restaurants in Hoboken that has similar or better food. And I am just annoyed with the TERRIBLE service.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It's noisy and fun inside where the hibatchi is, but we weren't here today for that - we were trying out the sushi. Dark inside, not particularly well-lit. Noisy, but not unbearably so. A TV above the sushi bar.The miso soup, right on target, though not enough tofu for me (it rarely is). The salad was cold and crispy under plenty of ginger dressing. And the edamame was salted just about right. They gave two soy sauce holders for the four of us - it's a good thing we were couples.  The appetizer of fried calamari rings was tasty, dipped in a slightly spicy apricot sauce.The chirashi... eh, it wasn't that exciting. The fish wasn't as good as I have had at other Japanese sushi restaurants, but it was a nice selection of a few different pieces, decently cut. The rice, though a nice touch with the roe and bonito flakes to make it crunchy, was a bit dry underneath. Biggest issue - lack of wasabi and ginger for the chirashi plate... not sure how you forget it, but they did.The chicken teriyaki... forget it. There's minimal flavor in the sauce, it's little more than soy sauce in a cornstarch gel on some grilled chicken breast and steamed veggies.One serious negative note - one of the group became sick from the food that night, even before she left the restaurant!

(Patience Level: 9)9:00PM -- I could't help but notice that each Hibachi table was occupied by a large party that hadn't even ordered yet, and one that just started to have their meal prepared.  I mention my observation to the manager, and noted that it was obvious we wouldn't be seated for some time.  He said, probably 20 minutes or so. Upset by the fact it should have been apologetically mentioned and was not, we decided to patiently wait another 20 minutes. (Patience Level: 6)9:20PM -- It is clear that the table who was having their food prepared was in the process of paying, and we would have a table shortly.  Then, to my surprise, a large group of about 15 girls came in from waiting outside, and appeared excited to sit at the opening table  I politely told one of them that it was likely our table since we had an 8:45 reservation, however, she informed me that it was certainly theirs because they had a 8:30.  Meanwhile, none of the other tables look anywhere near finished.  Now, they're testing my patience (Patience Level: 3)9:30PM -- I once again mention to the manager that this is a bit unacceptable, and his explanation is that ""people arrived late.""  I told him if that was the case, they should have lost their reservation, especially if it was late enough to cause a 45 minute seating delay.  He just rudely laughed at me. (Patience Level: 2)9:45PM -- I watch the manager tell one of the waitresses to put the pressure on one of the tables to pay their check and leave.  Great for me, horrible for that guest.  In their defense, most of the people still seated have paid and are simply drinking their BYOB shots/wine. (Patience Level: 1)9:55PM -- We are finally seated over 1h 10m late.  At this point I'm just happy to eat because I was starving upon arrival, but at the very least I am expecting a reasonable discount (10-15%) for such an unreasonable wait. I mention this to the manager and he agrees.  (Patience Level: 4)10:05 -- We place both our appetizer and entree orders, and within minutes a chef is beginning to prepare food. (Patience Level: 4)10:15 -- Our appetizers come out (couple sushi rolls) and they were mediocre at best. Simultaneously, we are served our hibachi entrees, which was just as mediocre.  For me this is a big no-no, and should be for anyone.  It makes you feel rushed, and any good, self-respecting restaurant knows this. They're obviously in a pickle, and having worked in a restaurant, I slightly sympathize.  (Patience Level: 3)10:35 -- We have finished out meals, and we ask for the check.  The check comes, and their is no discount applied.  I explain this to the waiter and he calls over the manager, who then asks me what the issue is, despite having agreed to compensate us for our ridiculously long wait.  He says he will be right back. (Patience Level: 1)10:40 -- The manager comes back to tell us he is not able to provide any kind of discount he originally agreed to.  I angrily express my discontent as respectfully as possible.  He then says ""If you want 15% off then don't pay a tip.""  It was then I absolutely lost it.  I could not believe that a restaurant manager would even consider suggesting we screw over an innocent (though, not so terrific) server, because of his inability to properly manage the place.  We paid our bill, and personally handed the waiter his tip in cash.

The waitress took our order, the food came, everything about that process was pretty standard.  I will mention, one of the people in my party attempted to order brown rice and the waitress was VERY adamant that she really should order the fried rice, it was very uncomfortable and considering the fried rice is two bucks more, very assumptive. The quality of the food was ehh. My noodles were significantly colder than everything else.  I've definitely had better tasting hibachi for the same price, the quality was definitely disappointing but it wasn't horrible.  HORRIBLE is what happened after we ate, so the bill comes and I guess for hibachi it's pretty standard.  There are four people in our party, we split the bill in half (two cards) and when the receipts returned to the table, the waitress had charged each card an additional TEN dollars, so pretty much, if we hadn't been paying attention, Ayame would have received a free $20 bonus, in addition to whatever percentage we were going to tip.  After talking to management, we were each refunded our $10.00 (in the form of cash) but only after it was suggested by staff to take that money and leave it for tip SMH!!! VERY FREAKING ASSUMPTIVE. What kind of logic is that? You over charge us $20, then instead of refunding the money initially, you suggest we just put that money towards the tip? What if we wanted to leave a cash tip? What if we wanted to tip more than that or less? We did get the money back though, but the ultimate turn off was when another waiter came to our table and asked us if we were going to leave a cash tip, I've never been asked that by a waiter before.  I understand the importance of tipping your waiter and if you're good, I'll hook you up but not only was the food mediocre and the service bleh, you are pushing me to tip, I don't need a friendly reminder. That's rude and uncomfortable.  Never going back to Ayame and I highly suggest, if you're craving hibachi, you don't either.xoxo,Court",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

She rolled her eyes at me, turned away and waved her hands at me while I was asking her questions and even while making orders (which she had to talk over from the register asking what our order was again because she didn't bother to listen to me beforehand), etc. Fyi, we were one of only two customers that were there so it wasn't even busy. Couldn't even enjoy our meals because of her glaring at us the entire time.

My friend got a Kani salad that really looked good. No one got sushi but I will be back to try it. The only reasons for the deduction of a star was they charged us for side noodles when we didn't order them (noodles are included with hibachi), and when we told them they took that off the bill and then added fried rice. My friend did order fried rice w/her hibachi (yes it's an extra $3...) but it felt like adding the noodles instead initially and then adding the rice they were trying to pull one over on us.

I tried thinking of a way to get the great Hibachi food without the Hibachi show. I decided to sit at the normal tables and just order off the Hibachi menu. The food came out quicker and just as good as the Hibachi chef making it in front of you. The sushi was fresh and delicious. There were a few rolls that were huge and packed a ton of ingredients. I am not complaining but just stating that they have some wonderfully designed rolls. For entree, I always get the steak and shrimp hibachi. It is amazing.

While I was sitting there in front of the owner/manager (place is pretty small), waiting for my friends, the owner/manager gave away my reservation without telling me. When my friends arrived the owner/manager said we'd have to wait since they were late. I understood at this point because my friends were late. We were still waiting for a hibachi table 45 minutes later!!! We should have left then. Our fault. Then the owner/manager told us that another table was being saved for a reservation (post reservation time). I guess not all reservations are equal since it was past their reserved  time. To make a long story short, birthday reservation at 8 pm. Friends arrived at 8:09 pm. Seated at 8:50 pm. Hibachi chef came to table at 9:40 pm.

They don't charge extra to substitute brown rice on anything, which is great - not to mention they have adorable outdoor seating. Their special rolls range from $10 - $15 each and the regular rolls are around $6 - $8.

148,igwa_uc7g_CQg0szVHKy-g,David B.,3.0 star rating,"Last week I trekked out to Hoboken, New Jersey to check out Hoboken's latest hibachi restaurant, Ayame.We arrived around 7 p.m. on a Friday night and the place was busy. There were some open spaces at the sushi bar and hibachi tables but aside from that, there was a wait to sit down. I recommend making a reservation.The inside of Ayame is equipped with a few hibachi tables in back - enough to comfortably fit our party of 14 - along with a sushi bar and some outdoor seating up front. There are no frills here and the inside mimics your typical Japanese or Chinese restaurant. The smell is a different story. The smell from the food cooking on the hibachi tables radiates throughout the restaurant and it sticks to you. Forewarning, be prepared to smell like Ayame for the rest of the night.Our hibachi chef for the night was Alan. He definitely doesn't look like an Alan, but who am I to argue. Alan was perfect for our large group. He was energetic, funny, interactive and had fun with us - exactly what I want in a hibachi chef and it helped make our night.There are a bunch of different options on the hibachi menu but all of them revolve around some sort of meat, chicken, seafood or combination.I ordered:    Combination of steak and scallops with fried riceAll hibachi meals come with two pieces of shrimp, soup or salad, and vegetables, all of which were delicious. As for the steak and scallops, they were tasty, but heavily doused in sauce which most likely disguised some of the natural flavor. The food was neither mind blowing or sub-par, but that's OK since I was there for the entertainment. Our hibachi chef, Alan, put on a show for us - flipping pieces of fried eggs into our mouths, squirting sake from a spray bottle into our mouths but instead dousing us in it (his aim wasn't that good), and flipping lots of food up into his awaiting hat.Word to the wise, Ayame is BYOB so make sure you stock up on wine, beer, sake or whatever you plan on drinking with your meal.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The uncomfortable chairs are placed way too low to the high table. In addition, the blasting techno music (as another reviewer mentioned) is not conducive to a relaxing atmosphere.We have eaten at many hibachi places and are also very accustomed to Japanese food. The food at this place was acceptable ... if you were actually served the meal you ordered.We came here for our farewell dinner with friends visiting from the Netherlands. Three of us ordered hibachi and one ordered sushi and something else. The hibachi chef was nice enough and did a few tricks as to be expected. However, it struck me as very strange that whilst we were halfway through eating our hibachi, not a single item of my friend's had arrived on the table. She was incensed as were we, but the worst part was that none of the staff thought it strange that she was sitting there with an empty plate! It's their job to make sure we are happy and we certainly weren't.When we were finally able to summon the waiter over, even though it was a nearly empty restaurant, we asked about our friend's food and the waiter didn't really answer, so we were left wondering what was going on. I suspect that part of the issue was the language barrier because our waiter's English comprehension did not seem the best. That said, that is no excuse for crappy service and rudeness because we received no apology whatsoever.When the food was finally brought over, three of us had actually finished our meals and my friend had pretty much lost her appetite because she was understandably so pissed off!We complained to the manager when he finally deigned to come over and his piss-poor proposal was to offer us ""free ice cream"" and, failing that, 10% off our bill. But what really incensed me was that he was full of excuses about some customers having special requests about food being brought at different times. Well, we didn't make any such requests and we made sure to tell him this.  As a businesswoman myself, I'm well aware that you can't afford to treat paying customers in this manner. If I make a mistake, I am the first to own up to it, apologise and make a serious offer to remedy it. This gentleman however was unable to see or admit that he had made a mistake. Read the other reviews about the poor service and you will see that this is unfortunately not a one-off. To top it all, as we walked out the restaurant, we were ignored and the manager didn't even bother to look up to bid us farewell.Ultimately, if they had admitted to their mistake and given us a proper apology, we might have graced their restaurant with our presence again, but as it stands there is no bloody way that we will ever darken their doors in the future.This review represents my subjective opinion based on my personal experience.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It tasted like the freezer it was stored in.  I ordered a sushi/sashimi platter and could hardly eat it. The tuna was horrific and I got sick at the restaurant as a result. To add insult to injury they informed us that they were closing early AFTER we sat down and they took our order.  The only thing half decent was the soft shell crab, and the specialty roll we ordered wasn't as disgusting as the rest of the food. Most likely because it was made with shrimp tempura and well masked by the rice. I eat sushi frequently and this was one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had.

165,wUeAGYUwfMGiTLmqkFLc8Q,Vicious G.,2.0 star rating,"One day, my friend and I were bored and decided to compare Ayame's sushi with Robongi's sushi FOR FUN. My friend and I have spent more than a year in Japan together for college and have a good knowledge of sushi. We knew that the quality would disappoint us but we just cannot understand how these places are have so much hype with such crappy sushi and high prices!! Ayame is a little (like maybe a dollar) cheaper than Robongi. First, they are not using sushi rice and the prices are too high for the low quality fish. I could just taste that the fish had been frozen. They could of made up for the quality by increasing portions they way non-Japanese sushi places usually do, but NO. We tried 4 different rolls but they were so unspectacular that I can only remember one of them -the spicy scallop roll. When you put the spicy sauce on sushi, it masks the flavor so that it is harder to tell if the sushi is not fresh which is why this roll stood out. Also, my friend and I agreed that Ayame's spicy scallop roll tasted better than Robongi's spicy scallop roll... but Ayame's other 3 rolls were worse than their competitor two doors away. Also, everyone who works here is Chinese and confused. This place is far from authentic. The kanji (Chinese characters) on the front of the store does not read AYAME!  should read Yamamizu or Sansui. While I was paying, I asked the lady at the counter in a nice cheerful way if they were hiring because my friend speaks fluent Japanese- the lady gave me a dirty look and said scolded no at me like I had just begged her to give me some money! I later found out from neighboring businesses that she is the owner's wife.  So that's 1 star service but since I did not have to throw up my sushi, I am going to be generous and give them 2 stars.

My friends and I were repeatedly asked if we were done with our food after 20min of receiving it. They seemed to be rushing us which was the first strike. The bill came and we asked for it to be split. Once we received the split checks, we noticed the waiter added an additional money to the checks. Strike 2. We told him about the extra charge and he seemed confused about it until about 15 seconds later he realized his ""mistake."" Once the bill was corrected, the waiter hawked my table down as just a few feet away as we signed off on the bills. We had not gotten up to leave our table yet and the waiter comes rushing to out table, snatches the receipt off the table to see if their was a tip. Stike 3. I was disgusted with this behavior and based on other reviews, Ayame needs to properly train their waiters in common courtesy and hospitality. They made me feel utterly uncomfortable. FOODDecent.

I do have to agree that their music was a strange choice. It made me feel like I should be fist-pumping at some club at the Jersey Shore. Definitely messes with the ambiance. Also they had a NASCAR race on the tv- Definitely strange. But other than that I really do like this place",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We ordered the tuna mango salad, aged tufo and grilled squid and thought it was really good but the waitress took forever to bring us a few things that we asked 4 times.I am happy with the food so far, so I decided to order the sushi deluxe...THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE!!!  Ate one bad piece of sushi and had to ran to the bathroom and vomitted everything out. Meanwhile my husband paid the bill and then told the manager that I ate a really bad piece of sushi so he might want to check on that. Thought we were being nice by warning him that but instead the took it the wrong way. He was really really rude!!! I should've vomitt at the table, instead of trying to hold it until I get to the bathroom.PLEASE BECAREFUL WHEN YOU EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He questioned my order and when I repeated myself he said I GOT IT!!! I specifically requested the salad be brought out with the sushi NOT as an appetizer because I had ordered soup.  Of course minutes after order out came this ""salad"", now I know that most japaense places have shit iceburg lettuce but at least the dressing usually makes up for this.  This salad was so disgusting looking, I actually tried to turn it away, but the waiter refused.  When I said I wanted the salad to come out later, he took it away and placed it feet away from me.  LOL it was actually kinda hilarious because it was so bad.  The food was decent, sushi not the best quality and I would be interested in the hibachi but this man was so horrible I can't give this place more than one star.  If I thought it would make a difference, I would have said something to his manager but I got the vibe it didnt matter what this guy did.  WILL NOT RETURN OUT OF PRINCIPLE!",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Immediately after being seated the owner advised he was going to seat seven additional people, that would never feasibly fit, at our table. The waiter opened half of the parties wine and took 25 minutes to bring glasses. After waiting an hour to be seated, it was almost another hour before our orders arrived. Overall the staff is rude and the management is ruder. With the endless food options available in Hoboken, choosing Ayame is foolish.  You're presence is a burden to the staff and management and nothing else.

It was painfully obvious that it was not made for my order.   i'm hoping that it was an anomaly, but  it will be tough to try it again at $50+.  i think the moral here is that hoboken can not sustain a good sushi place.  food is 2 stars, but when coupled with the co$t, it's a 1 star joint.",Ayame Hibachi & Sushi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
