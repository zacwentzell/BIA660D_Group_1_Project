1,NNeCi0L0OLfQ-gRRbDVUQw,Alexis N.,1.0 star rating,"I am so disappointed in this restaurant . I walked in to have dinner on a Friday night, and they told me there was a wait and they would call me if the bar opened up , but if not , to come back in an hour for a table . I called before I went back to see if there was a table, and they told me yes , come back . I got back to the restaurant and had three other couples sit before my friend and  I . I explained I had been waiting for a while and the host was extremely rude to me and told me to ""have a nice night , darling."" I then tried to speak with the owner who also told me to have a nice night . I have never been more disrespected by a restaurant in my life . As a Hoboken local , you can be sure I will be sharing this experience with all my local neighbors and friends . Terribly disappointed in Barbes .",Barbès Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Moroccan"

3,Oq71uElOT0zaJurlrfWl0A,Linda K.,5.0 star rating,"Amazing place and a much needed addition to the taverns and pizzas restaurant scene of Hoboken. Everything about the night was great!  They welcomed kids at 6:30 seating. My kids are bit older and well behaved but still nice they welcome family. The wine was delicious, a Moroccan one outside of Casablanca, a well-balanced and easy to drink cab blend. We had the steak, the duck and lamb tagine, all were delicious, generous portions, cooked exact to our order and flavorful. The lamb tagine with dates and onions were delish. Duck had a perfectly crisped skin but with Moroccan spices. Event the green beans that accompanied the main dish was great, according to my husband and he's not a fan of veggies. Dessert traditional Moroccan style was a light pastry with rose water. Light and good. A great addition to Hoboken. Will be back soon for sure!",Barbès Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Moroccan"
4,CCBC7aFB4RDZIkRq2lGs6w,Eli M.,5.0 star rating,My wife and I live nearby and have been anticipating what this space would be as we saw it being renovated.  We were hoping for a restaurant and were thrilled to hear that it was.  We ate here recently for the first time and all of our anticipation was met with an incredibly delicious meal and very warm service from the whole staff.  It is a best case scenario for what moved into the once-empty space.  We will be back many times!,Barbès Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Moroccan"
5,umW5gC3yFVFdPJG6H0k8Jg,Jane R.,5.0 star rating,"Went to Barbès in its first week or two of being open in Hoboken and was very impressed all around. The food was delicious and authentic, the drinks were great, the service was friendly and quick. There isn't really any other place serving similar cuisine in Hoboken, so hopefully they have found a niche and will stick around. Will definitely be going back!",Barbès Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Moroccan"

Drinks were good along with friendly and quick service.  Hopefully, they step up their game in the kitchen and hire a professional designer.",Barbès Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"French,, Moroccan"
