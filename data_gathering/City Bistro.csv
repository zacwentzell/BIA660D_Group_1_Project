1,_dncee53et_-1IId0xK2Mw,Kristin M.,3.0 star rating,"City Bistro you are just okay in my book, its not that the food was horrible but it wasn't anything memorable. Price wise -especially when you look at the price tag, I was just disappointed. For a night out on the town with the girls, I ordered two appetizers as my meal - the chicken meatballs and the garlic shrimp. The miss on the food definitely comes from the shrimp which were overcooked unfortunately while the chicken meatballs were decent. Overall I would recommend saving you money in this place to grab a drink or to stop by for its' rooftop in the summer. Atmosphere wise this place is intimate for a cute date night or if you are grabbing a drink with friends.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

All the entrees sounded delicious that it literally made it so difficult to narrow it down!! Their red wine suggestion was fabulous after a long day in and out of the cold. Best chopped wedge salad I've ever had in my life. Best salad I've ever tasted! Lots of yummy surprises in that tasty salad!! I will come back for that alone!! I was going to get the Gilled skirt steak because that my favorite way for it to be prepared or the salmon and the sides sounded Devine!! Cauliflower rice and parmagian Brussels!! But I haven't eaten pasta in like 19 years so I went with Italian! Spaghetti. BUT not your average spaghetti!! The Meatballs!! Omg, melt in your mouth delicious!! You will fall out of your chair! Fresh basil, wonderful flavor!! I loved everything about this place, the food and the people! My server was new and she has not tried any the food but super sweet and obviously you can't go wrong with anything in this menu! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked tackle worthy! But I restrained myself! I also had dessert and coffee! I know I know but I had too!! I would have put a picture but I devoured it too soon!!!   Awesome vibe!

This is one of the few rooftop bars in Hoboken, so I had high hopes and wanted to love it, but I was sadly underwhelmed. The food is okay - good but nothing special. Our favorite appetizer was the Firecracker Shrimp. The White Pizza was definitely not my favorite - I've had much better elsewhere. The main issue was that the service was not good. Our waitress was chatting with her co-workers half the time, and we had to go up to her several times to refill our drinks and eventually give us our check.

Because it was labor day the rooftop had a crazy wait, but they also had outdoor seating on the street level which was great for enjoying the weather. We went up to the rooftop briefly and it was a pretty average rooftop. Monday is by far the best day in terms of week day special (half price food & drinks). We split the fish tacos ($14 full price), short rib grilled cheese ($15), and carbonara ($19). The fish tacos were full of favor but they skimped on the fish. You get 3 tacos per order so it was fine as an appetizer but would not recommend as an entree. The short rib grilled cheese was amazing - exactly what you'd imagine with tender short rib in a grill cheese + arugula. The carbonara was pretty average - a little oily for our taste. A lot of people around us ordered the hot chicken wings + pizza so we will be back to try!

Third floor is the rooftop which is what I came here for but unfortunately wasn't able to enjoy it much. I got there at 7pm and it was packed! Throughout the night it got even worst, you had to make a line to get up there so I can only imagine it got worst. I stayed in the lounge area which was cool. Our bartender, Tara, was amazing! Best Moscow mule I ever had !!! She did great being I felt they were understaffed. Management needs to chill out, they're super rude to their staff and should learn how to talk to people.

44,sTwvPXOtsPD48t-wN4L-7g,Natalia C.,3.0 star rating,"I enjoyed coming here all winter. The food is good and the half price Mondays are great a value. I was excited to start coming more often in the Spring/Summer when the roof opened but such a disappointment! The drinks are the same price but come in plastic cups half the size. I am usually willing to pay the slight upcharge for a good cocktail when they come in proper glasses but not when they come in the SMALL plastic solo cups. I get there are rules against glass cups on the roof but at least serve regular sized cups or offer a discounted price. I was appalled. I got the vibe I was getting shamelessly ripped off on food/drinks just because I was on the roof. Too bad the view is now completely obstructed by a new apartment building so you're just as good sitting out on the sidewalk anywhere else.Other cons:Food isn't spectacular, only worth it on weekday deals like half off monday. If it was a little cheaper I'd probably give it 4 stars for better value.For example I once had a pricey sandwich here and the bread was stale.Pros:GREAT STAFF - can't say enough about friendly wait staff and bartenders.Decent locationOne of two rooftops in hoboken (obstructed view)good crowd",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

This was our first time experiencing the food and the food is excellent and the roof top is dope (only reason I didn't give 1 star based on our experience). The service is absolutely BRUTAL. Like awful-brutal. Granted we went on a Monday where you have half off specials, I get it, it's going to be slow... However, this was inexcusable. We had a 5th person join us who sat for over a half hour without anyone even asking a drink order. The place isn't that big, the waitress should be able to check on her table more often. If the waitress was more tentative we would of had a much larger drink and food bill before going to the roof deck. We were constantly just looking for our waitress and she wasn't even in our sight lines 90% of the time. She went M.I.A so often we asked the hostess, a bus boy, and even the bar tender at points to help us out. I'm not going to sit here and rip the place apart because I think it's a great roof top bar and again the food is good. The service just sucks for dinning. It sucks really bad on the main floor. We realized this sucky service was probably due to the fact that the waitress was going to get 20% of the original amount anyway. Yes the gratuity was included at 20% on the original amount. Which granted, is totally FAIR and appropriate and what we would of tipped (for good service). However, the approach is incredibly shady. They should show you the original amount because if you do the math with what is presented to you, it looks like almost 50% of the bill is added on top for ""included gratuity."" They don't communicate it and its SHADY stuff. The couple we were with was going to tip on top of that, which I'm sure they'd love, but that's poor poor business model and it seems scammy and scummy. You should communicate the tipping policy or at least make the receipts more clear on this. I also think management needs to remind the employees that they still need to DO THEIR JOB as a waitress regardless of the included gratuity they are getting. We enjoyed ourselves towards the end of the night because Adam on the roof bar was a riot and the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star. I do want to give the place another shot in the future... I just have to muster up the conversation with my husband to see if he'd go back. Half price is awesome but that slow and totally delirious of a server is still not worth any promo deal. City Bistro, I wish you did better.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

This is understandable to ensure your waiter gets a reasonable tip. HOWEVER, signature cocktails are not included in the half off deal (this oversight wasn't the issue). The cocktails were charged full price WITH THE FULL 40% gratuity applied to it, which is absurd and adds up very quickly. Even after discussion with the staff, I felt tricked and a bit betrayed and nothing was done. I understand the intent of the gratuity adjustment, but they should consider putting a different system in place to remind the customer to tip appropriately without ripping anyone off in the process.

I am trying to get comfortable with the area so finding a local spot to have a few drinks, relax and enjoy the area. My intention was to check it out and have one drink then call it a day. The vibe was friendly and the establishment is well maintained and I like the options of outside seating. Their was a decent crowd for a Wednesday night and I was able to get a seat at the bar. The staff was very polite and were very informative when I started asking questions about what they had to offer. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I am looking foward to trying them out. The shinning star of the night without a doubt was their bar tender Tara. Her big smile and outgoing personality made my first Jersey night life experience one to remember. When she found out I was new to the area, she took it upon herself without hesitation to fill me in on the ""Do's"" and ""Dont's"" of jersey and some of her experiences. She balanced her  time between the other customers proficently and I did not hear any customers have to ask her for a refill she was always one step ahead ,asking them if they needed a refill along with a big smile. Mind you one drink turned  into many because of the friendly atmosphere that the management team has created made the stress of being new to the area fade even if it was just for one night. Being that she is one of the newest staff members and  my pleasurable experience, I am looking foward to meeting the rest of the staff of city bistro.

To my surprise, every Monday City Bistro has half price drinks. We had a few cocktails and I paid our check by credit card. The next day I looked at my receipt as I as about to throw it out and saw that the original check amount was $22.50 and there was a gratuity added of $9 (nearly 50% of my check). I called City Bistro to inquire about this and was told it is their policy on Mondays to charge an automatic gratuity of 20% on whatever the full value of the drinks would have been. I was never informed of this policy when I ordered my drinks, when my check was delivered, and when I went to sign my check, the itemized receipt was completely covered and placed on the bottom where the gratuity charge was not circled or highlighted in any way.I asked to speak with a manager and none was available and the owner couldn't be located. The woman I spoke to was very polite and apologized. She explained that the bartenders are supposed to inform customers of this policy which obviously does not always occur (probably because most people don't check their receipts and the bartenders are happy to get tipped twice). To add insult to injury, the bartenders working on Monday acted like it was a chore to serve the customers, looked bored, ignored people standing at the bar, and gave an attitude when you asked politely for another drink.

We have been a a bunch of times and we are giving it a bit of a break after our last trek.Now, service is usually pretty good. Sometimes it has been so-so. Last time we sat outside and were basically forgotten. No water refills, no check in, food took absolutely forever and the order was slightly wrong. It took around an hour and a half to eat. So that wasn't great.The grilled cheese with short rib is great and a pretty tasty sandwich. The burger is average, good and definitely an option but definitely not the best burger in the world. The open face steak ""sandwich"" is pretty pitiful. It is a few pieces of probably hanger steak on a tiny piece of baguette. I think open faced I still think 2 pieces of bread and a big hunk of meat, onions and cheese negating the ability to pick it up and eat. For what it costs I would avoid this all together. Last time I ordered it it was missing the onions. The fries are basic McDonald's style fries. Mondays are half off the entire menu (most alcohol included too) which is always a good option. They do add tip which I think is a good idea because people won't tip on the pre-discounted amount.At night it's a weird crowd and an eclectic mix of people. There is an upstairs bar and a line to get to the rooftop. The rooftop is surrounded by buildings, not like it's amazing, it just happens to be outside. As a general rule of thumb I don't wait in lines in Hoboken (or really any place really), it's silly. There are plenty of places without lines. Sometimes there is a line out of the front door.

Their menu didn't have a variety of dishes to choose from.The first time I came here was for lunch during late summer. My boyfriend and I ate on the rooftop; it was a nice deck-like setting. When you walk to the top, they have a medium-sized eat area and a bar on the other side (nicely separated from the eating area). They have TVs on the rooftop as well, but it's hard to see when there's a lot of glare. The lunch menu was ok, not a lot to choose from. I tried their popular grilled cheese steak sandwich which wasn't that amazing to me. I don't remember what my boyfriend got, but he wasn't too thrilled with it as well.The second time we came here was for brunch. I think their rooftop closes after summer, so we were seated on the second floor (I believe the rooftop is on the third floor). The seating area was quite dark and dreary, not a lot of sun coming through the window. I tried their popular crunchy french toast; 2 slices of bread somehow battered or mixed with cereal flakes, blueberries, bananas, strawberries and a side of maple syrup. The concept and dish was good, but nothing amazing. I don't remember what my boyfriend got, but again, he said it was just ok.I'm giving City Bistro three stars because of the following: street parking is hard to find.

The ambiance is nice and relaxing and the crowd is prime Hoboken (young professionals with some older folks sprinkled in). The lighting is low, which is fine as it helps set a more intimate mood. They do have an upstairs (and a rooftop!) but both were not an option when we arrived (upstairs was a ghost town, way too cold for the roof).Bathroom: I did not use it during the visit.Staff: Our waiter was very nice and willing to bend over backwards for us. He double checked with the bar when he couldn't remember the bourbons they had and he was constantly keeping an eye on us to see if we needed anything.Food/Drink: We started with a couple of bourbons and then had a couple more (well, there was an old fashioned mixed in there but it was VERY sweet). For food we started with the pretzel bites (tasty) and then had the Grilled Salmon (very tasty) and the Pork Chops (a bit fatty, and on the bone, but enjoyable).Value: Like I said, this is a more upscale place so you can imagine the prices to be a bit higher. However, they are not terrible. In fact, they are right in line with other, similar, upscale restaurants in Hoboken. The food is good, the surroundings are nice, and the service is great; you get your money's worth here.I'm glad we gave this place a try because I will certainly remember it next time we are looking for a dinner spot - it's so close to home that it will easily always be in the running.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Would I jump to come back, probably not but wouldnt say no if someone else asked to go here. I ordered the egg platter which was actually quite yummy. The bacon had the percise amount of crispyness, the hashbrowns were delicious and full of flavor, and the scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. My sister ordered the buttermilk pancakes with strawberries and bananas.  Those were the thinnest pancakes I have ever seen.  To me, they were just okay something I would never order, I mean aren't pancakes supposed to be fluffy? My mother order the bistro burger that apparently was excellent. It was so good that she was still raving about it in our most recent food adventure.Our service was just okay which is the reason I wouldn't give this place more than a 3. I guess getting older I really do appreciate some great service. You take care of me, I take care of you.  Its the little things that count for me.

The owner who happened to past by asked how we liked the place and we told him what happened and he was great! He cancelled our bill and asked us to order something else and he apologized profusely because they also forgot we were sitting at the place and no one ever asked if we needed something we didn't even had plates but becaus of the owner who asked us to give them a chance and go come back we did today!!!!! Oh man! What a mistake!!!!! This is how is going... we order RED sangria and got white one! We said we order red and they took the white and it was obvious they added a liltle red wine to make it look red and it taste like dirty water. we told the waitress to change it and they took forever to bring our drinks. We again order the traditional pizza with pepperoni and chicken wings! The pizza came an hour later burneddddd and without peperonni we again told the waitress and she said she will order a new one and apologized. She left the  burned pizza in our table for like ten minutes so we just moved it to an empty table next to us and the she just came and picked it up and gave to another couple sitting outside as we looked at her walking to them.

There is ample space indoors + rooftop + patio, which are all pluses, especially in Hoboken. The first time I came for brunch, I was with 2 other ladies and we had a really good time. The food was alright (Huevos Rancheros) and the drinks were a little better. During my most recent experience, I was with a group of 8 and while the owners and waitress were very accommodating we ended up having a slightly different experience than we planned. We chose to come here over Brass Rail for brunch because unfortunately there aren't too many other options for an unlimited-esque setting in Hoboken. We had a round of solid drinks at the bar downstairs while we waited for our whole group to arrive... good start. Since we were rather large, we were seated upstairs where it was still quiet and more spacious... still going strong. The waitress took some time to find us I think, so when she was ready we all ordered 2 drinks so as to keep the momentum going. This is when things started to go downhill. Lets just say there were ZERO bubbles in my glass and we felt ripped off to say the least. The group immediately decided to just buy bottles of champagne ($33 a pop) to keep the flow going instead of giving the bartenders a hard time. To eat, there was a breakfast pizza (full size pie and probably the most worth-while thing on the menu), classic & crabcake eggs benedicts, omlettes, steak and eggs, and french toast. I had the crabcake benedict, which was mediocre. The crabcakes were super small and the hollandaise was kind of bland. After polishing off the champagne, the bill came out to a little less than $40 a person, which everyone was pretty content with. Had the mimosa situation gone a little smoother, I think everyone would have left a bit happier.The bar scene is definitely more fun so I'll be back here for a night out.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Then their food quality is disgusting and I do come from a line of hospitality so I know what I'm talking about. Their firecracker shrimp is grocery store style fried shrimp from a bag of shrimp in the freezer with a little bit of hot sauce on it. And no not that good kind of hot sauce that we all tend to love. I didn't even ask to take anything off the bill but when the waitress came by I just asked for the balance and that I actually prefer to leave because buyer beware at the end of the day so I'll take it as a loss. She made it a point to tell the owner which means at least they have good service and the owner came by and I didn't want to be ""that guy"" so I told him I am just not pleased with the food and drinks and I told her I just wanted the check  and he told me that I should leave and was an asshole overall.

Both were excellent and of decent portion. For our meals we ordered Chopped Salad, Homefries, Scrambled Eggs, and French Toast. The French Toast was coated in cornflakes and topped with blue berries. The eggs were fluffy and the salad was large and tasty. The Homefries were large potato slices with burnt onions and peppers. Very good, but I would prefer smaller potato slices. The Bloody Mary was unfortunately nothing special. Tastes like your generic mix with some added horseradish sauce. An all natural, high quality, tall glass Bloody Mary drink would do good here.

I was here last night (really hoping to see Jeff) but Ashleigh was bartending. No problem! My date and I sat down and she greeted us with such a warm smile. You know you are at the right bar when the bartender gives you a warm welcome as should all bartenders. I had already known Turley was going to be on the wine list but checked the menu just for reassurance that my favorite red zinfandel would be on there! It was, so immediately asked for it. She opened it and poured me a taste, was a bit warm so I asked her to chill it for a little and she did so. Then the apps come out. My date and I had the hummus and the braised short rib nachos. GET THE NACHOS! EVERY chip has something on it! Not a huge dish. the chips are big but they literally put toppings on each chip. Perfect size app! We didn't even have to ask her for more pita for the hummus. She brought it out as soon as 1 pita was left. So attentive. She even timed the chilling right on my wine. Brought it out, gave me another taste and I nodded that it was perfect temperature. My date got the BBQ burger for his entree and I got the pork chops (my usual). My dates burger was phenomenal and my pork chops were definitely just a little over medium but I ate them anyways (I didn't tell Ashleigh this, so she had no idea). It was perfectly fine. We took our time and not once did we feel rushed! She would talk to us here and there but wouldn't over due it so that my date and I could talk to each other.

He then proceeded to say that it was not raw and he didn't know what could be wrong with it. It was clearly raw as my girlfriend is now sick. The service is also extremely slow/unattentive.

My ONLY small complaint is there is only 1 bathroom for the men and women to share.  If the place gets busy and drinks keep flowing, the line for the bathroom can take longer then wanted.  Definitely check it out--also, they don't take reservations for parties less then 8 people.  My friends and I have never had a  problem getting a table, and if need be--you can always sit at the bar.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Great in warm weather with happy hour specials that are really good for uptown that go beyond 7pm! Their food is good, but not amazing. I really enjoy their basics, such as their chicken sandwich, salads or pizza. Their sangria is fantastic and they have a whole night devoted to half priced pitchers! A must try! The unlimited drinks at brunch seem watered down. Bistro has a good crowd and you can take anyone there; from your parents for a nice lunch or dinner to your college buddies for an all night party on a weekend.

Next time I'll probably go for one of the other house cocktails. For dinner, I decided on the veggie burger with a side salad. It was a very middle of the road veggie burger. Better than most but not nearly one of the best. It was pretty flat and mushy. The salad was alright, but was pretty much just mixed greens with some sort of oil dressing. My friends split a pizza which was fairly flat but very cheesy. Not the typical east coast pizza, but not horrible. I was kind of underwhelmed.

Our first stop was City Bistro. There was no cover to get in, which was a plus. Inside, there is an open area, presumably a dance floor; unfortunately, not too many people were dancing. This was a shame, since the music was pretty awesome.. good mix of reggae, rap and techno. Similarly, the crowd was pretty mixed. A few glammed up girls, a lot of couples, and just people in general having a good time. The place wasn't overly packed, which might have been because the weather that evening was kinda rainy.It was pretty easy to get to the bar. Beers were expensive, but I guess most places in the area are similarly priced; I paid $6 each for a Stella and a Yuengling.I know they have a rooftop area but it was closed off, again most likely due to the weather, although the rain had stopped by the time we got there. There was another smaller bar area upstairs - however, the room was PACKED with people, leading to a really cramped stale and hot feeling. We didn't stick around this smaller area and instead went back downstairs.I give this place a 3.5 (bumped up to a 4 because the overall feel of the place is great).

Besides the freak thunderstorm and my roommates buddy almost getting into a fight with a woman there, I would say the experience was good.My roommate and I stopped there in the evening to get some drinks and appetizers. Our first table was located out front where they have a small outdoor seating section. That area was nice until it started down pouring and we realized that the awning covering that section was not water proof. The staff did very well with handling the chaos and got everyone inside and seated within a couple of minutes. Their level of service and friendliness was excellent for the entire night. Once settled inside we ordered drinks and food which was half off during happy hour.   Happy hour runs from 4-8pm on Wednesdays and you can order half price beers and mixed drinks. They also had half price appetizers and pitchers of Sangria on Wednesday from 4pm till close, which is what we took full advantage of. I ordered the wings, which were pretty good and came with ranch dressing and celery sticks. You can get them either mild, hot or suicide if you dare. And the pitchers on Sangria were perfect for cooling down after having the wings.After dinner we headed up to the rooftop bar which was pretty nice. It had a semi view of the NYC skyline, a decent view of the rest of Hoboken, and TVs all around it. There was a fair amount of people up there for a Wednesday, which I was surprised by. The rooftop was a good size and had plenty of seating. They allowed us to bring our pitcher of Sangria up and we finished that before leaving.Overall I gave the City Bistro a four star because of the great staff, the different choices of seating, the food, and the great happy hour and daily specials. A normal person would probably have given this a five star rating, but as you know if you read my other reviews I am a tough critic.

Hey loser, you should be wondering why you don't have ANY business at lunch instead. I felt like I was in a mortuary it was so dead.  Not 1 customer. Perhaps you should reconsider your menu prices for your items. I'm in the restaurant business as well but in Manhattan. I can tell you 2 teeny tiny pieces of chicken on my salad for $5 is beyond ridiculous. There are five star restaurant out there that charge less than that for more.  And the garlic on your Cesar salad, try using an actual garlic instead of a jar of minced garlic. Fresh garlic really stands out more. Your appetizers were ridiculously small for the price. Only way I would come back and reconsider this place or recommend to friends living in the area would be first the owner should change his attitude towards employees. Or try to be more discreet about your issues instead of making a scene by the door. I noticed no matter how quiet you were. Your mug said it all.  Then I would focus on losing ""manhattan"" prices for a NEW JERSEY restaurant . Get real please. You can get a better wine list as well.

Hopefully it will make it's way back, because the management really works hard for the customers.Keep it in your rotation though, it is a solid place overall.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

We go to the roof, the barback gave us a menu. No server for several minutes. We went downstairs to inquire, the hostess says you have to order from the bar. Maybe she could have shared that with us before. We ask to sit downstairs and no sever comes by for 10 minutes. I try to flag down a server. Finally I ask hostess to send someone over, several minutes later an uninterested guy (don't want to refer to him as a server because servers actually care about their job) comes over and half heartedly takes our order.

There was no shade form the unrelenting sun so we headed back inside. The service was so-so as we couldn't even distinguish who was actually our waitress and we waited about 10 minutes to re-order drinks. (We were seated right by the hostess/wait station).

We were seated at a hightop which I liked but it was so dark. We were putting on our cell phone flashlights to clearly read the menu. That was really too much. Our waiter was pretty good and was very patient with us as we were pretty indecisive regarding our order. I had the tuna taquitos which were very good. There were 3 mini tacos stuffed with sushi grade tuna, avocado and an aioli. For my meal, I had a calamari salad. The salad had fried calamari on the bottom, drenched with a sweet ginger dressing on the bottom and undressed frisee on top. I wish the frisee were dressed. It was a little difficult to get down and it was also chopped slightly large for my liking. My dining companions really liked their lobster mac n cheese as well as old world pizza. I did not try these, but a statement was made about the pizza that went something like ""I think this pizza is better than Grimaldis."" That is a pretty great compliment around these parts. Our other dining companion had the salmon which he seemed to like, I noticed that the portion was kind of small. There were some excellent choices for beer on tap, but I felt like my beer should have been a colder, or maybe served in a frosted glass. It got warm very quickly and I stopped drinking.  As we were leaving, the hostess ignored us and was just busy talking to her friend. No ""thank you"", no ""have a good night"".

He came over as soon as we sat down and when we told him we needed another minute he mumbled something about 'ok but you better decide quick because the kitchen is backed up.' The restaurant was full, but its sunday brunch in hoboken...what do you expect? Anyways he returned a couple of times and ignored our requests for another mimosa SEVERAL TIMES. I did notice that he paid a lot of attention to a group of young women in the back who were typical Hoboken girls  (you know, heels, full make up and curled hair for morning brunch) and a group from Good Day New York in the back. I was really pissed and thought he was awful. I told my boyfriend I wouldn't say his name though, but management either needs to train their wait staff better or hire more waiters (I won't overlook the possibility that he was overworked).Anyways as for the rest of it....it seems like everyone else in there was related to/knew the owner. I guess that's how they get business because it certainly wasn't the service. The food was ok - I got huevos rancheros. My boyfriend had a problem with his order. He ordered the pancakes which the menu said came with strawberries...when he got them they were covered in blueberries, to which he has a severe allergy!!! I'm not sure why the kitchen thought it would be ok to sub something out without checking with the customer first....anyways we had to wait ten minutes for them to re-make his pancakes (while my eggs got cold) and when they came out they looked really plain and tasted kind of dry.Typical Hoboken d-bag scene.

247,ti075z6QFHyKQmT-M7MP0w,D C.,3.0 star rating,"NOTE: This review is for the restaurant and not the barCame here twice since my last review.  The problem with this place is that it is very inconsistent. Each time I had a different experience - either really good, decent but could use improvement, or pretty bad. This isn't only limited to the times I have been there.  From what I hear from other people this is the general theme.I tried them for their early dinner recently and the food and service were surprisingly top notch! (This would have netted them a 5 star rating if not for my so so experience the time after...which I will get into shortly).  Now one would think dining early at a restaurant would lead to lower quality food and rushed service.  That was not the case at all.  Our server was prompt but we never felt rushed at all.  They were quick to refill our drinks and we never went through the meal thirsty.  I started our meal with minestrone soup which was filled with a nice sampling of vegetables and served in a large bowl.  Definitely bigger than what I was expecting.  A little salty but I was quite satisfied...the soup alone almost filled me up.  Bread served with it was hit or miss.  The olive bread was really good but some of the other choices were just plain stale.  I noticed the table next to us got some cinnamon raisin rolls which we requested.  Those were amazing!  So good and freshly out of the oven.  Why don't they just serve these?? Hmm....  For the main course I got the Alaskan Salmon which was cooked perfectly and served with sweet potato mash.  The mash was not overly buttery like I expected and was a nice twist on the typical mashed potatoes side.  For dessert I ordered the chocolate lava cake which was served warm with vanilla ice cream.  The dessert was decadent and delicious! I have gotten lava cakes that tasted like they were nuked at other establishments and I didn't feel that way here.  Overall I was highly impressed with my dining experience.The next time I went was a different story.  Bread served with the meal was very stale, the place was freezing, the service was slow, and the food portions were extremely cut down.  This time again I got the Salmon but part of the regular menu.  After such a wonderful experience last time I was expecting a knockout meal.  It was a disappointment.  It wasn't cooked as well and was about half the size that it was last time. My friend's sandwich was also much smaller than expected and what was missing in the sandwich was replaced with a ton of fries.On a busy time like a Friday night, you would think they would be more on their game than they were during the week.  I was surprised it wasn't the case. You wold think they would have a working heating system in the middle of the winter. They tried to fix it after a few people made comments (including my table) but to no avail.  I felt like an eskimo donning my coat, scarf, and hat but it was the only way to keep warm.While it may seem like going here is a true gamble with what you will end up with, overall it still is a good place to grab a nice bite at a reasonable price.  Just keep in mind you might come on the ""wrong night in the kitchen"".  For me, I will definitely give it another try and hope the last time was just a fluke.BTW during the summer they have a fun rooftop bar and overall their drinks are really good.  They seem to be more consistent in that area.  Also the menu on their website is from 1-2 menus ago and it hasn't been updated in months.  Might need to go in person to get a better idea of what they currently offer.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

261,ezkv7g0VofSxbORqiIxLiQ,Patrick F.,5.0 star rating,"The skirt steak with onion rings and asparagus was definitely the best meal I've had in Hoboken so far. Of course, those are three of my favorite menu items anywhere - and to get them on one plate was a little serendipitous for me. The steak was tender and well-marinated and the asparagus wasn't slathered in butter or oil like most places seem to think is appropriate. The onion rings were crispy and flavorful without tasting greasy.Other pluses: - Our service was attentive in that ""we're here but not in your face"" way.- They weren't playing that trendy dance music that's so popular at nicer places these days.- The patio was very pleasant - 14th street is pretty low traffic, so it's not like you're sitting in an exhaust pipe.- Molten lava cake = yum!",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Last night my friend and I decided to head to CB since we both had never been. We decided to sit outside and enjoy the nice, warm evening. We were greeted by an excellent waiter. Our drinks came quickly. We split an order of the Calamari (fried with sliced hot peppers and 3 different types of dipping sauces). Delicious! Not the best I ever had but definitely up there. My guest decided to go with a salad (the Gina) and I went with the pork chop. We both enjoyed our meals very much! The sauce on top of the pc was similar to one of the spicy dipping sauces. It was a large piece of pc which I couldn't finish. Recap: Service was great. Food was very good. Highly recommend for a nice date. The roof top bar (which we went to for a few minutes) is nice. Good view of NYC on one side. Smaller area but the middle floor is nice as well (indoors).",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

The roof seems like it would be cool but its more lame than anything else. My other problem is that this whole place seems to have an attitude like they think they are better than everyone else.

272,cxfPstk0aDvAPt1tInzVkg,Natalie M.,1.0 star rating,"I stumbled upon city bistro for the first time about a month ago and had a great experience on a Thursday night. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and my boyfriend could not stop raving about the tuna tartar. We enjoyed it so much that we actually returned the following Thursday and had another great experience. And then...there was Monday. Complete opposite experience. Our waiter was one of the worst I've had. Completely careless and didn't even check to make sure our food was okay. When I asked him for a second drink, he ""misheard"" me and asked me if I wanted the check. As someone who's been waitressing since the age of 16, my service requirements are a lot more forgiving than those of the general public, but this guy was a joke. Everything began to make sense when I received my check with an automatic 20% gratuity added to the total before the half price discount. Again, as a waitress I am no stranger to the unfairness of a bad tip. But in this case, being forced to give 20% to someone who barely deserved 10% annoyed me to no end. This guy got to do literally nothing to ensure I had a good experience and still go home with all 20% tips. Talk about the best job ever. I will definitely never return to city bistro on a Monday ever again to get service I can get at a diner for a third of the price.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
273,Aa7zyWyIOZLqXaWg7AYKQA,Bryan W.,1.0 star rating,"This dump is the worst! I had walked by several times and thought it looked like a really quaint french bistro; perfect for date night. The first time I went to City Bistro was on New Year's Eve (admittedly probably not the time to experience a restaurant at it's best). When I made my reservation they were adamant that we be on time - if we were late, they'd hold the table up to 15 minutes, which sounded reasonable given that it was a busy night. When we arrived (on time) we were greeted outside the front door by a bouncer (WTF?) who made us wait outside in freezing and slightly snowy conditions while he confirmed with the hostess that we were on the reservation list. When we got inside I was horrified to find that the quaint little bistro I was so excited to try had turned into a Jersey Shore-esque, fist pumping nightmare. We were told that it would be roughly 30 minutes until our table was ready (I guess the 15 minute reservation rule didn't count when they were running behind!). After over 45 minutes of waiting in the extremely crowded and loud bar area we walked out. I ended up walking home and eating mac & cheese because we had wasted so much time waiting for our table. Regrettably, I decided to give City Bistro another chance when I had a friend in town on a Saturday night. On the positive side, we were able to get a table upstairs with no waiting and our waiter was friendly and provided decent service. The food was decent, although over priced for what the place really is. On the down side, I just don't get this place. On the outside it tries to pass itself off like an upscale bistro. On the inside it blasts booty music and turns into a club (kinda like the Peach Pit After Dark on vintage 90210). Surprisingly, the upstairs dining room is decorated as you'd expect for a bistro, but is accented by tacky fake flowers and loud music (the same booty music they blast downstairs). I can without a doubt say that I'd never go back to City Bistro.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

I  usually frequent this establishment on a MONDAY because they have an all-day 1/2 off everything menu.  Normally their prices are higher than what I would like to pay for a bar in Hoboken but on Monday expect to be able to try pretty much anything for half off.  Their food is pretty good, not amazing, with a nice variety including pizzas, salads, sandwiches, and great appetizers.  The bartenders are friendly and they have a very nice wine selection.",City Bistro,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

An order of golden, medium buffalo wings (really fantastic-came with a fresh gorgonzola dip), a salmon club (almost perfectly executed - a tasty aioli dressing, pickles, a nice crispy and tender piece of salmon on good hearty white toast....but.... no bacon.

The waitress took about 15 minutes to come over for our drink orders- it was a very hot day, so all you are looking for is a cold drink as soon as you sit down! After we finally ordered, the drinks came first (on a long delay because the machine wasn't working, not sure what machine that would be) and my bloody mary was VERY WARM! I sent it back and asked for a cold version! Then the meal came and was not very good. I had salmon benedict. The english muffin was burnt on the top and not even toasted. (how hard is that) The salmon was un eatable and slimy. I ended up just pushing it to the side. The eggs were even cold by the time i received them. We then overheard the waitress telling another party that just sat down that things would be on a delay bc a large party just came in inside- how is that a priority over any other table!?!?!?! Do you not staff your restaurant accordingly?!!?! That was unbelievable to me- how could you tell your customers that.
