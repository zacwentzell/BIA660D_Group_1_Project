I usually do take-out but have dined in as well.  The take-out is thoughtfully packaged!...thoughtfully packaged? What, as in a warm note packed along or curled ribbon around your cutlery?  Ha! Nope! They take careful consideration in placing your food in not only in a brown paper bag but they place that bag in a clear plastic bag so as to contain any spillage from sauces nor gravies.  Yea, yea, and every take-out, places their containers in plastic shopping bags. This is merely added assurance;)Ok the food! My favorites begging with the roasted pork that so tasty and the cuero (pork rind) is always so perfect!  The guineo(small boiled bananas) and yuca (boiled cassava) are the best seasoned I've ever had:) the Saldana is yuuuummm!  Empanadas?!
