Highly recommended. Definitely a little gem of a hole in the wall in the area. Prices are very reasonable as well.",Aldys Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican
1,ZZELut-m0rSyivf8saCMKA,Mark S.,4.0 star rating,"Very nondescript kind of place... Strictly a Yelp search cause I had a hankering for Mexican food. Went with the 3 taco special for $7.00. One each of chicken, beef and pork served up with what the owner said was a mild sauce. Could only wonder what the hot sauce would have been like, as this opened up my sinuses.Menu is strictly a blackboard. Aldys has only 3 tables plus a couple of stools by the front counter and that's it. Gotta admit that the food was pretty darn good. Definitely not the easiest place to find. Probably walked by this place 2 or 3 times before I realized where it was. No sign is out front, just the address.This is not a chain. Nice little hole in a wall establishment in Union City. Would like to explore the menu a little bit further. As these places are somewhat popular in the vicinity.",Aldys Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican

We've tried pretty much everything on the menu (Mexican eats) and the biztec torta (steak sandwich) is our favorite!",Aldys Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican

Got no more than 3 tables in it but the food is Bomb!!! I recommend the ""Torta de Res"" this hole in the wall spot is authentic as it gets for Mexican food in union city. Everything is A1",Aldys Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican
