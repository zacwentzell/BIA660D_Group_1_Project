0,tt1vLgAP5UpRXAKJLT2KWg,Alec K.,5.0 star rating,"Absolutely amazing ramen and poké. The price is high but you certainly get what you pay for. IMHO they have the best ramen and poké in all of Hoboken. Their serving size is probably the greatest of all Hoboken restaurants as well. Ramen-wise, this is the best ramen I've had in my life. Granted, I haven't eaten much ramen before this, and every time I've had it before I've not really enjoyed it. Suddenly I come to South Street and I absolutely cant stop until I'm at the bottom of the massive bowl. Their selection is large enough to come here every day for a week and still not have tried all the ramens.As far as their poké: fantastic. Immensely generous in their serving size and ingredient selection (just handing out avocado as if it were an inexpensive ingredient), the flavor and quality are top notch. Their suggested combinations are fantastic but you can also make a custom bowl or sushi-burrito if you want. As far as I know they're the only place in Hoboken serving proper high quality ramen. Their poké price is similar to its competitors but they give you roughly twice as much food. Can't be beat! Only one comment: if you order ramen from them you'll only get about 2/3 the food you do when dining in, I assume due to difficulty finding disposable containers big enough to fit all the food.",South Street Fish & Ramen Co,4.5 star rating,$$,"Poke, Asian Fusion, Ramen"
1,4kdSh2lkelfHpXOQAPF4rQ,Michelle C.,3.0 star rating,"4.0 Stars for Poke Bowl2.5 Stars for RamenPoke Bowl: for the base, they offer ""forbidden rice"" which is very similar to the Korean mix grain rice and I absolutely love it. They have variety of unique toppings and they give generous portions of toppings. We tried ""spicy tuna"" bowl twice. In my opinion, it has an ""Americanized"" twist as the avocado is guacamole (huh?) but it works!  I do recommend their poke bowls and I have yet to try their sushi-rrito. Ramen: My friends did not recommend their ramen but we decided to give it a try anyways. We ordered Tokyo Soy Ramen and Original Ton Tan Ramen. Boy... the noodle and broth taste like packaged ramen that you would find in the refrigerated section of Asian grocery. The onion topping is RAW - not parcook, plain raw! The egg is very good but it was cold, not even lukewarm. The pork was the only thing good about it but at $13-14, each bowl came with one piece of pork. Overall, this place is slightly pricey for what they offer.

He liked the hot and spicy which is definitely hot and spicy for my tastes.  It was good though in that you still get flavor and not deathly heat which burns your tastebuds off. He likes spicy broth just not the greens and seaweed and the mix ins except for the egg and meat... so he thought he needed extra noodles. He didn't- but we did have bubble tea beforehand which was probably the real mistake.  Needless to say- you should be easily able to get filled up by a ramen bowl here without add-ons if you're averagely hungry. I got 2/3 of the way through mine and we guess that he finished his bowl and like 1/3 or 1/4 of the noodles before he tapped out and while I am small he is more than twice my size (sorry but that's the honest truth).",South Street Fish & Ramen Co,4.5 star rating,$$,"Poke, Asian Fusion, Ramen"
