2,KP3kbJsjyOhjYFR13lRF_w,Jeff B.,4.0 star rating,"I give it four stars, but a very enthusiastic four stars.  We went here today for Valentine's Day weekend.  This place is within a range that for us lands as a bit of a budget stretcher, so this was definitely a treat and not something we would frequent.  To offer full disclosure, for two of us it ran $200 with tip.  (The economy as it is these days, the average Joe should know what they're getting into, and even menu pics don't always provide the full picture.)We shared pretty much everything.  As an appetizer, my wife requested the Chrispy Lobster Tail.  For the meal, we shared the Porterhouse for Two, the Asparagus Hollandaise, and the mashed potatoes.  To accompany dinner, we shared a red wine sangria.  The sangria ended up stretching into desert for my wife, who couldn't fit another bite of food after the main meal.  For me, desert was a glass of Glenfiddich 15 neat.  So that summarizes what we got for our money content-wise.  Now let me offer detail.The place looks nice.  It had a calm atmosphere and vibe even when a bit crowded, and the decor which contributes to that is... I would say neither old fashioned nor modern.  The appearance was not amazing to me, but certainly still very nice.Our waiter, Mike, was genuinely awesome.  Confession: restaurants higher than $$ make me uncomfortable, to be honest.  Mike, however, was very welcoming, very accessible, and his manner of interaction (whether he read my style perfectly or just happens to naturally be that way) made him immediately strike me as someone I would hang out with and get along quite well.  His suggestion of the sangria, as my wife was trying to determine a red wine that was also a bit sweet, was perfect, as was the sangria.The mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious, the asparagus was... as someone who likes to cook, it made me think, ""This is pretty much exactly how I would make it if cooking it this particular way."" I wouldn't change a thing.  The steak was an amazing cut.  Warning: while it worked perfectly for me, we ordered medium rare and it was definitely leaning towards rare.  I think it was just right.  Some parts of the steak were melt in your mouth, some a bit tough, and for the price of the meal... the steak was great, but at the same time I can say I've had better.  Here's the thing though.  Steakhouses $$$ or higher, when it comes to steak, tend to have a knack for doing an amazing job on the seasoning for their steaks, to the point where you can happily forgive that you can taste that.  This place... the way they make it allows the steak to really speak for itself.  And in truth, that's the way to do it.  So if you want that general steakhouse flavor, at least on the cut we ordered, that's not what you'll find, and so it might seem a bit bland even, though still an amazing cut and delicious.  However, if you like the purist approach of a steak prepared in a manner where nothing gets in the way of the steak's own natural flavor, this is definitely a place you would enjoy.  Either way, as I said, don't get me wrong, it was delicious.If I were to make one suggestion to this restaurant, it would be to invest in some Glencairn glasses.  When you're into Scotch, and you order a single malt neat at a fancy restaurant but they bring it to you in an octogonal old-fashion glass, to me it was a bit of a let down.  This may sound insane to the less initiated, but the glass can actually make a surprising difference in taste simply based on how particular glasses allow a drink to breathe in different ways and deliver the drink's scent to you in different ways.  Just as martinis are served in martini glasses, etc., there's a practical purpose to the different shapes of different drink glasses.  This restaurant has a decent selection of cognacs and scotches and bourbons, so getting some Glencairn glasses for those who order scotch neat would be a definite upgrade to their game in that area.Overall, a good experience.  The wife was happy, and that in itself makes it a win.  Based on our experience today, you can go here expecting great friendly service, delicious food and drink, and weather permitting, a nice walk with a view of NYC afterward.  Can you find and enjoy better for the price?  I think so.  However, if you have an idea of what you're getting into (as I've endeavored to provide here), I also believe that you absolutely would not regret going, and (no pun intended) would have no reservations about going back the next time there's an occasion to do so.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

7,PYK-V7agsy8DQq3VlotnKg,Christina N.,5.0 star rating,First time ever having Ruth's Chris and it was such a great experience. Our server Dorian was great and occasionally checked up on us to see how we were doing. My friend and I (emmi g. Also a yelper) happened to come during restaurant week and the restaurant had a special going on where you get a 3 course lunch menu only for 20$!! You honestly can't beat that. The restaurant also offers happy hour from 4-7p with food starting at 9$ and drinks for 14$ Upon entering in we were greeted by the hostess and offered us if we wanted our coats checked in. We were also seated right away considering the fact that we had a reservation and there were not too many people at the time we arrived. Complimentary bread and butter was served as a starter and I ordered the steak house salad that came with a light vinaigrette dressing that was surprisingly very delicious. For my choice of entree I was contemplating on getting the fresh wild salmon or petite filet cause both sounded really good. Dorian suggested that we each get one or the other so that we can both try and share it so that's what we did. We also did that with the choice of personal side and got the garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which complimented our entree dishes really well. The fish was very flaky and tender but cooked a little bit dry for my liking but over all very tasty. The filet was cooked perfectly and cutting into it was like cutting butter. It was so tender and so juicy. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. As a choice of dessert we got the cheesecake served with fresh berries that was a great ending to our delicious meal. My over all experience was so great and I love how cozy and intimate the place felt with the dim lighting and candle lit at the table. It's definitely the type of restaurant to go to if you want to impress your date or anyone matter of fact. I highly recommend!!!!!!,Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

Situated right across the street from the riverfront, which boasts beautiful vistas of the Manhattan skyline. It's too bad, however, that it's not really visible from inside the restaurant, as there's a big condo complex blocking it. I was pleasantly surprised the food was as good, and well prepared, as I wasn't sure if it had gone downhill since it's a chain, and there are a lot of them now! (The last time I went to a Ruth Chris was 1998 (20 yrs ago, right after I graduated college and started my first real job) that one was in Parsippany (or E. Hanover?), NJ. When I was 22, that was like ""woah expensive"", so I thought I was pretty badass! Anyhow, steaks were tasty and cooked right (temperature wise), and sides delish!

We went in during a weekday so the place was pretty empty which we do prefer. We started with lobster bisque and their tuna tartar. I did wish the lobster bisque had more lobster and tuna pieces could have been thicker- was a bit disappointed about that. However, our meal was fantastic! My friend got the cowboy cut and I got the crab cakes. We also got the mushroom and grilled asparagus for our side- both were perfectly cooked. The steak was so juicy and tender and crab cakes were full of meat and not too salty. We obviously ordered way too much and couldn't finish it all. We really shouldn't have ordered a dessert but we got the creme brûlée which also did not disappoint.

I called for reservations the day of and they were able to accommodate my requests for my boyfriends birthday. They asked if it was a special occasion and I told them it was a birthday over the phone. When we were seated by the host she said ""I heard we are celebrating a special birthday tonight"" and sprinkled the table with happy birthday confetti. I thought this was such a cute start to the night and I never saw this done before! We started with some drinks I had the rosemary raspberry cosmopolitan. This was fresh, light and fruity I loved this drink. To start we had the Caesar salad which was delicious- it had pieces of fresh parmesan and fresh black pepper. For dinner I had the petit filet which was a smaller 8 oz cut. It was tender and delicious. However I did ask for it medium well and it came out rather medium with a lot of pink. I told the waitress and she brought out a hot sizzling plate for me to cook my pieces how I liked it which was cool. The manager also came over after and stated that there steaks usually do come out a little less cooked because the plate it comes on is 500 degrees and still cooks the meat! I appreciated there service. For the sides we got the lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. These were just ok honestly the Mac and cheese lacked flavor and was a bit cold. For dessert they brought out an apple cheesecake for my boyfriends birthday and we ordered a creme brûlée. Creme brûlée was lacking the textures a bit.

No thanks. Crab stack appetizer was not good and just lumps of cold mushy crab meat with some vegetables and fruit. The crab and tomato soup was okay. Fried calamari was okay but how can something fried taste bad.The steaks were good but not cooked according to instruction-medium rare orders were over cooked.I just had a lobster Mac and cheese side as my main dish and while it was tasty, it was just too drenched in butter and too rich to finish. Lobster to macaroni pasta ratio is like 0.05, which is sad.

The fish was very flaky and tender but cooked a little bit dry for my liking but over all very tasty. The filet was cooked perfectly and cutting into it was like cutting butter. It was so tender and so juicy. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. As a choice of dessert we got the cheesecake served with fresh berries that was a great ending to our delicious meal. My over all experience was so great and I love how cozy and intimate the place felt with the dim lighting and candle lit at the table. It's definitely the type of restaurant to go to if you want to impress your date or anyone matter of fact. I highly recommend!!!!!!,Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

Situated right across the street from the riverfront, which boasts beautiful vistas of the Manhattan skyline. It's too bad, however, that it's not really visible from inside the restaurant, as there's a big condo complex blocking it. I was pleasantly surprised the food was as good, and well prepared, as I wasn't sure if it had gone downhill since it's a chain, and there are a lot of them now! (The last time I went to a Ruth Chris was 1998 (20 yrs ago, right after I graduated college and started my first real job) that one was in Parsippany (or E. Hanover?), NJ. When I was 22, that was like ""woah expensive"", so I thought I was pretty badass! Anyhow, steaks were tasty and cooked right (temperature wise), and sides delish!

We went in during a weekday so the place was pretty empty which we do prefer. We started with lobster bisque and their tuna tartar. I did wish the lobster bisque had more lobster and tuna pieces could have been thicker- was a bit disappointed about that. However, our meal was fantastic! My friend got the cowboy cut and I got the crab cakes. We also got the mushroom and grilled asparagus for our side- both were perfectly cooked. The steak was so juicy and tender and crab cakes were full of meat and not too salty. We obviously ordered way too much and couldn't finish it all. We really shouldn't have ordered a dessert but we got the creme brûlée which also did not disappoint.

I called for reservations the day of and they were able to accommodate my requests for my boyfriends birthday. They asked if it was a special occasion and I told them it was a birthday over the phone. When we were seated by the host she said ""I heard we are celebrating a special birthday tonight"" and sprinkled the table with happy birthday confetti. I thought this was such a cute start to the night and I never saw this done before! We started with some drinks I had the rosemary raspberry cosmopolitan. This was fresh, light and fruity I loved this drink. To start we had the Caesar salad which was delicious- it had pieces of fresh parmesan and fresh black pepper. For dinner I had the petit filet which was a smaller 8 oz cut. It was tender and delicious. However I did ask for it medium well and it came out rather medium with a lot of pink. I told the waitress and she brought out a hot sizzling plate for me to cook my pieces how I liked it which was cool. The manager also came over after and stated that there steaks usually do come out a little less cooked because the plate it comes on is 500 degrees and still cooks the meat! I appreciated there service. For the sides we got the lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. These were just ok honestly the Mac and cheese lacked flavor and was a bit cold. For dessert they brought out an apple cheesecake for my boyfriends birthday and we ordered a creme brûlée. Creme brûlée was lacking the textures a bit.

Fried calamari was okay but how can something fried taste bad.The steaks were good but not cooked according to instruction-medium rare orders were over cooked.I just had a lobster Mac and cheese side as my main dish and while it was tasty, it was just too drenched in butter and too rich to finish.

My steak looked like a thick New York strip and the blue cheese crust looked like it was just sprinkled on. Not even melted.I asked the waiter whose name was Alfonso to verify if my steak was ribeye and he looked and he agreed it did not look like a ribeye he took my steak and went to go back to the kitchen. (I tasted my bf steak who also ordered the ribeye but the 16 ounce, compared it to mine and it was a major difference!) Then the manager on duty whose name was Rebecca came to our table and asked if there was something wrong with the steak. Mind you she was rude, did not have a smile on her face, and seemed like she had a stick up her ass. So I explained to her that my steak did not taste like a ribeye and that I always get the ribeye each time. She tried to say that the 12 oz ribeye are a different cut now and blah blah blah. I told her it's fine I will just eat my BF other half of his steak she said ok and walked away.......As a manager I was hoping she would offer to do anything to keep us satisfied.

Needless to say, I devoured it.  The bf chose the salad option which was good, but standard. On to the main event, bf ordered the petite filet and it was perfectly cooked and amazing. I opted for the salmon which was excellent as well.  Our sides were both delish...garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. For wine we had a chardonnay and malbec off of the restaurant week menu.

It was my first time booking a reservation that required a contract and I had a lot of questions. He didn't call me an ametuer but he made me feel like one. I felt this manager was rude to my mom's guests. When he brought out the hot steak plates, naturally someone went to grab their 100+ degree plate and he yelled at them like they were a child. Granted he was trying to help but we're adults and guests, watch how you speak to someone and if you're that terrified about the plates, stop serving them so hot. The last con was my filet mignon. It looked like a blob of meat. It was my first time trying it and I was told it would be so tender I could cut it with a butter knife....more like a saw!Anyway my mom was happy so I was happy.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

The room with no windows no view, I had hoped there would be a view since the NY skyline is just outside the restaurant--oh well. I ordered the 6 oz. Tender Steak With Shrimp, the steak was the best thing I ate that night,  buttery, delicious, tender & juicy. It was cooked to perfectly Medium just as I had asked. It only came with 3 small broiled shrimp, I wish they had given me more. Carrot ginger soup was delicious I wish the serving was larger.  Sides were 'creamed spinach' , 'crab rice', 'mashed potatoes'.  Side dishes were rich.  On the downside I wasn't  impressed by the flavor of the mashed potatoes which tasted like 'instant'. And the worst thing was only one drink was offered to me all evening by the wait staff, and we were there for hours. There were no pitchers of drinks, or even a water pitcher on the table. By the end of the night I was very thirsty. Sides were served family style passed around the table in very teeny-tiny dishes that were more suited for just one person not for a group. I found myself holding back from taking the portion I really wanted because I wanted to make sure others at the table also had enough. I'm not an excessive eater but I found I didn't have enough food on my plate. I didn't speak up about this because I didn't want to offend my host who had thrown the party and make them feel bad/embarrassed. Basically the food was very good, but there just wasn't enough of a good thing to go around.  Desert was 'Apple Gallet' which had a scoup of vanilla ice cream on it, but I could tell it wasn't 'Hagen Daz' as another reviewer said theirs was.

81,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,4.0 star rating,"Went for Hudson Restaurant Week LunchFood - 5/5. The butter they give you with the complimentary bread is amazingly smooth. It is salted as well so it goes great with the thick cut bread they give you. The Lobster Bisque is full of rich roasted lobster shell flavor and you can really taste that slight hint of brandy they used to finish the bisque. There was no lobster meat in the soup but considering the prix fixe nature of the meal, this wasn't a problem. The Petite Filet is the absolute winner in this menu as it is the most tender piece of steak I have had! They serve the steak on a sizzling platter of butter, but I would say the steak has a greater buttery texture than the butter it is sitting on, as that Petite Filet just melts in your mouth with every bite. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes are smooth as well, but it wasn't as noticeable since it competed with the Petite Filet. Their Bread Pudding was alright. I wish the whisky sweet cream sauce was a bit more noticeable as it was soaked entirely into the bread pudding which made it hard to distinguish its flavor along with the rest of the dessert.Service - 3/5. Normally the level of service I received would be great but since this is a higher end restaurant, I expected a little more attention to detail. They are minor things, but that is what separates good and great scores. The waiter never refilled my water and I had to ask the busboy to do it. Silverware wasn't removed properly per course. The waiter placed the check on the table before I was even finished with my dessert. They also have an odd system of making you use their credit card payment system on the table. Again, these are minor complaints but at their price range, I think the little things matter.Value - 4/5. The regular menu prices are extremely high so the $20 lunch prix fixe for Hudson Restaurant Week was a great bargain to try out Ruth's. With their food quality being top notch, I definitely think the $20 price tag is worth it.Parking - Mall Lot (Free)",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

87,x3cyzMa37JvY3HSNoTolsA,Flora T.,2.0 star rating,"I visited this establishment for the first time, last week to celebrate my birthday. Atmosphere: A large restaurant with dim lighting and standard steak house decor like lots of wood detailing, white table cloths, and romantic ambiance. The establishment hosts a great view of NYC depending on where you sit.Food: let me preface by saying, I've been to many steakhouses around the country and the world. My standards are high and my taste buds expect even higher. Initially I was really disappointed with the menu choices. I know I should have looked at the menu before coming here but I wanted to go some place with a nice view for my birthday. I typically always order oysters or a seafood tower with oysters. This place had no oysters at all. I then looked at their other choices for appetizers and none of them seemed appetizing to me. Also, the prices were outrageous. So, we ordered the cowboy ribeye steak with lobster Mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, and asparagus as our sides. I asked for our steak to be medium rare and it was more medium well. Additionally, there was no flavor at all. It was as if it was never marinated, aged or seasoned. The brussel sprouts were also underwhelming and generally speaking, I enjoy them with a bit of browning or char to them. The lobster Mac and cheese was very runny. It tasted like it was all milk....ewww just ewww. I was so turned off by this that I didn't even bother finishing my steak or anything else for that matter. I didn't even bother with the asparagus. The portions were generous but honestly it still didn't justify the quality of the food and the prices. We didn't bother ordering dessert but the restaurant did give us dessert on the house since it was my birthday. I had the Hagen daz ice cream and didn't even bother trying their baked cake or cookie.Service: I don't remember or waiters name but he was funny. I did mention to home that I didn't enjoy our meal and he didn't apologize or try to make it right or even ask why I didn't enjoy it. Tip: if you are going to charge outrageous amount of money for food, please justify it to your patrons by explaining why. He could have explained to me the aging process, or where the food comes from or anything else for that matter but he brushed off my dissatisfaction, as if he is used to hearing it. I also constantly had to flag him down. The restaurant wasn't full, so I just don't enjoy working to get service, especially on my birthday. I will say this, our waiter made a dull meal entertaining. Overall: I will not be returning to this establishment because there are much better steakhouses within the same or less price range. I do not think the prices justify the food or view.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

We split a Caesar salad to start which was a decent portion. The lobster Mac and cheese was to die for that I had called dibs on the table that no one else was supposed to eat it anymore because I was taking it home to savor for later. We had Brussels sprouts that tasted delicious and bacon bits brought out the flavor. We celebrated a birthday so they helped us celebrate by indulging in a chocolate duo with a Happy Birthday written on the dish. They sprinkled some confetti on the table before we ordered too just to celebrate. It was cute. Our waitress was wonderful. Oh wait I almost forgot to mention that we also took a cheesecake to go.

But my husband and I were disappointed.Appetizers came out before wine.  Ordered mushrooms off the specials and were told at first course they ran out. (It's Sunday with a 4pm reservation). Appetizers came out and the runner slowly poured/spilled out the sauce from our ravioli dish onto the table.  I don't think he was paying attention. My mother had a full plate of salad and I had some salad in my plate too and they started to clear the plates from my husband and father and then reached for my salad as well as my mothers without asking if we were done. (We weren't done, and now felt rushed) At this point I went to talk to the manager because I wanted to be sure we weren't rushed for rest of meal and that we we're celebrating that evening.  Went back to table which was full of breadcrumbs.  They never cleaned or crumbed.  Dinner came out and my husband had to ask for a steak knife.  We ordered the porterhouse for two medium rare. It came out medium/medium well.  I don't like to send things back but this steak is over $90.  They gave us an extra order of creamed spinach on the house, which was nice.  But we had ordered the first one for my husband because he's the only one that likes it.  So my husband enjoyed two, by himself.  After dinner, ordered a chocolate sin cake with a candle for my mom.  But when I it came out, there was no candle. I was a bit confused, so I asked if he could put a candle in it.  He also seemed confused and said a candle was coming? And then another cake comes out with a candle.  I'm glad we got got the candle, but I would think the birthday cake would come out first?There are some other steakhouses my husband and I have wanted to try.  I think this is a good time to start.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

Outside of one other experience, I don't think that I have enough steakhouse experiences in my repertoire to make any judgements here. Luckily, my boyfriend and I ventured to this location on Sunday.Food-wise, everything was really good. The steaks come topped with parsley butter and mine was cooked exactly as I had asked (between medium rare to rare). Word of advice, don't ask for a medium well or well done steak; it's an act of horror to eat a meat brick for dinner. Regardless, I do hold some qualms against the sides and the lobster bisque. The bisque itself was good, but I didn't like how the lobster pieces were cold against the hot soup and the creamed spinach could use A LOT more seasoning, I mean a lot.Unfortunately, our entrees were enough to feed us to the point we didn't even consider dessert, although I would've loved to try the creme brûlée.

RC I would say was fairly good, not amazing, but a place worth repeating if I were with a large party. This particular location had great service but I wish I could have gave the food an equivalent rating.CONS:- The sizzling plate presentation throws off the desired temperature. I knew this prior to my visit.  I had ordered medium-rare and the end result was a marbled medium, medium-rare Cowboy Ribeye.- What steak place doesn't have their own steak sauce? If A1 is beneath you, at least come up with your own sauce. Butter is not a sauce. Who do I look like, Paula Dean?- For this particular location, slightly slacking on the water refills.PROS:+ The service here was excellent.

But the quality of the meat was ehhhhh. Every bite was very chewy or tough. Not a lot of good meat on the steak. It was seasoned great, don't get me wrong, but I might've gotten a bad cut of meat. I think my expectations were too high and was disappointed by the quality of the meat. Had steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes as sides and the mashed potatoes were the best. THAT was really good.

One of my favorite sides here is the roasted brussel sprouts with bacon...to die for! My usual go-to steak is the ribeye or the NY Strip both of which are always perfectly cooked.

My husband and I double dated with another couple and met up for a fairly early dinner. I like the ambience of the restaurant. Fancy and with the view of the city. I ordered the lobster bisque based on the good reviews I read and was really let down. I didn't like the taste and the lack of lobster meat. I've had better. I ordered the 12oz rib eye with creamed spinach as my entree and my husband ordered the cowboy rib eye with hash browns. I liked my husbands order a lot better than mine! The creamed spinach was watery. Finally, we split the apple tart for dessert. Wasn't a fan. I think this place is too overpriced for the quality that is served. Also, our server for the night wasn't very attentive and we waited a long time for refills/check/etc. Overall I should have just stuck with my original opinion of the place.

The lobster bisque tastes like old cigarettes, or what I think old cigarettes would taste like. I kindly placed the bread pudding to the side after one bite. I like for my waiter or server to come check on me a few times and Lonny didn't seem interested in doing that. Whenever he did come over he had cute jokes.

The calamari was perfectly fried and didn't feel like a heavy appetizer. I got the surf and turf on a 500 degree hot plate (don't touch them or you'll get burned!)- my steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the lobster had great flavor even without the butter sauce. We got mashed potatoes and fire-roasted corn to split and they were a great choice to balance out all the meat.For dessert we had cheesecake and the chocolate explosion (lava-cake style dessert).

167,dXn2XS83zbIBofjMcVJURw,Rachelle K.,1.0 star rating,"We have been to this location of Ruth Chris many times and were very excited to see the renovations for the first time.  We went on a Saturday night with friends.  First, the good.  The bar renovation is beautiful, with a large section of tables and booths in the back (reservations required) and low and high tables in the front (first come, first served) in the front by a large horseshoe shaped bar.  The room is well done in browns and bronzes with nice lighting.  Now, the bad.  We waited 30 minutes for drinks, and we only got them that quickly because we practically tackled a bus boy and and then a server walking by.  Our actual waiter only showed up minutes before our drinks came, almost 30 minutes in.  Very frustrating for us, and expensive for them.  If they'd served us timely, we would have ordered two rounds of drinks and probably appetizers - clock that at a loss of 75-100 bucks.We were seated for dinner within minutes of our reservation time.  The updates to the dining room were nice as well, in the same colors.  The room was a bit crowded due to the addition of several more tables than before, but the high ceilings accommodated the noise levels quite well and we could comfortably chat at a table for four.Our server was attentive and quickly took drink orders and came back right away to take our orders as well.  Three of us ordered 16 oz ribeye steaks at $47 each, and one of us ordered a 2 and 3/4 lb lobster at $85.  We also ordered appetizers and potatoes au gratin and brussel sprouts to share, as well as a nice bottle of wine.  Our appetizers came timely and were good, as was the hot fresh bread and butter.  The dinners however, were a grave disappointment.  the steaks were thin and over cooked, and the lobster was 1 and 1/2 lb, at best, and so overcooked it was inedible and sent back to the kitchen.  The potatoes au gratin were soupy and the brussel sprouts tough.  We dine out often at 4 and 5 star restaurants and are accomplished home cooks as well.  We cook lobster at home regularly and know the sizes and appropriate cooking techniques, and what the right texture should be when done correctly.  We know fine dining, what it costs and requires to deliver quality meals and don't mind paying at all.  However, when i pay 50 bucks for a steak i expect a quality cut of meat cooked to my specifications.  The lobster that was delivered was so obviously not what they advertised and the sides were really a joke.  They comped the lobster and gave us free desserts, but they were nothing special and our nice evening out was marred.  These guys have a premium location but they need to get their act together on service and the quality in the kitchen.I would suggest you try the bar to watch a game and drinks, but take a pass on the low quality and overpriced dining room.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

Besides the fact that you could tell that they squeezed tables into the lobby to make more room for guests and we were seated one table away from the waiting customers and in front of the door to get to the patio dining...a single man was allowed to sit at a table for 6 behind us. He must have been important because our waiter dotted on him and didn't make much effort to do anything for us.  20 minutes for our drinks??? And then we had to prompt the hostess to find our waiter...MICHAEL... to finally bring them. I was planning on spending a little over $100 on a wonderful meal for myself and was so disappointed in every way. Ordered stuffed mushrooms...hardly any crab meat..no garnish..4 giant mushrooms...pretty disgusting.  Then the ala carte dinner...my lamb chops on a white dish splattered in grease...no garnish. Plate was scalding hot...have you not heard of metal broiler plates that sit in a wooden base?? My sister explained to me that the dirty, non garnished plates are part of the theme... rustic...right out of the oven.... prices or ambience don't reflect that concept. I'm old school and eat my lamb well done....see photo....does that look well done to you????  Asparagus on another white plate steamed perfectly but not trimmed properly so very woody and stringy at the ends. Sauce on side.  Waiter didn't come to check on us until we were almost done.

Butter makes anything taste good so I'm not going to rave about it because it's nothing to rave about. I have been here a few times with no real complaints. However, I went on NYE and the reception staff was horrendous. It wasn't even busy. I walked in and said hello with several staff standing at the door and not one greeted me or said anything after I, the customer, said hello first. In fact, they just stared back at me. Very rude. Not one smile. I cannot stand it when I arrive at a restaurant or any establishment and staff are standing around, no greeting and no response when the customer ends up greeting THEM! Completely ill-mannered, untrained and downright rude! The service at the table was also quite poor. The manager randomly came over with a fake smile plastered on asking, in an extremely fake manner, if everything was ok. Of course it wasn't but I wasn't going to embarrass the man.  Train your staff!!!  Service was generally slow. Then the fruit dessert with cream in a cup came without spoons and we had to flag someone down after several minutes to finally get spoons. Ridiculous. Spoons should come when the dessert that clearly requires spoons are placed on the table. All in all a poor experience.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

198,W1vOAhJEXaTQbpKFKLwDeQ,JC I.,2.0 star rating,"50th Anniversary Dinner - They had a special event celebrating their 50th Anniversary with a 5 course meal paired with 5 wines. The food is still very good however the 2 stars is for the organization. There was zero organization last night. They took a credit card ahead of time for a $50 hold to ensure people would attend. When we walked in, as a couple, our hostess brought us to a table where two women had already been seated. I asked, what's this? The hostess said, well since we have limited space, we are having combined seating!!!? WTF? Are you kidding me? AT $95/pp, you want me and my wife to sit with strangers? I've never in 40 years heard of such nonsense! When they saw me getting angry, the hostess said, hold on, I'll tell our manager. Manager comes to speak with us - and as he's walking towards us, I see another couple who walked in right before us, get up from their table and walk out. Apparently, they had no interest in sharing their dinner with strangers either. Manager tells me well since the space is limited, they are asking people to sit together. I told him, we have a young child and we never get a chance to go out alone. This was a first in two years and that I was not planning on spending my $ or my dinner with strangers sitting two inches away from us. He admitted he understood as he had a young child as well and said have a seat, enjoy yourselves and I'll make sure noone sits next to you to. FINE, that solved the issue but it left a very bad taste in our mouths. The wine choices were very good. However, seemed like they had very short supply of the wines for this event. I only expected to have one glass of each wine they paired, but when I looked around, other patrons were getting seconds of requested glasses. Even the woman who came around explaining what wine went with each course advised to ""feel free"" to ask for more. Two out of the 3 glasses we asked for, our waiter said there was none left. Also, a patron sitting across from our table had them bring out a full glass of the tequila and bourbon drink - so I asked for one, same thing. They didn't have any more. However, as the 5th wine came out, they did come back to me and gave me a shot of the tequila. It was very good, just handled in a very unprofessional way. I even offered to pay separately for my additional drinks, however just seemed that they had very limited bottles. As for the location itself, this was maybe our 4th visit - ahead of time I mentioned in my reservation that this was out 5th Annivarsary. Then called back on Tuesday to confirm they got the message. They hadn't but said ok, we'll make sure we celebrate with you once you are here. Not surprisingly, not a word of our anniversary. Now normally, I wouldn't expect much, but on our 2nd anniversary, we came here and they had rose petals on the table and sat us down and brought us over two complimentary glasses of champagne and the staff came over to us and congratulated us. That service has clearly gone far away as this evening couldn't be further from that first encounter. Also, Ruth's Chris used to be a more formal venue, last night many patrons were in shorts, polo shirts and the diners looked more like they were going to a Houlihans or TGIF's rather than a high-end steak house. I'm very disappointed and guess we will have to find another steak house in the area as the quality of service has gone down hill. The steaks are still very good, but don't expect to feel pampered at this location.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

200,ppKU_LZg66rcaj0bB43gdQ,Susan E.,3.0 star rating,"We just had dinner here on Saturday with friends. We had a reservation and after having drinks at the bar, we were escorted to our table. First thing I noticed....Gosh, these tables are crammed in tightly. Seated at our table, we were enjoying the conversation in the table next to ours with no problem!! (seriously way too close!) Anyway, this appears to be an excellent location but they ruined the atmosphere by overcrowding the dining area to gain another buck or two by adding more tables. How disappointing!The serving staff seemed to be rushed too. The steak at $56 was an excellent cut of steak, cooked well, but really so under seasoned.  We all needed to add salt and pepper. Couple the steak with a side of potato ($10) and creamed spinach ($10) the steak entree was $76. Plus, the harsh reality was when they serve you a hot plate with only a steak on it....no garnish... ..just a plain white plate with meat on it.....they get a ZERO for presentation.I enjoy elegant dining and understand that generally wine prices are double what you pay in the liquor store, which is fine. After all, it's a business and they need to make money. However, Ruth Chris charges 3 and 4 times of what you could purchase a bottle of wine for in the liquor store! After dinner, we all ordered cappuccino's. The problem was they served all 4 of them room temperature or cold. After we told her the cappuccino was cold, the waitress insisted that because there was froth on top, they had to be hot. You could feel the cup and feel it was cold but we said, ""stick you finger in there! They are cold!"" So, she went back and got us new ones but served them with an attitude.Overall, I rated this experience 3 stars but it wasn't anything special nor was it anything outstanding. I feel it was overpriced for a mediocre meal. Although the steak was good, when you compare the price, the atmosphere, the coldness of the wait staff, and the cramped quarters, you could find a lot better elegant dining for less money, served with a smile!",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

I was very happy that we did not have to wait very long. We did not opt-in for the Valet Parking, because it took the 3 cars in line 15 minutes to be parked, not sure what was going on with that.When we were shown to our table the spectacle began.  I did notice that we were the youngest successful couple there, which was really cool. Our waiter asked us did we liked any water, glass or bottle. We declined at first, because we were starving. Nonetheless, we had 3 people ask us if we wanted water, this was in between the couple of minutes they give you to get familiar with your order. They were so persistent that we finally gave in and decided to have Perrier Sparkling Water. I have never seen 4 different people wait on me at the same time, with that much passion and concern, it was truly amazing. To shorten this story, the service was the best that I have ever experienced.I ordered the Filet Mignon with a cognac butter sauce, I paired it with a side of Spinach au Gratin. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir to top it off. The food seasoned perfectly. I do agree that the filet does come with a lot of butter, but that was something that I did not mind.

The only thing we didn't like, which is why I removed a star, was that he asked for his steak cooked medium well and he received it closer to medium rare.

They had a special Graduates Eat Free which was nice. We made sure to take a cell phone picture of his diploma for proof just in case they asked (which they did). We had requested a table near the window with the view and they accommodated us with that. Also, our table was decorated with confetti which we did not request but was a wonderful surprise. We were also allowed to bring our own cake from our favorite bakery and they cut and served it with not extra charge. Our two waiters were very attentive and service was fast, almost too fast! We were done in like 2 hours! They were great with their suggestions as far as sharing appetizers and the side dishes which were enough for 2-3 people to share.  And the steak! WOW! We don't eat steak much at home so going someplace like this was a real treat. For the money it cost, we were not disappointed. (other places we've gone to like Delfriscos and Uncle Jacks in NYC were a lot of hype and not worth it) Ruth Chris could have gone that way too being a chain restaurant. We were so pleasantly surprised and pleased that we can't wait until the next occasion to go back. Everyone said their steak was cooked to perfection (that was everyones exact words!) and each different tenderness was exactly what was asked for. I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the parking issue. There is complimetary valet but its about a 1/2 block walk to the front door of the restaurant. Some of our party are disabled and cannot walk that distance. My husband had to drop us at the door. But there is no self parking lot for Ruth Chris. You have to park at Houlihans and walk a block or two to get there. If its raining (which it was) its not a pleasant distance to walk.

So Friday night my boyfriend and I wanted to just go out for some drinks and a quick bite but everywhere we went it was a long wait and well we didn't want to end up at Houlihans again for drinks and apps so we drove around and realized we had never been to Ruth Chris steakhouse .. So we parked right next door down in the lot, we walked in and were welcomed by two very nice host who were so welcoming I was surprised, the host who sat us mentioned she just came back to work from a leave I believe or something like that, she was wearing some cool stockings which I pointed out and she thanked me for. I thought she was the sweetest. Then we were sat at a window table towards the end of the restaurant, my boyfriend had the best seat facing the window and well I'm used to it already so I didn't mind lol. Our server was quick to come by and he introduced himself, Michael. I can't begin to express how amazing Michael treated us, he was so attentive we felt so special from beginning to end. He helped us choose our glass of wine and made it feel so personal, I'm so happy he did because I actually found my favorite wine that night! He continued to suggest apps and side dishes .. Like the sweet potato casserole omg epic! It was so amazing you just have to try it, totally complimented my lamb chops. By the way my boyfriend ordered the T-bone steak which was cooked to perfection, I ordered the lamb chops and it was the best set of lamb chops I have ever had in my entire life! I will be taking my family here because they don't believe me how good those lamb chops were! Anywho.. We continued the amazing night to being so ridiculously full we even had to take two lamb chops home and some sides!

It was so creamy and so fresh, I'm thinking about going back just to have that.. A quick fix lol. Anyways I loved Ruth Chris Steakhouse for the epic food and over the top service!

We were celebrating my fiancée's sister's birthday with her family. Our waiter (I'm so sorry, I didn't catch your name), always referred to my fiancée's father by name, and made it known that he was aware of her sister's birthday by wishing her a happy birthday. He brought her a small cake with fruit on the house, with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate in chocolate syrup.As for the food, it was solid. I ordered a filet, which was a slightly more cooked than I expected, as I ordered it medium-rare, but it was certainly not burnt. It was served on a tastefully buttered plate. The meat was a succulent thick, and when it was gone I realized just how filling it was. The creamed spinach was my favorite appetizer.Ruth's Chris is a chain, and yes there are far more fancier options awaiting you just across the Hudson River.

The manager needed instructions on what medium rare is. We frequent the Parsippany location and this did not come anywhere close. It felt like the ""other"" crew was on deck for Sunday nights. For an anniversary date night, we expected more. Downtown looks beautiful with or without the restaurant - should have eaten at Chart House, which is were we started our night with drinks. Tuna was good, shrimp cocktail was good, as well as the wedge salad. The amount of butter on the salmon and potatoes was disgusting...and then went the fateful steak came out for my husband...we called it a day. They did comp us the dessert.

Ordered tomato, mozz salad that Shauna had split into two portions for us.  Great suggestion. Horrible execution. One plate had dressing smeared all over the plate and over the edges of the plate.  It was obvious that the salad was chopped in half and swiped across to another plate.  Guy filling water glasses spilled ice cubes all over the table and never bothered to clean them up.  He just walked away. Ribeye and petit filet were perfectly cooked as ordered.  Baked potato with all the fixings spot on.  Lyonnaise potatoes, a tad cool, a bit greasy.  Not likely to be ordered again.Dessert - berries and cream.  Strawberries were about as sweet as cucumbers.  Out of season, obviously and the ones they got, most likely from Mexico, not any riper.  Blackberries were better.Not a bad experience, but for the price, I agree with some of the other reviewers that it's a maybe.  Will try out Morton's first before coming back, though.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

282,WxNqupdvjLfxUr5JhczipQ,Sean C.,3.0 star rating,"Despite the best efforts of chain restaurants to provide a rigorously consistent experience and quality bar across all of their locations to assuage culinary xenophobia, pesky human factors make this a near impossible goal (unless both the initial and final products are so processed and meticulously controlled that the pinnacle of what can be produced under such process is a McDonald's quarter pounder - and anyone who has visited a McD's in Europe or Asia will know that even that consistency is only defined on a national level.) Thus, it comes as no surprise that all Ruth's Chris are not created equal beyond the chronically misstated name.While they may not have invented it, Ruth's Chris is the home of the scalding hot plate used to both keep a finely buttered, juicy steak warm throughout the meal and provide an efficient manner for diners to correct an undercooking job (which, although temperatures are usually spot on, if one's preference is between grades, order under rather than over.) Unlike other locations, over the 10+ years my family has come here, first for diversity and now due to all of their other familiar haunts having gone out of business, we have had consistently above average if not inspiring or exceptional dinner experiences unlike the walking distance location.On the most recent jaunt on Thanksgiving to the slightly swank, which was packed with families (including my own) thankful for not having to cook their own dinner or tolerate unconstrained domestic hours of sub-optimal blood relations and staff that managed to stay positive despite this, I skipped the turkey (having had my fill of ""bird"" on a recent vacation) and opted for the mid-grade prix fixe dinner splurge ($43) of:- Seafood gumbo that was barely spicy and needed not the extra carb shot of rice- Green beans that, despite the roasted garlic, butter and spices, were still flavorless- 6oz filet mignon properly cooked and worthy of a high-end steakhouse- Three forgettable shrimp sadly garnishing the aforementioned filet- Decadent pumpkin cheesecake small enough to indulge without noticeable guilt- Excellent, rich dark chocolate pecan bark (which could easily be its own dessert)For a family holiday meal I was greatly satisfied. Perusing the rest of the menu, the prix fixe, which appears to be offered all the time and allows for 4-5 choices in each category excluding dessert (where substitutions are $3), is the way to go unless one has a bulging wallet and a burning passion for a slew of unavailable choices.I've never been intrinsically excited to dine here, but for omnivores who appreciate a steakhouse on rails, one can do far worse than Ruth's Chris - just don't touch the steak plates unless one is looking to add a burn treatment bill to the evening's tab.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

I had a party of 20 here for a celebration, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice restaurant for a big party because the staff was exceptional and really made sure the celebration was special for everyone.One of the managers help me create a banquet menu for the dinner beforehand, which made everything easier the day of. A few of us got there 30 minutes early, and the table was already set and ready for us. We were seated right away and while we waited for the others to arrive, the manager, sommelier, and waiter came to introduce themselves. They made sure we had enough bread (and alcohol) to keep us happy. As soon as everyone arrived, we placed our orders and everything went smoothly. The staff was very professional, personable, and responsive throughout the night. I am very impressed with the way they handled the dinner party. There were a few ""difficult"" guests but they were able to make sure everyone was happy. All their food was delicious - I highly recommend the calamari, stuffed mushrooms, rib eye, and cheesecake, but you could be happy eating anything from their menu.There were also a few minor mishaps (e.x. dishes getting swapped between guests), but they always immediately found a way to fix the mistake or find an alternative solution. No restaurant or person can get it right every single time, but I really appreciated that they went out of their way to accommodate or make up for any mistakes that may have happened. They also included extra touches to make sure the celebration was special - preparing an additional complementary appetizer that I originally wanted to include in the menu, having celebration-themed confetti on the table, etc. If you are looking to host a large party here, my only suggestion would be to make sure the seating arrangements are set the way you want. I didn't think to discuss it beforehand so they arranged the party in a long row with ten people on each side of the table, which made it difficult for everyone to talk with each other.Overall, I very much enjoyed my experience at Ruth's Chris and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to host a large dinner party.

From the meat that melted like butter in your mouth, to the seasoning it was an amazing steak. Great size as well. One thing I found interesting was the fact that the steaks are served on plates that are 500 degrees. And yes they are THAT hot. Even touching the plate for a second can leave a nice burn. But this act of near business negligence, leaves your steak hot and juicy till the very last bite.The atmosphere of the establishment is very elegant and while you don't need to arrive to the place in a suit, its nice to dress up and have an amazing dinner with a breathtaking view of Manhattan .  The cons to the restaurant in my opinion was the pricing which I thought was a tad bit overpriced but the food is definitely worth it.  Also we made reservations for 8:30 and didn't get seated till almost 9:10 but again the food is worth the wait.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

311,OGOtxYWWDaLEkts4UPxKEg,Ron M.,3.0 star rating,"I'm always skeptical of high end restaurant chains, namely because good ones are very hard to run.  The rule is that once you start branching out, the quality will go down.Ruth's Chris Steak House was no exception to this.  Obviously, this place serves a solid piece of meat, has good service and fancy shmancy decor & ambiance.  However, for the price level and desired reputation that this place strives for, the food and drinks could have all been a few notches better. I feel that with these chains, since they've already developed some name for themselves, they don't use as much heart to make the food.  The steak and potatoes that I ordered, for example, were covered in way too much spices, salts, oils and butter.  Personally, I appreciate the flavor of the core dish and don't like when restaurants and chefs try to cover up that core with all sorts of seasoning (especially fatty ones). Overall, I had a good time here, but I left trying to forget the food I just ate.  I'm probably not going to suggest coming here again, but if someone else invites us I might go just to give it another shot, and, hopefully, have a better impression.",Ruth’s Chris Steak House,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, Seafood,, American, (Traditional)"

The staff at this location is very friendly and accommodating. Both times I made my review via opentable and added a note about it being my bf's bday. At our table, they would leave a bday note and confetti, which I thought was really sweet. This year I also had brought in my own cake and they had no issues taking it to the back, cutting it, serving it to our party (after they first presented the whole cake to the celebrant with candles lit). We had a large party of 16 this year, whereas last year it was just the 2 of us. But both times, everyone enjoyed their food. Our friends ordered Steak (of course), Chicken, and Fish along with numerous sides and I heard nothing but good things and saw clean plates.

I went for someone's birthday dinner and we brought our own cake and after our meal, they brought it out with candles and everything was just perfect. No embarassing ""Happy Birthday"" song for the birthday girl, either!In terms of the food, I think it's very good. Two of the diners had filet which was cooked medium well. The steaks came out medium well just like they were supposed to. I ordered garlic crusted halibut, but they had run out of the halibut, so they made the same dish with bass. It was phenomenal! So delicious, and again, Melissa was very quick to jump in with another white fish recommendation because she knew the halibut was out. The piece of fish, by the way, was HUGE. So delicious. All of Ruth's Chris' entrees come out on a sizzling porcelain dish so please be careful!For sides, we got the sauteed string beans with whole roasted garlic, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The string beans were nice and crunchy. Luckily they were not overcooked and with the soft roasted garlic cloves, this side dish was superb. The mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were both very good as well. We were a bit disappointed to learn, however, that they no longer serve the steak frites. Our waitress informed us that certain less popular menu items were being cut from the menu.We also ordered a bottle of Riesling and got a cocktail called ""Nuts and Berries"". If you're into creamy, milky type cocktails, this is a must-order.Lastly, Ruth's Chris has a summer dinner special menu which I think is an excellent deal. Our entire party ordered off this menu and honestly, there was a lot of variety and the options were much less limited than at other dining establishments. There were probably 8 different entrees to choose from. That's expansive for a pre-fixe menu! Depending on your entree, you can get a starter salad or soup, entree, side and dessert for either ~$40 or ~$48. Awesome deal.I had a fantastic time here.

324,cqQxvnqZ_sOkeCQhfMI2UQ,Lindzie T.,3.0 star rating,"This is one of my least favorite Ruth's Chris'. The chain is a favorite of the family's and I've frequented many locations. (Manhattan - Midtown West, Westchester, Newington, CT, Chicago, Savannah, GA, Dallas, Wilkes-Barre, PA) The food was good, but the atmosphere and the staff were just okay. The waiters and busboys were permanently gathered around the corner from our table (the hallway that leeds to the bar and restrooms, etc.) and were talking loudly. It was the afternoon, so there wasn't really a romantic vibe going on, but it was still kind of annoying. Probably the worst thing about this particular location is how crowded the tables seem to be and how they are arranged. We were seated in a small section with just one other table that was very close. We were a group of six, with two teenagers and a baby and I was concerned the whole time that we were bothering the table of two sitting three feet from us that were probably trying to have a nice relaxing meal. The food was good, but could have been better. As usual, I had the stuffed chicken breast, which is always fantastic! The Au Gratin Potatoes were a little watery, not the best I've ever had. The creamed spinach was extremely greasy and not as creamy as it should be. For dessert, the chocolate flourless cake didn't disappoint. Overall, the food was good, but I expect perfection when paying top dollar! Also, the view is not that amazing.

Easy to get to off of 495. Valet parking and lovely view of the city. Unfortunately due to the rain we couldn't enjoy an after dinner stroll. Merp. The waiter was so polished and very knowledgeable of the wine. Of course we had to holla at a bottle. It was a blend, who knew that was a thing? (I'm more of a craft beer aficionado, but wine does make me all happy on the inside esp at 13.5% abv) He had the filet mignon, medium. Ahh steakhouses w/ their heavenly chefs cooking up art. Moist, flavorful, and so buttery. (Mo' butter mo' better) I had the salmon, crisp on the outside and flakey inside. Shared creamed spinach and mashed potatoes both of which oozed culinary swag. Def a special occasion place for me as I cud see it getting pricey (although there were moms w/ their young kids, but I guess everyone's budget is dif) Still, such a lovely, slow paced dinner. Our table overlooking the view of the river. Perfect lighting. I was surprised at how large the restaurant was and their bar. I'm intrigued to return to try their cocktails. Oh n they have billiards right next door which would be fun afterwards. The only thing I could've asked for is larger portions so I cud take leftovers, but we took home dessert.

Although the (somewhat expensive, a la carte) menu includes fresh seafood, chicken, and pork, I've never had anything there except for filet mignon. The steak arrives sizzling with butter, perfectly prepared, and in giant proportions. The sides complement the steak, and the wine selection is good.
