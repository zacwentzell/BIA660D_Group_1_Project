0,Ox6NXoHS5rFQ3FA_-oKdaQ,Christina B.,4.0 star rating,"Otto Strada is one of the better Italian restaurants in Hoboken. Unlike Cafe Michelina which has an old school style, Otto Strada has a modern twist - and pizza. Similar to the other Italian restaurants in the area, it's BYOB so bring a bottle of wine or two. We tried the burrata, two pastas and two pizzas. The smashed burrata is a must try. The pastas were notably better than the pizza, but the pizza wasn't bad either. All the entrees are pretty large so be prepared for leftovers unless you're sharing.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I love a fudgy brownie but this brownie was literally like a hunk of fudge with very very sweet icing.  Didn't taste the Nutella... not worth the calories or money. I would try this place again but skip dessert... and if the nats are still a problem I'll prob never go back.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
3,_PeZgqt5NfKSbY4zYNJ2rQ,Melissa M.,4.0 star rating,"I had been dying to try Otto Strada ever since moving to Hoboken a few months ago, and I will definitely be returning!They definitely have a variety of dishes on their menu- I decided to go with a carbonara pasta and my friend ordered the bistecca alla pizzaiola (ribeye steak in red sauce). Although the steak was good, I feel that you really cannot go wrong with their pasta dishes. Coming from an Italian family that frequently makes homemade pasta, my standards are high. The buccatini alla carbonara passed the test. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the pancetta added a great flavor to the cream sauce. I will definitely be ordering this again when I return! The portions were large so I had leftovers for the next day.For dessert, we tried the pear robiola pizza. It wasn't terrible, but was sort of bland. I wouldn't order it again, especially for $16.I went to Otto Strada in December, so I obviously sat inside, but I'd like to go back in the spring when I can enjoy the outdoor seating. The fact that they are BYOB is also great because it is not a cheap dinner.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Two minutes after sitting down the waiter accidentally spilled scampi sauce down my back. He was very apologetic and came right over with seltzer water. The restaurant is tiny and jammed packed. When our actual waiter came over he seemed annoyed with us and did not tell us the specials. We placed our order and he came back to tell us they were out of eggplant pizza.  Instead we tried the veggie pie, gluten free pasta and a bunch of appetizers. The waiter could not seem to figure out how to serve the food and was annoyed with us when we asked for napkins or larger plates. The restaurant was not wildly busy and we asked politely. He then came out with the pizza and pasta and it was it was not gluten free. After asking and waiting the bill finally came and not a thing was comped they didn't even offer a dessert. Tomato and mozz were very thick slices and not good for sharing. Next came the shrimp. $18 for 6 grilled shrimp seems a big much. Pizza was good but nothing great. Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower and zucchini. Our favorite was the grilled corn. Restaurant was very cute, nice outdoor seating, byob and seems to have a good menu.

The waiter was attentive to all of our needs and even helped us with suggestions on what to have. I would suggest simplifying the menu. It is massive and has WAY too many options. We ordered the meatball appetizers and the cheese plate (3 cheeses for $12). The portions were massive. It was great. The meatball was flavorful and had a good texture. The sauce was tangy and delicious.We tried the parmesan, burrata and goat cheese and all were phenomenal. We probably shoulda ordered the appetizer with the different jams but that is our mistake.Finally we had the nutella pizza with strawberries and bananas.

Tucked away from Washington Street, this restaurant is a hidden gem perfect for a date or a night out with family/friends.

15,mbxdo8Z59tcQc_FJMxHNeA,Trent T.,5.0 star rating,"Otto Strada is an awesome little hidden gem tucked away in Hoboken. My brother lives in the area and has told us multiple times about this place and we finally got around to coming in. The restaurant is very small inside and can feel a little tight, but their food makes up for it.Started with the octopus, salami verde, and the sausage and broccoli rabe. If you're hesitant to try octopus, don't be. It was amazingly tender and had great flavor and texture. The salami verde had a nice variety and was extremely fresh. The sausage was some of the best sausage I have ever had in my life, with the broccoli rabe following nicely right behind. For my main dish I went with the eggplant as I saw the pictures and had to taste to compare to my mothers. It was layers upon layers of delicious fried eggplant on a bed of red sauce covered with a sheet of mozzarella. It was definitely a nice sized portion and definitely quite delicious.To wrap things up for dessert we tried the cannoli calzone and the cannoli cones. The cannoli calzone was Huge and had some excellent flavor. I would have to give the upper hand to the cannoli cones, awesome flavor with a great crunch from the cone.Overall, I always love a great byob and Otto Strada was no exception. This place delivered every step of the way, highly recommended.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

17,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"How has this place escaped me for so long? Hoboken seems to be filled with a bunch of ho-hum Italian places that in no way distinguish themselves from one another. Otto Strada easily separates themselves from the pack and a massive menu that is both traditional and creative, while being restrained. We showed up on a Friday night, and expectedly were told they were all filled up there would be a 45 minute wait. They don't take reservations here, so either show up early or expect a bit of a wait on weekend nights. About 30 minutes later, we got a call to let us know our table was ready. We opted for the drunken octopus, crostini, pasta carbonara and the one pound meatball. The drunken octopus was fantastic, and a massive portion with three large tentacles, and a side of cannelloni beans and tomatoes. This could easily be an entree. The octopus is tender and delicious, and as good as octopus I've had anywhere. The crostini we opted for included creamy buratta cheese, caramelized tomatoes, and honey. The sweetness coaxed out of the caramelized tomatoes pairs perfectly with the honey, but is successfully tempered down by the sprinkling of sea salt, basil, and olive oil. Also to note... The bread on the crostini is softer / less toasted than you might expect, so while the contrasting textures are missing, the flavors more than make up for it. The carbonara normally comes with pasta that is not made in house, but they happily substituted it for an in house made linguini. This was so creamy and delicious. Really just an excellent pasta dish, and again, the portions is more than large enough to share or be a single standalone entree. What goes better with a giant plate of pasta than a giant meatball? The one pound meatball is larger than a softball and comes smothered in tomato sauce and topped with a healthy dollop of fresh and creamy ricotta. It goes without says, this is another giant dish. The meatball itself is fine; not as impressive as the other dishes, but certainly not bad. This is the only dish I probably wouldn't order again. While the prices here feel a bit on the higher side for both Hoboken, and for an Italian place, the large portions and quality of the food easily justify the prices. Don't believe me? The wait for a table on any weekend night should help convince you. This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a while, and oh yeah, it's BYOB. Absolutely coming back soon.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

35,mbxdo8Z59tcQc_FJMxHNeA,Trent T.,5.0 star rating,"Otto Strada is an awesome little hidden gem tucked away in Hoboken. My brother lives in the area and has told us multiple times about this place and we finally got around to coming in. The restaurant is very small inside and can feel a little tight, but their food makes up for it.Started with the octopus, salami verde, and the sausage and broccoli rabe. If you're hesitant to try octopus, don't be. It was amazingly tender and had great flavor and texture. The salami verde had a nice variety and was extremely fresh. The sausage was some of the best sausage I have ever had in my life, with the broccoli rabe following nicely right behind. For my main dish I went with the eggplant as I saw the pictures and had to taste to compare to my mothers. It was layers upon layers of delicious fried eggplant on a bed of red sauce covered with a sheet of mozzarella. It was definitely a nice sized portion and definitely quite delicious.To wrap things up for dessert we tried the cannoli calzone and the cannoli cones. The cannoli calzone was Huge and had some excellent flavor. I would have to give the upper hand to the cannoli cones, awesome flavor with a great crunch from the cone.Overall, I always love a great byob and Otto Strada was no exception. This place delivered every step of the way, highly recommended.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

37,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"How has this place escaped me for so long? Hoboken seems to be filled with a bunch of ho-hum Italian places that in no way distinguish themselves from one another. Otto Strada easily separates themselves from the pack and a massive menu that is both traditional and creative, while being restrained. We showed up on a Friday night, and expectedly were told they were all filled up there would be a 45 minute wait. They don't take reservations here, so either show up early or expect a bit of a wait on weekend nights. About 30 minutes later, we got a call to let us know our table was ready. We opted for the drunken octopus, crostini, pasta carbonara and the one pound meatball. The drunken octopus was fantastic, and a massive portion with three large tentacles, and a side of cannelloni beans and tomatoes. This could easily be an entree. The octopus is tender and delicious, and as good as octopus I've had anywhere. The crostini we opted for included creamy buratta cheese, caramelized tomatoes, and honey. The sweetness coaxed out of the caramelized tomatoes pairs perfectly with the honey, but is successfully tempered down by the sprinkling of sea salt, basil, and olive oil. Also to note... The bread on the crostini is softer / less toasted than you might expect, so while the contrasting textures are missing, the flavors more than make up for it. The carbonara normally comes with pasta that is not made in house, but they happily substituted it for an in house made linguini. This was so creamy and delicious. Really just an excellent pasta dish, and again, the portions is more than large enough to share or be a single standalone entree. What goes better with a giant plate of pasta than a giant meatball? The one pound meatball is larger than a softball and comes smothered in tomato sauce and topped with a healthy dollop of fresh and creamy ricotta. It goes without says, this is another giant dish. The meatball itself is fine; not as impressive as the other dishes, but certainly not bad. This is the only dish I probably wouldn't order again. While the prices here feel a bit on the higher side for both Hoboken, and for an Italian place, the large portions and quality of the food easily justify the prices. Don't believe me? The wait for a table on any weekend night should help convince you. This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a while, and oh yeah, it's BYOB.

47,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,2.0 star rating,"Went for DinnerFood - 1/5. I was told many good things about Otto Strada and there is a chance it might have been a fluke but that doesn't change the fact that the food I got tasted bad. The focaccia bread they start you with is very small, hard and heavy on oil. This had me a bit surprised to have such below average bread at an Italian restaurant I heard praises for but I still had high hopes for the pasta, as the ingredients sounded like a good combination. Perhaps in theory the Capellini con Pancetta, Cavolini e Funghi would make a beautiful balance of flavors but the one I ate at Otto was tasteless. Firstly the bacon (not pancetta as advertised on menu) was soggy and bland. Bacon's charm comes from a crispy salty goodness so having what tasted like boiled bacon with all it's salt extracted from it was very disappointing. The mushrooms and brussels sprouts had similar issues as none of the items had a good sear to have a strong flavor profile. The pasta was also under-seasoned and the entire dish lacked any flavor. At first I thought the liquid at the bottom of the plate was a sauce, but it tasted like the water that comes out from cooking mushrooms and pasta water from when the angel hair was transferred onto the plate. Very disappointed in the food.Service - 2/5. Slow and inattentive. It was a busy restaurant but every time I looked around for the waitress, she was chatting excessively with another table or her co-workers. It is not like I think the front of the house staff should have no fun, but if there is work to be done more professionalism is expected. Waiting to place my food order, get the check and pay for the check took extra long due to how little the waitress seemed to pay attention to tables she isn't currently conversing with.Value - 1/5. The prices aren't bad for dinner with pasta being in the 18 to 22 dollar range for dinner in Hoboken. The food tasted awful though and the service wasn't good so spending money at this restaurant was not a enjoyable experience.

Perfectly complemented with the side of bean, tomato and onion salad. Salmon is by far one of the best I've ever had. Cooked on a cedar plank and glazed with a brown sugar Dijon mustard that gives the right salty/sweet combo. Sampled the pork chop parm (huge and delicious), chicken millenese (phenomenal) and the limoncello chicken (too lemony/sweet for my taste).

We had olives (fine of course), a fennel salad which was overpriced for what you got, and the fig/prosciutto/balsamic/honey pizza. Let me preface this by saying I work in the food service industry in a high end restaurant in the city and I never ever send food back. I took two bites and returned the pizza. It was covered/soaked in honey. It actually tasted like it should've been a dessert it was sooooo sweet. The waitress actually said something about the chef making a mistake on how sweet it was. Not a big deal they took it off our check and bought us a desert which was super nice. Round two. I stayed away from the pizza and ordered the lemon chicken and we split the spinach salad to start. Salad was great and a big portion. Then the chicken came which was again wildly sweet. My friend said her carbonara was nothing to write home about and just a 'pasta in cream sauce for $19'. My boyfriend had cavatelli with lamb sausage and he said the whole dish tasted watery as if they didn't strain the pasta before adding it to the sauce or something. I finished the chicken and we all decided we would never return. The atmosphere is cute and trendy. Love that it's BYOB. But the food is just off? And rather disappointing.

I had the eggplant parm which was stacked high with a blanket of fresh mozz. Best egg parm I've ever had. My girlfriend had the beef and veal tortellini with a cream sauce and balsamic reduction. Was fabulous. I can't wait to go back. Service was very accommodating as well, we had to wait so they chilled our bottle of wine inside until we were seated.

We also had the shrimp appetizer - very good. For my meal I had the carbonara which was not too heavy as this can be a heavier dish. The sauce was thin enough, and the pasta so fresh. In our group we had the seafood cioppino, one pound meatball and vegetable pasta. All amazing! And the price was perfect, especially because we had 2 bottles of our byob wine.

HOWEVER, I've never been more disrespected by a waiter in my entire life. Our waiter came by our table 4 times all night (we were there for 2 hours), and when he came by he was running away. Our food was cold and we could not even send it back bc WE NEVER SAW THE WAITER. At the end of the night when we were given our bill, our waiter vanished! I had to bring the bill inside to the manager, who was very polite and rightfully took some items off our bill. When I explained to the manager my issues with the waiter, the waiter came over and proceeded to berate me and essentially call me a liar. He gave a few sarcastic apologies but continued to say that I (the customer) was wrong and that he was constantly at our table. He was insanely rude and lost a customer forever because of this.

When we showed up, there were plenty of tables available so we were seated immediately - which was great.We saw the waitress maybe three times for the remainder of brunch - once when she greeted us and handed us our menus, once when she brought out our food and once when she brought the bill. We all wanted refills on our waters/coffees but she never returned to the table to ask how we were doing and the busser did not understand English so it took us getting up to ask her to get what we needed.

Smoked bacon, brussels, criminis, rosemary, romano. But, something was missing. It was surprisingly bland. Womp womp. I heard the same about the 16oz meatball. Just a big ol flavorless hunk o meat in a cute lil cast iron. Another shared 'meh' sentiment was for the tortellini stuffed with braised veal + beef. I did have a lovely bite of the pollo limoncello.

It's also a great spot for dinner or brunch with friends and family, and it's my mom's favorite place to order in from (yes, they deliver!). No matter who I go/order with, what always sticks out to me (besides the delicious food, but more on that soon) is that the servers and staff are always super friendly,  accommodating (my mother is a bit of a food snob and can be a little bit difficult with her requests), and personable, which I find really adds to the charm of the place. The food is awesome as well. I'm a creature of habit, so when I find something I like, I generally stick to it, and while I love my go-to meal, must admit that I have liked pretty much everything I have sampled off of my boyfriend's/friends'/mom's plates. That said, I highly recommend the caprese salad (yeah, I know, typical for Italian restaurants, but I'm a big fan of their balsamic glaze, and the tomatoes are huge), the eggplant crostini, and the bucatini alla carbonara (as long as you're not counting calories -this dish is seriously rich & creamy & so delicious). If you're opting for pizza, the classic margherita is an easy choice, but the sweet sausage and fontina pie is also a great choice. Dessert? Cannoli cones, no contest. Cannoli cream, semi-sweet chocolate chips, raspberry sauce and pistachios in a sugar cone?! The combination of the sweetness of the cannoli cream and the raspberry with the slight bitterness of the semi-sweet chips and saltiness of the pistachios is a dream. Seriously, I hoard these things for late night snacks. For brunch, I always go for sweet over savory, so I love the panettone French toast (huge portion, fantastic flavor, and the mascarpone is a nice touch to balance out the sweetness).As far as other menu items go, I've been told that the bistecca alla pizzaiola is a winner, so I plan on forcing someone (sorry, boyfriend!) to order that sometime soon so I can order the bucatini but also bites of the steak. The only thing I have tried that I was not partial to was the limoncello chicken (I found it to be too limoncello-y and sweet- could just be a result of drinking too much limoncello in my younger days and not being able to handle it on food). Minus one star for consistency - unfortunately, while the food is generally delicious, I've noticed variations in portion sizes and flavor of my favorite menu items. As a regular, I know the quality this place is capable of producing, so I would prefer to not have different sized portions or flavor additions to/removals from my meal every few times that I order. Given some of the negative reviews from first timers for this restaurant, I felt like this was worth mentioning, because consistency is key in building a customer base.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

The ingredients are fresh and the dishes are well thought out and come together very nicely. I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. Another plus is it is BYOB and no cork fee so that makes this place even more appealing. Last time I came here, my boyfriend and I wanted a somewhat romantic evening so we walked by and was told there is about a 30min wait. The place was packed!! (Only drawback, they DO NOT take reservations, at all) We put our name and number down and walked to a nearby bar to have a drink and watch a basketball game. About 20mins later our table was ready. Right away a pitcher of water was brought over and our bottle of wine opened and we thoroughly looked at the menu. I don't usually order an appetizer but the BF had a good week at work and was feeling extra hungry so he ordered the Gambero Cotto a Legna, perfectly baked butterflied shrimp with just lemon and herbs. I chose the Pappardelle con Pomodori Spinaci e Burrata with homemade pasta and for the BF's entire he went with the Capellini con Pancetta Cavolini e Funghi. Both dishes were well seasoned and tasted amazing. The portions were great also, I didn't feel overwhelmed or leave wanting more.As for the service, I thought everything happened very smoothly.

But in Hoboken, it's perfect for an intimate meal in an area that's not overpopulated with the usual Friday crowd. My roommate suggested it for an impromptu girls night. BYOB, AWESOME. We DID have to wait 40 minutes for a table, so off to Finnegan's we went for a glass of wine (right around the corner) and it was painless. We started with the cheese plate on the specials menu, which was phenomenal. My roommate and I love cheeses - the stinkier the better - so it was an no-brainer, and for $20 it was well worth it for a hefty piece and a half of bleu cheese with Gorgonzola crumbled on top (cheese on cheese on cheese!), fresh mozzarella & tomato, parmigiana reggiano drizzled in balsamic, and some stinky slab of unidentifiable cheese that was ridiculously good. We also pigged out on the buratta crostini, as I'm a sucker for a good buratta. And boy, was it good. Fresh and light, drizzled in honey and absolutely perfect. We went with pastas for our main dishes, she the gnocchi and me and orrechette with sausage and broccoli rabbe, my go-to. The gnocchi was great. Dense, but not paste-y in your mouth or belly. She was disappointed in the red sauce, just because there was SO much of it and she's not a huge red sauce person, and the menu promised saffron in the gnocchi (which I did taste a hint of). My pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. A light olive oil and mild hint of heat in the sausage, mmmmmmm! Awesome. I really hope this place gets better reviews soon, because I fully endorse it.

The delivery took 70-80 minutes which is long and I paid 43 dollars for a pasta and an appetizer and there bread that was provided was not interesting nor did they provide butter or olive oil or cutlery / napkins...those are the negatives which made this place three stars instead of four. However the main dishes were very good and interesting. For 18 dollars I had a and olive oil and burrata sampler with four types of olive oil and four dollops of fresh burrata. They were excellent especially the chili which was outstanding for its kick. The crostini provided was also very good. Although expensive it is a large appetizer and could easily be shared by 3 to 4 people although more crostini would be needed. I also ordered bucatin carbonara. This was more like a cacio e pepe but it was very well done. The pancetta and pasta and sauce were very tasty. I don't love bucatini because it's a thicker noodle so would have preferred spaghetti or even penne but this was still a good dish. Because of the way they prepare these dishes I will definitely try other parts of their menu including the pizzas or secondis. I ordered their Porco Picante (san marzano tomatoes, homemade mozzarella, pepperoni, hot sausage, hot Italian peppers, chili oil, ricotta salata, fresh basil and evoo) - it was delicious and spicy!

140,gUZm3Dt8EL7Flua6tLthOw,Tom C.,2.0 star rating,"Very disappointed. Heard great things about this place but from food to service the whole experience was mediocre. For appetizers, we ordered the kale salad and a sausage and peppers plate. The sausage and peppers were good, but it was presented In deconstructed way with three separate piles of sausage, peppers and broccoli rabe. Weird. Tasty, but weird - it needed some starch, like crostinis or something.  The kale salad was terrible. Completely over dressed and it included almost half a bulb of garlic in it. I accidentally ate an entire piece of garlic because I mistook it for a crouton. The salad was basically inedible. On to mains....The gnocchi was overcooked and also pretty inedible; like glutinous bricks.  The tomato sauce tasted canned. The tortolacci was rubbery and under seasoned. The cream sauce for the tortolacci was sweet and didn't really match the flavor profile of the rest of the dish. There was also way too much of it on the plate, that dish probably has about 1,000 calories of heavy cream in it. Service is what you typically get in Hoboken (e.g terrible). Had to pour our own water and wine thought the meal and flag down the waitress to get some Parmesan and a new fork and knife when the busser took our flatware away with the appetizers, which took forever since she was also busy answering phones and emptying the coffee maker.  She was tipped accordingly. I probably won't be back. I've come to expect mediocre food in Hoboken and was hoping this would be something on par with the better spots in town, like Anthony David, but it's not. It's just another hyped up place filled with 23 year olds glad to have another BYOB joint who wouldn't know how good food is supposed to taste.Maybe the pizzas are better but I'm not going out of my way to try.

The eggplant parm was lukewarm and soggy...I hardly ate any of it, ugh. My guy had the chicken milanese and while I normally always try his dishes, I took his word for it when he said it was just ok.

My girlfriend had it this time and ate every last bite [which she never does]. Recently we took my mother there for her birthday. Once again it lived up to the hype. We did cured meats and cheeses for the app. I had the seafood stew. Unbelievable. The other two entrees were, again, PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA and BRACIOLA DI MAIALE ""PORK CHOP"" ALLA PARMIGIANA.

148,qwThIs1W4NyUWrXoDeF3dw,Molly B.,1.0 star rating,"Wow. I've been to this restaurant many times and have always been frustrated with the management of the wait times, however this experience was beyond ridiculous. We waited for a table for way longer than expected, after receiving extremely rude service from the hostess. Then, a very nice waiter came out and let us know that a table would be ready soon and he would come get us. He returned within a minute or so and took us right to a nice table inside. However, two minutes later he came back and very apologetically says that he sat us by mistake and that another party of 5 was ahead of us. We were very confused. Then the manager came up and basically told us to get up, extremely unapologetically... I've worked in the restaurant industry and understand the stress. However, when you seat a party after they've been waiting for longer than advised in the ridiculous humidity, you keep them there. So your waiter made a mistake, he's busy and was trying to provide nice service. Your horrible hostess (who made rude comments to everyone in reach of hearing) should have done her job and been managing the seating. Next time something like this happens you a.) Offer the party you sat mistakenly your sincerest apologies and perhaps a comped appetizer (considering its BYOB) or b.) Don't say anything to the party you say mistakenly and let the other party know that you're extremely sorry for the longer than expected wait and offer them a comped appetizer.

I had the breaded chicken and it hit the spot. My friend had the eggplant and she loved her dish as well. After dinner we had dessert - the strawberry cheesecake. That was good also, except I had one small issue: the strawberries were still kinda frozen when I bit into them. Fresh strawberries would have been better. A minor issue.

This pattern repeated throughout the night and in a place that's 500 sq. ft at best, that's not an excuse. The gnocchi that I ordered were not worth the $18 and were overpowered by heavy meat sauce and some spices I could not figure out. We saved some room for dessert because when dining Italian, dessert is a necessity. We opted for a chocolate fondant ganache cake because it was one of the only items on the menu under $10.

Went on a Wednesday night, and aside from one other table of two, the entire restaurant was dominated by a party of about 15 people (friends of the owner??). The BF and I are not picky eaters at all, and enjoy all types of food, especially Italian.  My complaint with this place was not so much the food as it was the terrible service!!! There was ONE WAITER for the entire place, including the table of 15. They were constantly at him to bring this or that, and he basically ignored our table for the entire time we were there- to the point where we had cold, eaten food waiting to be cleared from the table for over 15 minutes, drinks that needed filling, and I'm basically staring what looked like a manager down, and again, they did nothing but ignore us. We aren't needy customers- I don't need you to come over 5000 times and ask how things are- we really need the minimum of attention. But please, when we order appetizers, mains, etc...bring them in a reasonable amount of time, and clear them as well! The sad part is, I think the owner was at the party of 15 and he couldn't have cared less when we looked clearly annoyed- he was too busy demanding wine for him and his friends- glad they got good service!

154,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,3.0 star rating,"New Italian place in town, I'm all in! The wife and I went  on a Friday night to check out the new kid on the block. The place is small and kinda your typical new Hoboken restaurant, exposed brick, reclaimed wood and subway tile. Not a negative just an observation. The place is small only about 10-12 tables mostly 2 tops they push together for larger parties. Like many restaurants in town you are sitting on top of other guests and having to move your table so people can get in. No biggie, it's the norm.For whatever reason this place is obscenely loud for a small place. I mean it has the acoustics of you singing in your shower.  This is a perfect place for 25 year old girls to drink wine and yell so be ready for that. We could barely hear over everyone else trying to talk over each other. So don't come here for a nice calm and romantic evening.On to the food. I will say everything on the menu sounds pretty good. We started with the crostini and it was delicious, actually my favorite part of the meal. There were 5 solid pieces that were just absolutely fantastic and full of flavor so after that we waited for entrees in excitement, alas not to be. I ordered the giant meatball with ricotta cheese and wife got carbonara. The meatball is literally just that a giant meat ball served on a cast iron skillet in red sauce with a few pieces of bread around it.  Add some pasta or something. The meatball itself was really just kinda ""meh"". To be honest it was disappointing it was kind of bland and in reality I've had a lot better. I watched the lasagna and some other dishes come out and I wish I would have gotten those. The sauce was good, it was the star of the dish which it shouldn't be. The ""ball"" just lacked true flavor.  The lady's was kinda bland for a carbonara, it definitely needed more seasoning or something it was also ""meh"" she didn't like it that much. None of it was the point of sending back we ate it all but neither of us would order those dishes again. For desert we got the chocolate cake, this was also just average, it tasted no different than a chocolate cake from shop rite. Tasty but just nothing that was over the top exciting. We should have gotten cheesecake or a cannoli.Overall the service was ok and food came out in a pretty reasonably time frame. It's also BYOB, which is a plus. Probably the most disappointing thing for us were the kale chips. It's an Italian restaurant, give me some bread, butter and olive oil! I'm half Sicilian and these are staples at every other joint and family table I guess maybe it's trendy or healthy. But let's be real, Italian food isn't health food. It's carbs, straight up lots of carbs. The kale chips were just so boring and I was so excited that there was bread on my meatball. If you're into rabbit food then you'll be thrilled.Overall, a straight average Italian place. Will I be back?

155,5Tl4ap-ZxYztBCCEsQGTEw,Andrew R.,2.0 star rating,"This new BYO Italian in Hoboken is very average.The decor is very nice, but they need to do something about the acoustics. With hard surfaces on floor, walls and ceiling, the noise level requires shouting to carry on conversation during dinner.As for the food, I was hoping for better. I ordered the ""Pork Chop"" parm. It was overcooked yet somehow served cold not to mention tough. They must cook it first and then fry it just before serving. It probably sat and got cold between steps. They need to figure out how to do this dish right, or drop it from the menu. I should have sent it back.My dinner companions all pronounced their dishes ""ok"" and ""fine"". Nobody said ""this dish is awesome"".Also, we all expect some bread and olive oil in an Italian restaurant. Is this a cost cutting measure?

We went on the second night they were open, and i""m sure they're still working out kinks.  I'll definitely update when we go again.Overall, I'm very happy to see this place open - it's nice to have a casual BYO option in the center of town.  We're always looking for a quick bite near home and are getting tired of Clinton Social.The food was good - not over the top, but solid and comfortable.  Pretty much what you'd expect to get from mom on a trip home - lol.  We started with the salsiccia which we very much enjoyed.  In fact, I enjoy the combo of broccoli rabe and sausage so much, I went with it again for dinner in the pasta dish.  It was more successful as an appetizer - I thought it was a bit bland in the pasta and needed some form of sauce.  My husband had the carbonara which was really very good.  Portion sizes were nice as well - not overwhelming.  We finished our plates and were perfectly satisfied.I liked the atmosphere overall, it's nicely decorated and the exposed brick wall is really nice. I did not like that they had the lights turned all the way up - it was so bright and lost all atmosphere. Note to restaurateurs - the easiest way to make your place feel cozy and intimate is to just lower the lights.Also, the NOISE. OMG.  There were only us and two other tables in there and it was SO LOUD I couldn't even think.  To be fair, one of the parties was loud and drunk and totally over the top, but still, there is nothing in the restaurant to absorb sound - no curtains, ceiling panels, nothing.  They really need to address that.Anyway, I wish this place well and hope they can work out the kinks - I think it's just what the area needs - a comfortable, casual place to go when you don't want to cook. I hope to give them a few weeks and try again!",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

It was good, but I wouldn't get it again.  Second course - meatball.  Really good sauce and was nice for leftovers the next day. Third course - Crispy prosciutto pizza and cioppino.  The pizza was really good, thin and flavorful.  The cioppino was fine.  I wouldn't order it again because I really want to try some of the homemade pasta.  Dessert - nutella calzone. This was so good and rich with nutella and mascarpone cheese.  We each took two pieces of pizza home and a good portions of the meatball and dessert. I had enough for lunch and dinner the next day and dessert twice.  I believe our bill was $80 before tip and we really did over order.After we ordered, the server asked if we would move tables to accommodate a large group that was really cramped at one of the tables.  They were so nice about it, we were happy to oblige.  They even gave us a dessert, which we never would have ordered, but it was delicious.I've heard some restaurants in Hoboken rush you out or give you not so subtle hints that they have people waiting and want you to leave.  We never felt that way at Otto Strada and we were there for a long time.  The manager and other servers thanked us for moving tables and I would give overall service 4.5 stars.  Looking forward to going back soon!  Big plus for BYOB which helps keep the bill down.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

This was surprising as all our other dishes were just amazing!2) Both times I went our water pitcher ran out (and it wasn't refilled)...think the place would run much smoother IMHO if they had a bus boy. 3) The music....the decor doesn't match the music (Top 40 hits?)...Perhaps a Gotan Project or something of that sort might match the ambiance a bit more?4) This isn't a Meh comment but...can you add a crab cake dish to the menu?

We came around 9:30 on a Saturday night and had to wait about a half hour for a table to open up - this place is small, so I would recommend reservations. The hostess was very accommodating, and thanked us for waiting. The service from there was another story, however. Our waiter came over right away and gave us our menus and specials. We decided pretty quickly what we wanted, and then waited...and waited..and waited. We watched him go over to pretty much every other table, chatting and checking in with them. When we finally caught our attention, he said ""Oh sorry, forgot about you guys"". I'm generally pretty understanding, especially when it's the end of the night, but the place is so small that I don't understand HOW you can forget about us. Once we placed our order, our food was out quickly. The margarita pizza was good to start, and I was intrigued by the giant meatball with meat from their neighbor and local butcher Truglio's. The meatball was good, but nothing spectacular. It was lacking a little in flavor. My fiance thought his chicken milanese was average. We finished off the night with gelato, and were relieved to get out with a bill under $60 (BYOB, BTW).I think this place has potential and a menu (albeit on the small side, but I don't think that's an issue) to set themselves apart from other Italian restaurants in town. It's nice to see dishes other than the standard chicken parm or penne vodka on a menu. If they can step up the service and really perfect their dishes, they'll do very well.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We got a table,  seated & ordered 4 appetisers.  They were delicious. I got a salad (goats cheese walnuts yum!) And others got sliders & crostinis (2 different types). All delicious!!! Main course I think I could have skipped. The two men got steaks but it was drowned in tomato based sauce they felt overpowered the beauty of the big steak. It would have been better recieved if the steak was plain and had a mini jug with sauce in it on the side. My friend got the lobster gnocchi and it was good. I got basic spaghetti bolongese. The meat was delicious and tender melt in mouth. My only critique would be less pasta and not the ribbon wide width. It's too heavy! And then onto dessert. Tirimisu  (would prefer the Italian style with cocoa & mascapone) was good - almond base & the brownie fudge was so heavy but good! We got 2 between the 4 of us! Overall it cost us 50 dollars each (tip included) which was reasonable. The waiter was attentive and very pleasant. We spoke to the owner outside and he was a lovely man.

We're done after our latest experience. We ordered (1) pizza for delivery at 7:15 pm and were given a delivery estimate of 8:20-8:30. When the pizza hadn't arrived by 9 pm, we called to check in, and were told the delivery driver had left with our pizza ""5 minutes ago"". When it still hadn't arrived at 9:30 pm, we called again and were told again that the delivery driver had left with our pizza ""5 minutes ago"". We called again at 9:45 and were told the driver had ""just left"". When I asked why we had been told twice, both 45 minutes and then 15 minutes prior that our pizza was already on the way, I was informed that someone else who answered the phone must have told me, because the person who I was speaking to ""never would have told me that"". We spoke again at 10 pm and I was told the driver was still on the way -- we only live four blocks from the restaurant. Our (1) pizza, which we ordered at 7:15 pm, was delivered at 10:25 pm. Let me tell you, Otto Strada, when a customer calls multiple times to inquire about a pizza that was ordered 2-3 hours prior, an ""I'm sorry"" would really go a long way. We've had the experience multiple times prior when we've ordered over the phone for pickup, have arrived at the time we were told the pizza would be ready, to see our order handed over to the kitchen to be prepared.

Even though I was looking forward to trying a new Hoboken restaurant, I actually felt the whole experience was a bit underwhelming. All in all, it wasn't terrible and it wasn't great. My boyfriend and I decided to start off with the bruschetta -- a starter I always look forward to -- but was disappointed that it was overall very bland. Unseasoned, diced tomatoes and onions on hard bread -- definitely felt like it was missing some excitement! I asked for fresh shaven parmigiana to accompany the bruschetta and table bread and was surprised that it was jarred and not too fresh. For my meal, I ordered the pollo limoncello (without artichokes) and paired it with the asparagus instead of the fingerling potatoes. I did feel the limoncello gave the chicken a very unique, delicious taste. Was very refreshing and almost tingled on your tongue. The asparagus was also tasty but a bit mushy, as if it were drowning in olive oil. My boyfriend ordered the the steak pizzaiola. It was a unique concept, but just okay in taste. He would have preferred the steak paired with pasta instead of spinach. We decided to skip dessert, although the options did seem tasty but a bit expensive (around $10-$15). Our bill came to about $65 total - at least I was able to take some of the chicken home for lunch the next day and get two meals out of it!

The meatball I'd give an 8 outta 10. Real thick heavy rich red sauce and tender meatball. The polenta side was very disappointing. T was an exact round hockey puck side of polenta drowning in mushrooms, spinach and what looked like a butter sauce. (The menu just said ""polenta"". The waitress was great though and she gave us no issues returning it. But if they are going to put all those extra ingredients they should list them in the menu. Then the rabe appetizer. Well nothing about it was spicy. So much so that my husband who hates spice ate it. The ricotta salata was shredded not shaved. Big mistake since it's such a salty cheese and always shaved thin. Plus there was a big handful of it atop the broccoli rabe which really took away from the food. The sausage was sliced and symmetric as well as tasting like grocery store sausage as opposed to something more homey. I will say that the quality of products seemed pretty good (sausage aside) and the pizzas looked great on the table beside us.

Maybe it was the 5 min wait at the hostess's podium for the assumed owner to acknowledge us while she finished a phone call (considering it's a tiny place it's hard to not see the only people standing in the only walking aisle in the entire tiny restaurant) or the sense that everyone else who were seated after us seemed to be brought a basket of bread first. There was something not quite right for me. Our waiter was pleasant. He attempted to walk us through the night's specials and some portions of the menu but seemed too hurried to answer questions about additions of pasta to meat selections. My girlfriend had the OTTO STRADA'S POLPETTA DI NONNA (a gigantic beef meatball in marina sauce) with a side of linguine. I had a linguine dish with a cream sauce and thought it was pedestrian. We shared the INSALATA DI CAVOLO VERDE(A kale salad) which was fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the mango vinaigrette, although it did have the hint of something you could have made at home. I think that actually might sum up the entire dining experience for me. It all seemed like something I could have pulled together at home. Overall the experience was subpar for the pricing of a meal that requires matching between Insalata, Primi and Secondi. One benefit of doubt; we did not have a chance to experience their pizzas, so that might get us back into the building.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Food  was average, nothing special. Waiter was subpar. Although he was informative about the menu, he lacked attention.

205,s9k30wC47iXgPLQS3GGlfw,Nicole C.,3.0 star rating,"Pros: Food we had was delicious. We had a pizza, eggplant parm, & chocolate cake. Cons: my husband & I called ahead to make a last minute reservation  2 times. The first time we were told the restaurant was currently empty, and they could seat us as long as we were finished in 45 minutes. I was a little turned off by this & we went elsewhere (and finished in 45 minutes). The 2nd time we called @ 6pm we heard that same story about an empty restaurant,  but had a 2 hr window before we needed to be out. It wasn't only isolated to phone calls. .. While we were eating,  we overheard the hostess ask a couple, ""you'll be done by 8, right?"" I find the open time limits to eating very strange and unwelcoming. I think they should be able to manage tables/reservations without telling the diner the time constraint....other small restaurants in hoboken do it. Next, Kale chips instead of bread is different,  but we felt we needed to definitely get an appetizer as we waited for our food. Lastly, while the eggplant was delicious (melts in your mouth) I was surprised that there wasn't anything with it. It was swimming in sauce and almost begging for even a small helping of pasta. Food we had was great, but still think they need to fine tune some things. Really love having a new restaurant close to home...",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

The fresh mozzarella and the sauce were perfect and the eggplant was cooked just right. Shared a side of asparagus that tasted wonderful.Tonight I had the brasiole (sp) special and it was absolutely amazing. Both times I've been there we sat outside so I really can't comment on the noise level. We did sit right near the open door and I can honestly say that it really didn't seem loud inside and the place was full.The service was great. Our order was taken quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. Not too fast and certainly not too slow. The waiter was friendly and attentive and the owner made the rounds seeing to it that everyone was happy.Unlike most other Hoboken restaurants, Otto Strada is unpretentious and it's obvious that all of the energy is put into delivering quality food at a reasonable price.I don't get the 3 star rating because in my opinion, it's a definite 5 star place.It's a BYOB so the Frat House atmosphere that is so prevalent in many Hoboken restaurants isn't a factor. I'll be back again because as I watched the other people eating, I was making a mental note about what I'll be ordering next time.Can't wait to try the gnocci!!!I finally found a restaurant in town that can be my ""go to"" place.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We live across the street from this new restaurant and with the bitter cold, didn't want to travel too far. We were BEYOND pleasantly surprised with this new gem so close to home. We were greeted the moment we entered by the extremely friendly hostess (who just so happened to be the owner's wife which we later found out). The restaurant was packed and the ambience was upbeat. BYO was also an incredible added bonus!  We enjoyed a delicious meal from start to finish. The service was impeccable as the waitress was extremely attentive and timely. I would highly recommend the Bruschetta, Pappardelle alla bolognese and pollo alla milanese. The Italian desserts were also a nice touch to the end of our meal. I enjoyed a delicious gelato to quench my sweet palate. Everything looked delicious as we looked around at the other entrees amongst the tables nearby. The decour was very tastefully done with an inviting feel. The owner was beyond friendly and thanked us for coming in-you don't get that everyday! It had a family feel and the menu was based off of the grandmother's recipes. How great! My husband and I look forward to another meal soon at Otto Strada as we know it is a sure bet to be a great meal. I wish them the best of luck as they start their new business venture and suggest you venture in for some true tasty italian cuisine.

I then said that I would stay there to drink it and they told me, um no not today we are busy. Well there were only two tables that were occupied (which should have been a bad sign in the first place being that it's Mother's Day). Never coming back and trust me I'm someone who eats out a lot!

But 5 minutes later they were being served cake - so she flat out lied.  After almost 70 minutes we were seated.  We don't mind waiting but the hostess and the restaurant need to learn how to MANAGE EXPECTATIONS. To be fair, the hostess did offer to comp us a dessert but we graciously declined.The FoodEven though we were somewhat annoyed given our wait, we were determined not to have the experience ruin our dinner.  We can only vouch for what we had, which unfortunately was NOT that great.  First I guess they were in such a rush to seat us after the wait that they never filled our water until we asked - I think this is also a function of 1 waiter which doesn't work in there.  Another recco would be for the restaurant to have either 2 waiters or add a bus boy.  I ordered the orecchiette and my wife ordered the chicken milanese which we have had at multiple other places...the dishes were surprisingly bland and plates were rather small for the price...I guess we just expected more.  The BillNot a big deal, but we went to pay with an Amex to which we were told they only take visa/mc.  OverallIt was a strange experience and we were flat out lied to and ignored for the better part of an hour.  Discounting that however, and just based on the plates we had, it was a mediocre dinner experience, especially for the price.  Those that have never been may want to try it but for us, we can find better food elsewhere.",Otto Strada,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
218,5aIrctlY8LxjDuju686z2w,Gary T.,5.0 star rating,"We had a very pleasurable dining experience at Otto Strada the other night. Our family was celebrating my birthday. My son, who lives in Hoboken recommended this place having dined there himself,. After reading the reviews, I attempted to change the plan and go to one of the several other places that I had gone to in the past. My son insisted upon Otto emphasizing that his girlfriend was excited about going there. I am so glad that I listened to his advice. This place is rated right at the top of any of the many fine Hoboken restaurants. I am a foodie and love going out for meals. Since our party of 6 was the noisiest group that night, I can't complain about the noise level. The decor is Simple Manhattan Eatery Style. Nothing fancy, simple and comfortable. The waiter was excellent. He was very attentive and prompt. A very personable, likeable guy who really cared. We ordered Salsiccia for our appetizer which is Sausage, broccoli rabe, ricotta salata and grilled hot Italian peppers and a pizza. Mmmm, so good! Great flaver and texture. The pizza was over the top. For the entre, my son and wife ordered the Melanzane alla Parmigiana. The serving was huge. It was layered and stacked, thinly sliced  the way I like it. Soooo good! My wife who is a fussy eater said that it was one of the best she has ever had. We took half of it home and had it last night for another dinner! (My son liked it too). My daughter, who also lives in 'Boken got a creamy Fettuccini dish that was excellent. I got the lasagna special. (a more traditional type not the one on the menu). Again, huge portion was added to the next night dinner fare. The other two dishes were excellent from what they said. The boyfriend finished his, so I know it was good. I highly recommend Otto Strada. Go for yourself and please post a good review. Like my wife said, most of the people who post reviews are those who post negatively.
