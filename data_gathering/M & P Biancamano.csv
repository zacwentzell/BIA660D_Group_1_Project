1,XIVhlE211QvcDkoZtmZ1uw,Fox E.,5.0 star rating,"So when I found out that Bianca was a man, I challenged her to a duel. I said ""I wanna challenge you Bianca...mano a mano. And she was like ""omg that's a cool name for an Italian deli"" and the rest is history.What does M & P stand for? Mozzarella & Perfection! Because Hoboken *is* Mutz perfection (they call it Mutz in these parts).As I've said many times before Hoboken is the mother of all Italian deli destinations. There is nothing better than an Italian deli in Hoboken. The sandwiches here are second to none. I was never even a fan of Italian deli sandwiches until I started trying some of these around here. They are off-the-charts good. There are five or six of them within a very small area that are absolutely orgasmic.Oh I've figured out what M & P really stands for: Mom & Pop. Which is a coincidence because I dated both of yours.M & P is right up there with the very best. You should always order a half sandwich because the big one is insanely large unless you happen to be sharing it. It's lovely that this deli offers half sandwiches, because most of the delis in this region only sell full sandwiches and they're way too big, much like your boyfriend. Oh wait he's way too small. Not even when I'm starving can I eat a full Hoboken deli sandwich. M & P stand for Meat & Potatoes but they mainly have sandwiches... I'm confused.Here at M & P, everything is perfect as always from the imported meat to the bread they use to the perfect soft fresh mozzarella which is what makes Hoboken famous. And the girl serving me, who was absolutely wonderful.M & P stands for Malnourished & Pouty, which is what I'd be if M & P ever closed down.So let me tell you, there's a secret. The best Italian delis in the world are not in New York City. They are not in your hometown of whateversville, Missouri. They are not in Italy or France (although there's some damn good sh** over there). Forget Long Island. Sorry Chicago. Nope. The best Italian delis in the world are in Hoboken and Jersey City. Yes, it's true. Don't ask me why, they just are.Oh I've figured out what M & P really stands for: Maternal & Pregnant. Like your gf, whenever she comes over to my place.There are 5 spots in Ho-broken, all vying for the title of the world's best Italian Deli, I can't decide which of the 5 is best, and people I've taken to them have differing opinions. Although one thing we all agree on is: if the other 4 didn't exist, then the one remaining would be the best in the world. That's how good these 5 are.Oh I've figured out what M & P really stands for: Male & Pretty. Hmm, do we know anyone who is both of those things? (bats lashes)Fran's, Andrea Salumeria, M & P Biancamano, Vito's, and Fiore. I've been going between the 5 as my fave for the longest time, but if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one: I'd pick all 5. And so should you.Oh I've figured out what M & P really stands for: Masochistic & Pathetic (like your ma. I would know).The selling point of all 5 (and all good delis in this area) is that they have Fresh Mozzarella. I mean fresh, fresh. It's literally fresh, like, still gooey, warm, squidy, just made, and absolute heaven. Their imported meats are the best of the best. Their breads and seasonings, incomparable. You can't get any better than these sandwiches. Come and try for yourself. They have ruined all Italian delis everywhere for me, forever. For a traditional Italian sandwich, nothing will ever compare to Hoboken.Oh I've figured out what M & P really stands for: Men & Penises (my 2 fave things on earth).",M & P Biancamano,4.5 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Delis"

Yes. There are many other places in town that others are loyal to but trust me when I say no one serves it up like Pete and Teresa (the owners).If you decide to get a sandwich anytime after 2:00pm you might be pushing your luck and get the sad news they're out of bread. That's because people line up early to get their hands on one of the signature sandwiches with mutz. I keep it simple and always order a ham, salami, and mutz sandwich. If I'm feeling daring I'll add some roasted red peppers. You can get your sandwich on a roll, half Italian bread, or a whole Italian bread both offering hard and soft. This sandwich is HUGE. They are known to load it up with the cold cuts and mutz. I always get a roll sandwich and at times when I've gotten a half it was to split it with someone. M&P has been around since it was ""Old Hoboken."" It's a true Italian family place filled with so much culture. They truly appreciate their customers and that's what makes you want to come back.

Meats.My most sincere apologies to Bova's Bakery in Boston - your reign of ""best Italian sub"" ended the moment I took my first bite.A good measure of any deli like this is how strong of an Italian they have - and believe me, it is AMAZING. For $9, I got a fully loaded Italian piled so high (with some of the tastiest Italian meats i've ever had) that the bread wouldn't even close . It lasted me two lunches, though it was so good I'm surprised I didn't kill the whole thing in one sitting.And this was just ONE sandwich. I still need to try the roast beef, the mutz, the various parms...but I know they will be amazing, because this one sandwich...it's hard to find the right words to accurately describe it's greatness. I'm an Italian guy through and through, so I could come here every single day.Even if you aren't in the market for a sandwich, they have other Italian food, Italian sides, and a lot of Italian groceries to buy.I was the only one in there (late lunch) and had time to stare at every single thing they sold and chat with the awesome owners (who spoke, of course, Italian) while I ate my food.There are a lot of places to go in Hoboken for food like this, and many of them are fantastic - but M&P, at this moment, tops the list for me.Go here.

For $9, I got a fully loaded Italian piled so high (with some of the tastiest Italian meats i've ever had) that the bread wouldn't even close . It lasted me two lunches, though it was so good I'm surprised I didn't kill the whole thing in one sitting.And this was just ONE sandwich. I still need to try the roast beef, the mutz, the various parms...but I know they will be amazing, because this one sandwich...it's hard to find the right words to accurately describe it's greatness. I'm an Italian guy through and through, so I could come here every single day.Even if you aren't in the market for a sandwich, they have other Italian food, Italian sides, and a lot of Italian groceries to buy.I was the only one in there (late lunch) and had time to stare at every single thing they sold and chat with the awesome owners (who spoke, of course, Italian) while I ate my food.There are a lot of places to go in Hoboken for food like this, and many of them are fantastic - but M&P, at this moment, tops the list for me.Go here.

It is located on Washington Street and is easy to walk by, which would be a mistake. The homemade mozzarella (mutz) is out of this world! Clearly others are fans, as they have won Hoboken's Mutz Fest multiple years. My go-to is the meatball sub. Homemade meatballs are enormous, moist, and full of flavor. The bread it comes on is a buttery and soft ciabatta sub roll perfect to sop up the extra sauce - you can also request ""crispy"" bread which I recommend if you're taking the sub to go. Top with some of their homemade mutz and it's perfection!!! Unless you are incredibly hungry or sharing with a friend, the half sandwich is plenty. Their other subs are just as delicious, using beautiful meats and fresh ingredients. The staff are super friendly and old school, adorably speaking Italian to one another behind the counter.

It's always been my, and my mother's, favorite.This time around my boyfriend (who had never had any Hoboken mozzarella cheese before) and I decided it was time to put the cheese to the test.  I'm sure we missed a few places but we had limited time so we decided to try 5 of the highest rated, longest standing, and most renowned in town.My boyfriend never had fresh mozzarella before, so he didn't even recognize this as mozzarella cheese.  Of course I told him, 'this IS mozzarella cheese. Everything else you've had packaged to date is an imposter.'I think it's important to know exactly what you're tasting, so I recommend you taste the mozzarella in each location by itself PRIOR to/INSTEAD of just ordering it in a sandwich.  The taste by itself will really show you what the mozz is made of.Here's how the tour went and brief feedback for each location's mozzarella. My feedback and ratings (above) are solely based on the caliber/taste of mozzarella cheese, not the quality of everything else they sell or the service they provide.They are ALL in comparison to Vito's since that was my baseline.  Vito's is made fresh 4 times daily.  After tasting some of the best choices in Hoboken, I've come to the conclusion there is simply no better fresh mozzarella cheese in town than Vito's. Or anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's still my favorite. Stop 1: Vito's: Buttery, soft, warm, wet, salty, and literally melts in your mouth Stop 2: Biancamano: Great mozzarella taste overall, a little chewier than Vito's, nice amount of salt and a little wet from the brineStop 3: Lisa's: Great taste inside, but not salty with each bite on the outside.  Also a bit chewier than Vito's Stop 4: Fiore's: The saltiest of all 5 mozzarellas.  Also was the coolest (temperature-wise) and was slightly chewier than Lisa's and Biancamano 5: Luca Brasi: Coldest (temperature-wise) of them all, nice amount of salt, not too buttery however.  Unfortunately I found the texture to be more like cottage cheese once you start chewing it.*This exact review is posted across 4 different locations on my 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour.'",M & P Biancamano,4.5 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Delis"

They are very friendly, eager to take your order (and make your food), and, at least for me, seemed to read my mind of exactly what I wanted. You can tell they care about their customers, it shows in everything they do.Food/Drink: I had a classic Italian sub w/ two bags of chips. The sub was incredible. I have never had anything like it.

Honestly, I am not exaggerating, this place has changed my sandwich life.Value: You get a sandwich that is ridiculously delicious, and HUGE!, and it's just a couple bucks.

72,dJlfPugWdVyEOLaGtnk-dg,Alex A.,3.0 star rating,"The owners were friendly and made me feel at home. I went for lunch and had the #1 -- an Italian sub that came with fresh,  delicious cold cuts. My only issue was that the sandwich was TOO LOADED. I couldn't enjoy it as a sandwich. I had to eat the cold cuts separately from the bread. I went for a sandwich and had a meal of cold cuts with a side of bread. Some people might be OK with that, but I wasn't. While I was tackling this behemoth of a sandwich, two different parties came in and both left with at least 2 lbs of the MOZZ. Judging by the previous reviews, the mozz may be the main reason to come here. I'm making this conclusion based on those two customers AND the fact that after I asked for the other half of the ""monster"" to be wrapped up so I could take to go, the owner told me, ""Next time-ah come fo' da Mozzarehhllaa!""  I'm sure it's legit. I'll for sure be returning for the mozz and my 3 stars will likely jump to 5 :)Pic of my sandwich below (could've fed an African village; I don't mean to be insensitive, but it was huge):",M & P Biancamano,4.5 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Delis"

Sure people will jump to say Fiore's, Vito's', Lisa's or Lucas' because they're popular and most likely don't live in Hoboken and/or haven't tasted M & P's. I have been going here since I moved to 12th street and Hoboken in 2008, being right around the corner. I have moved 3 times since, but always make it a priority to get here at least once a month. Anytime friends come to hang out, help me move or spend the day going out and want to grab a sub, I always make it a point to bring them here. I've lived throughout Hoboken and near the other places, having tried them all multiple times when in a rush or walking home after work yet I always feel that they are subpar to M&P. I always get the C with Balsamic and oil without lettuce or tomatoes b/c the sandwiches are so packed and typically get 2 whole subs, which are $8 each, so I can bring one to work. If you haven't been here, be forewarned, the sandwiches are HUGE! I barely eat a half in one sitting. I was thrilled when Pete (the owner) told me they were open on Sundays this past football season and if I was not going out, would get there before they closed at 1. If you really enjoy an Italian sub and a real Italian deli, you have to try here. You cannot find a better place for the money and the friendliness of the owners.",M & P Biancamano,4.5 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Delis"

I don't care that they don't use gloves to make the sandwiches. That's not a big deal. But turning around, handling cash, making change, and going back to making sandwiches is a no-no.  Money is one of the dirtiest things out there.

I let my baby brother order and I don't remember what it was called but we split a half sandwich for around $8 and I could only eat half of my half. It pretty much had every Italian meat possible, as well as a pound of Provolone. Everything was really delicious, there was just a crazy amount of it. It was funny to watch him put it all together.

What pushed me over the edge this past weekend to finally make the walk was hearing Artie Lange talk about it on his radio show and how awesome the sandwiches are.  So Friday we took a walk to check it out for lunch.The deli is a cool little place with a wall of Italian dry goods on the left hand side and the deli counter on your left when you walk in.  I think the M&P stands for mom and pop because it's an old Italian couple who are there to service you.  They have a few daily hot specials, on Friday they had shrimp parm and eggplant parm I believe. Both specials seemed to be selling quickly.  I was there for the sandwiches though so I stayed the course.  I ordered two half sandwiches which ended up being way too much food for 2 people.  2 people can easily split a single half and be totally satisfied.  The sandwiches are stuffed with meat and fresh mozzarella and they are well worth the price.  Take note that if you want any toppings such as tomato, lettuce, peppers, etc make sure you ask for them.  Otherwise you sandwich will comes with nothing but meat and cheese.  They also cost a bit extra but the price of a sandwich is still reasonable for how big it is.The sandwiches can get a bit sloppy because they are so big but the rolls hold up well to all the punishment all the meat does when you are trying to eat it.  The meats were sliced fresh while assembling the sandwich and the fresh muzz is cut in huge chunks and tossed on very generously.Bottom line is the sandwiches are very good and filling but so far my favorites sandwiches are still coming from Vito's in Hoboken a few blocks down.",M & P Biancamano,4.5 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Delis"

I was visiting NYC from the west coast and had a friend introduce us to this fine establishment on our way to the airport. I ordered a combo A to share with my boyfriend. Let me tell you! My boyfriend can eat like it's no one's business. We ordered a whole sandwich thinking it would be no sweat to polish it off before our flight. The thing was STUFFED TO CAPACITY with sopressata, salami, mortadella, capicola, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, hot peppers, and oil/vinegar. The owner sliced the sub into quarters, rolled them up in wrapper, and bagged it for us. Carrying that bag around was like carrying a brick. It was dense. It was heavy. Upon first bite, we realized that we were in WAYYYY over our heads. I couldn't even take a bite of everything at once. I had to take a bite of bread, then bite the meats and cheeses, and then bite the other side of bread. There is just no way to smash that thing into a good biteable size. I swear.
