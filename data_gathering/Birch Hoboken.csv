It's no secret that I was excited to give this restaurant a try especially with their widely-praised and decadent milk-shake creations.  Having nothing to do on a Saturday evening, I thought it best to grab an early dinner before all the Hoboken ruffians came out in droves for their weekly orgy ritual called bar-hopping. After looking at the menu, I knew that the Graze Burger was going to satisfy my taste-buds that evening. A perfectly cooked, juicy steak topped with mission figs, caramelized onions, honey goat cheese, and baby arugula for some nice bitterness was absolutely spot-on.  The umami taste of the burger played very well with the sweetness of both the fig and honey goat cheese. It reflects a heavy Mediterranean flavor which I loved. A burger meal would not be complete without a side of fries and because I like to play Russian roulette with my arteries, I opted for the loaded fries. A delicious presentation of French fries, sour cream, bacon, and chives. Last, but certainly not least, was my drink of poison for that evening.  I went with the restaurant's namesake ""Nuts About Birch."" Let me simply copy the description from Birch's website: ""Reese's peanut butter pie, butterfinger crunch drizzled chocolate syrup, assorted chocolate pretzels, chocolate covered rim, reese's pieces, chocolate ice cream blended with nutella & peanut butter, and fresh organic milk....sorry my heart stopped for a second as I dreamed about that shake and at the same time reflect at how ridiculous being a foody is.

NIGHTCLUB: as far as the night club goes it was overall a pretty average night club experience in hoboken. They played good music, music you would find on the radio the dj was pretty good and they had props which was a plus. Its also best to put your name on the vip list online to avoid paying the cover. The place is nicely decorated. Will i return for the night club? Maybe but would not be my first choice. BRUNCH: so my friends and i follow them on instagram and saw all of the great pictures and brunch that was advertised so we decided to go. The service was  not good, very very slow. It took about 15 minuets for them to bring our mimosas. They had about one server working for the brunch they advertised so well. Which i didn't understand. The menu as far as food went was very disappointing. There is no brunch menu per say just the little appetizers that stick on top of the bloody mary and thats pretty much it. No brunch food at all. Highly disappointed because we had came with an appetite for brunch food. So that led us to have to order burgers off of there regular menu. The burger was good, good quality meat. Would i go back for brunch? Absolutely not. If your looking for a place to have bottomless mimosas and drinks with your friends and just have drinks. This place is a good fit. However, if you are looking for an actual brunch to accompany your mimosas this is not the place. There are plenty of other places in hoboken that serve a good meal and even have bottomless drinks on Sundays.

9,y_LETSyVwMVKbMSHwHDioQ,Erin A.,4.0 star rating,"We were looking for somewhere different to go to in Hoboken since we are frequent visitors. BIRCH came up on yelp. Good old yelp! The first thing that of course caught my eyes were the milkshakes so I had to go. Birch is located nicely right off of the main street, not too hard to find parking on a weekday. The interior is very nice very contemporary and modern. There was a cool pod like swing and there's string lights everywhere. Loved the ambiance. There's also a club like area upstairs for night life, I didn't get to see it but I would definitely consider going back to check it out! Milkshakes There are 6 choices ranging for 13-15 (not terribly priced). We got the carnival ($15) which was vanilla, strawberry, with candy, cereal, cotton candy!The taste was 10/10. I drank it all, literally so good!Presentation though was not really like the photo on the menu. It wasn't as full of candy and decorations like the menu photo. Food They had many different burgers to choose from. I'm a vegetarian and there was only 1 choice which was a bean burger. I do not like bean burgers though. So we got 2 orders of fries. -Old bay fries $7 I really enjoyed the flavor! No complaints !-White truffle fries $7 Can never go wrong with truffle fries !The staff was great as well, very attentive!I definitely would go back to try other shakes and to check out of the nightlife! I really liked the ambiance of the space!",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"
10,Vr94oCgVobXtkrRkg1i3PQ,Jane Y.,3.0 star rating,"I have been to Birch a couple times now. The first time I went we were seated downstairs in the small bar area with tables for dining (I think about 30 people can be seated?) and the upstairs was closed off for a private event, so my guess is that it's an event space as you could see pre teens throwing some balls around and a photo booth. Unfortunately, there are no doors that could close to separate the upstairs noise from flowing down the stairs and we could loudly hear the DJ and the music. As a result, it was just too loud and we decided to dine elsewhere, and only stayed for dessert. The milkshakes (about $15 each) are everything you would expect them to be - sweet, delicious, smooth, cold, and decadent. They decorate the glasses so lavishly that you can't help but order at least one. I would recommend sharing one with someone as they are truly rich, and each time I've been there, wasn't able to finish one, even when sharing. I have ordered the Cookie Monster Shake, Nuts About Birch Shake, Give Me S'Mores, and It's Mint to Be. For $4 more you can add a shot of liquor to the milkshakes. The pour is not a generous and you cannot taste any alcohol in the milkshakes. In fact, I've even heard tables around me say the same thing to themselves. As for the burgers, they aren't anything special. Each burger entree comes with the option of sirloin or Kobe beef for an up charge of $2. It's totally not worth it. The meat come cooked as requested, but it wasn't any more tender than what a sirloin patty would have been like. They also trick you into choosing the fries (each comes with plain) as they say, ""which fries would you like with that."" You can choose from plain, white truffle, cheese, loaded, and old bay. The brioche bun (I think that's what they use) was a little dry, and every burger comes as described... unfortunately the different toppings just can't be tasted well to make much of a difference to your burger experience.Finally, can't forget to mention the service - each time I've been there two different servers checked on us regularly throughout the night. Our water glasses were always full, and items like extra napkins were brought to us before we had to even ask for them. Needless to say, they were very attentive and the service was great. They were ever present without being annoying.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

This location in Hoboken always turns over, being Reign and BOA previously, I hope Birch is here to stay. I can only speak for the restaurant. It's also a club. I passed by the sign for the milkshakes and had to come in (think Black Tap NYC) but better! They were amazing! And you can spike them with rum or other alcohol for $4 more.I did not try any of the food but the burgers looked delicious. The owner let us try two of their craft cocktails. One of them he lit on fire! (Smoked Old Fashioned). I was thoroughly impressed with everything. The ambiance is classy and fun.

13,s1s9ce3n73vRahPxUiXEzg,Cecilia G.,1.0 star rating,"I paid extra for the ""Kobe"" beef for my bacon cheese burger and got the strawberry milkshake.  The good:It's definitely high quality meat.  Is it really Kobe beef?  I'm skeptical since in the USA they usually get Wagyu beef from Australia and not Kobe beef from Japan. Either way it's excellent quality beef.  The fries were very good.Staff was excellent.  The bad:The burger was bland!  It's definitely NOT seasoned well or seasoned at all.  I had to ask for salt. Any chef knows you need to add some salt or a pinch of salt to bring the flavors out and this has to be done prior to cooking the meat.    So whoever preps the ""Kobe"" ground beef definitely did not add salt or pepper to it.  Even with the cheese and bacon it was bland.  It reminds me of the steak house Prime and Beyond in Fort Lee, NJ.  They get the best pieces of steak like Peter Lugers but they have no idea on how to season the steak.  This place is the same situation. Milkshake was put in a small tall narrow glass.  I get more bang for the buck from a bareburger shake.Conclusion:For the price I paid, I expected way more. Yes the meat was high quality, but what's the point if they don't season it well?  I can pay way less and get a better tasting burger at Del Frisco or Biggies or even get organic grass fed burger at Bareburger. I will give them one more shot.  Hopefully they figure it out cuz it's a shame.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

We swung by here on a Sunday evening and I ordered the ""not your average cheeseburger"" and that came with fries.Overall a solid burger, the bun was lightly toasted and the meat was well grilled. Probably should have ordered it more light medium instead of medium well since the burger wasn't as juicy I like it. One note - they use a thick bacon instead of a thin crispy one. I liked it but I prefer the thins ones.That being said the fries were amazing! They had a old bay + garlic flavoring and were so tasty !

So this is probably going to be a biased review being that I've only experienced this on Halloweekend--one of the busiest times of the year. To be fair every place is probably like this, the problem I had with this particular establishment is that they really need to get a bouncer to regulate line flow and to ensure no jerks skip the line, as was the case on this night. They only had a five foot rope to keep the first bit of line in order. After that it was a free for all. Legit. Which is extremely irritating considering we'd been on line for at least an hour and a half. We actually had to get a police officer not affiliated with Birch to tell someone he can't cut the line. #aggression #drunkdumbbutts if you come here on these types of nights please bring a body builder mean looking dude so they can keep people in line. Particularly because it wasn't just from the side , we were getting skimmed from the side and back. The girls are even worse here because they're sloppy, terribly dressed, and ridiculously pumped up on adrenal because their 'man' is there. GTFOHI'd like to experience this place when it's not trap city. I will say they had a Michael Jackson impersonator who was pretty cool and on point considering we barely got to watch him over the wave of cell phones greedily snapchatting...Also two floors and they served ice cream until closing, which I don't know about you was dope.

The waitresses were great (I've never had two waitresses before) but due to noise level, we decided just to try two shakes and bounce. The shakes are expensive!

You would think they fresh squeezed the tomatoes to make the mix.  The Bloody Mary's were decent I have to admit.  Then it came time to order food.  Of course there was zero brunch type food so we ended up just ordering two sandwiches a grilled chicken sandwich and a vegetable sandwich.  Couldn't even finish them.  Needless to say my wife has taken me off picking restaurants duty.

Today we decided to swing by and have a spiked milkshake, sangria and french fries. My husband had the vanilla and strawberry milkshake with a shot of Bailey's. He decided not to get all frills (e.g. cupcakes, gramcrackers, etc.) that usually comes with milkshake, it's a bit much lol. No frills reduced the milkshake price by $5.The milkshake was very tasty, the shot of Baileys was a great addition!!Sangria is only $7 and it was really good; very flavorful and strong ;)Service was pretty slow considering it wasn't that busy. We got there around 4pm and it took forever to get our fries and drinks; probably 30+ minutes. On the bright side, our waitress did not charge us for the fries! She realized we waited a long time for the fries and did not want us to pay for it, which was really nice of her.Overall, this is a great restaurant to chill, it's not loud at all.

The first thing that of course caught my eyes were the milkshakes so I had to go. Birch is located nicely right off of the main street, not too hard to find parking on a weekday. The interior is very nice very contemporary and modern. There was a cool pod like swing and there's string lights everywhere. Loved the ambiance. There's also a club like area upstairs for night life, I didn't get to see it but I would definitely consider going back to check it out! Milkshakes There are 6 choices ranging for 13-15 (not terribly priced). We got the carnival ($15) which was vanilla, strawberry, with candy, cereal, cotton candy!The taste was 10/10. I drank it all, literally so good!Presentation though was not really like the photo on the menu. It wasn't as full of candy and decorations like the menu photo. Food They had many different burgers to choose from. I'm a vegetarian and there was only 1 choice which was a bean burger. I do not like bean burgers though. So we got 2 orders of fries. -Old bay fries $7 I really enjoyed the flavor! No complaints !-White truffle fries $7 Can never go wrong with truffle fries !The staff was great as well, very attentive!I definitely would go back to try other shakes and to check out of the nightlife!

30,Vr94oCgVobXtkrRkg1i3PQ,Jane Y.,3.0 star rating,"I have been to Birch a couple times now. The first time I went we were seated downstairs in the small bar area with tables for dining (I think about 30 people can be seated?) and the upstairs was closed off for a private event, so my guess is that it's an event space as you could see pre teens throwing some balls around and a photo booth. Unfortunately, there are no doors that could close to separate the upstairs noise from flowing down the stairs and we could loudly hear the DJ and the music. As a result, it was just too loud and we decided to dine elsewhere, and only stayed for dessert. The milkshakes (about $15 each) are everything you would expect them to be - sweet, delicious, smooth, cold, and decadent. They decorate the glasses so lavishly that you can't help but order at least one. I would recommend sharing one with someone as they are truly rich, and each time I've been there, wasn't able to finish one, even when sharing. I have ordered the Cookie Monster Shake, Nuts About Birch Shake, Give Me S'Mores, and It's Mint to Be. For $4 more you can add a shot of liquor to the milkshakes. The pour is not a generous and you cannot taste any alcohol in the milkshakes. In fact, I've even heard tables around me say the same thing to themselves. As for the burgers, they aren't anything special. Each burger entree comes with the option of sirloin or Kobe beef for an up charge of $2. It's totally not worth it. The meat come cooked as requested, but it wasn't any more tender than what a sirloin patty would have been like. They also trick you into choosing the fries (each comes with plain) as they say, ""which fries would you like with that."" You can choose from plain, white truffle, cheese, loaded, and old bay. The brioche bun (I think that's what they use) was a little dry, and every burger comes as described... unfortunately the different toppings just can't be tasted well to make much of a difference to your burger experience.Finally, can't forget to mention the service - each time I've been there two different servers checked on us regularly throughout the night. Our water glasses were always full, and items like extra napkins were brought to us before we had to even ask for them. Needless to say, they were very attentive and the service was great. They were ever present without being annoying.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

And you can spike them with rum or other alcohol for $4 more.I did not try any of the food but the burgers looked delicious. The owner let us try two of their craft cocktails.

Either way it's excellent quality beef.  The fries were very good.Staff was excellent.  The bad:The burger was bland!  It's definitely NOT seasoned well or seasoned at all.  I had to ask for salt. Any chef knows you need to add some salt or a pinch of salt to bring the flavors out and this has to be done prior to cooking the meat.    So whoever preps the ""Kobe"" ground beef definitely did not add salt or pepper to it.  Even with the cheese and bacon it was bland.  It reminds me of the steak house Prime and Beyond in Fort Lee, NJ.  They get the best pieces of steak like Peter Lugers but they have no idea on how to season the steak.  This place is the same situation. Milkshake was put in a small tall narrow glass.  I get more bang for the buck from a bareburger shake.Conclusion:For the price I paid, I expected way more. Yes the meat was high quality, but what's the point if they don't season it well?  I can pay way less and get a better tasting burger at Del Frisco or Biggies or even get organic grass fed burger at Bareburger. I will give them one more shot.  Hopefully they figure it out cuz it's a shame.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

So this is probably going to be a biased review being that I've only experienced this on Halloweekend--one of the busiest times of the year. To be fair every place is probably like this, the problem I had with this particular establishment is that they really need to get a bouncer to regulate line flow and to ensure no jerks skip the line, as was the case on this night. They only had a five foot rope to keep the first bit of line in order. After that it was a free for all. Legit. Which is extremely irritating considering we'd been on line for at least an hour and a half. We actually had to get a police officer not affiliated with Birch to tell someone he can't cut the line. #aggression #drunkdumbbutts if you come here on these types of nights please bring a body builder mean looking dude so they can keep people in line. Particularly because it wasn't just from the side , we were getting skimmed from the side and back. The girls are even worse here because they're sloppy, terribly dressed, and ridiculously pumped up on adrenal because their 'man' is there. GTFOHI'd like to experience this place when it's not trap city. I will say they had a Michael Jackson impersonator who was pretty cool and on point considering we barely got to watch him over the wave of cell phones greedily snapchatting...Also two floors and they served ice cream until closing, which I don't know about you was dope.

You would think they fresh squeezed the tomatoes to make the mix.  The Bloody Mary's were decent I have to admit.  Then it came time to order food.  Of course there was zero brunch type food so we ended up just ordering two sandwiches a grilled chicken sandwich and a vegetable sandwich.  Couldn't even finish them.  Needless to say my wife has taken me off picking restaurants duty.

Today we decided to swing by and have a spiked milkshake, sangria and french fries. My husband had the vanilla and strawberry milkshake with a shot of Bailey's. He decided not to get all frills (e.g. cupcakes, gramcrackers, etc.) that usually comes with milkshake, it's a bit much lol. No frills reduced the milkshake price by $5.The milkshake was very tasty, the shot of Baileys was a great addition!!Sangria is only $7 and it was really good; very flavorful and strong ;)Service was pretty slow considering it wasn't that busy. We got there around 4pm and it took forever to get our fries and drinks; probably 30+ minutes. On the bright side, our waitress did not charge us for the fries! She realized we waited a long time for the fries and did not want us to pay for it, which was really nice of her.Overall, this is a great restaurant to chill, it's not loud at all.

I've lived in NYC for 20+ years and I am not some local yokel NJ suburban fool falling for your BS. I know what I ordered, don't refuse to give me a receipt and then tell me ""We thought you left already, come back and get your credit card tomorrow"" when it's not even 2am and I ordered all of 3 drinks. Then apparently you equate the word ""GHETTO"" with something racial, because your small mind/NJ mentality translates that to mean something racial. No, ghetto is a state of mind. It's whiteboys who wear backyards baseball caps (or a sports jersey) to a bar, or anywhere in public, and think this is normal or means you aren't in high school or just passed your GED.  I will be checking my credit card statement first thing tomorrow (you still didn't provide me a receipt, so good luck saying I closed my tab) and disputing any illegal charges your yokel Jersey arse tried to pull on a seasoned New Yorker.

I then went back and asked how much is a single (of the same drink) and he told me ""$9"".When I asked why the double is more than twice the single, he made a non-believable excuse about tax. Why non-believable? Because he would've accepted $9 for the single.Also, I then bought another double paying with a card, and the bill was $19.24.This might seem like nothing, but if you know what pinching is, this is the equivalent.

She disappeared for over 2 hours and the only time she came was when I had to ask the MC as a favor, who actually went over the mic and got her for us. Throughout that time of disappearance I was going to order two bottles in addition to the one we already had but since she was gone so long members of our party started leaving. So I just ordered one bottle. The worst part though was her attitude. She looked like she didn't want to be there, didn't smile, never once appeared genuine. At one point the pen of the receipt book fell on the floor and she started getting agitated and asking where the pen had gone as if it was my fault it disappeared. You think she have an extra one just incase one of the 300 people in the club bumps into you. Definitely expect better service when spending hundreds of dollars and due to the lack of service there was a missed opportunity on another bottle being purchased.

The part that disappointed us was the 4 shakes we ordered. They were $15 each and they looked really good and were close to the menu pic the taste of them were like watered down room temp milk. We all ate the tops of the shakes but after a couple of sips of the shakes we just pushed them aside. I am hoping it was an off day and they usually have better tasting shakes than we had today.

Bartender made 1 drink and let it sit in the shaker for 10 mins! The drink was watered down and had no flavor. The next drink he made was too small of a pour and did not fill the glass...so he grabbed a smaller martini glass and poured the drink into that one. Will NOT come back.

It was spacious and there weren't a lot of people. To be honest, I went for the DJ. I had a good time and we could dance on a mini stage. I like the multiple levels but always felt like someone was going to fall down them. I don't appreciate the smell they pump into the venue but with more people there, you don't notice it. Now, the second night I went there, most of the places in Hoboken were empty so we came here last. IT WAS PACKED. Which I don't mind either, but I hate when you can't even wiggle through people to the other side of a room. That's rough. The night went well overall but there were too many young people on the stage. At the end of the night there was a fight and while the bouncers worked to control it, it was still rough. A couple guys had a little too much to drink and started swinging. The whole crowd got pushed. I stood on a couch next to the stair to avoid getting crushed against a wall but I though the bouncer and the man were both going to tumble down the stairs. Overall though, I will most likely be back and I would love to try the food at some point.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

They are very creative, and easily shareable, and helped salvage an otherwise disappointing meal.The burger was overcooked and underwhelming (don't waste your money on the Kobe - not worth it), and the fries were fine, nothing special. The specialty cocktails left much to be desired as well.The service wasn't the best either, though that is easily fixable. We were never asked about a second round of drinks, and our water was refilled just once over the hour plus we were there. We were visited by a few other staff members, including someone who appeared to be the owner himself, but unfortunately none of them resulted in refilled glasses.All-in-all, it's a club that happens to serve burgers and shakes on the first floor, so if you go in with low expectations maybe you'll come away impressed.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

Mind you we didn't try to fight them at all, but they came in guns blazing.  That last for 10 mins and then they threw us out.  This place is a joke, the owner is a clown, the bouncers are thugs who think they hold some power and can try to beat people up for no reason.  Don't go this place, you will just get beat up and drink out of plastic cups.  Best part I paid them in cash so I couldn't even dispute, owner did nothing for me because he said he was gonna get sued.  I wonder why he is gonna get sued though.",Birch Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Bars,, Gelato"

I'm not always crazy about loaded veggie patties, which is why I usually buy one or two brands that I know are fantastic, but I obviously can't do that at a restaurant so I'm happy to say this one isn't plain or mushy whatsoever. Birch also added avocado & caramelized onions for a very small fee of 50¢ each. I wasn't over the moon for the fries due to the lack of flavor but they had a nice crisp to them. I was able to hide the blandness with ketchup. I would, however, ask them to add salt if you want to avoid a familiar fate. The drinks were good but obviously contained less than average liquor. I'm almost certain my Moscow Mule had half a shot of vodka at best. I've noticed a lot of places in Hoboken do this so I wasn't shocked nor angry. It is what it is, right?

Did she go to a garden to fetch the muddled berries that was in the drink? There's no way it takes that long to make a signature drink, and if it does don't market it.  Secondly, i got the prime burger and am dairy and gluten free.  I asked for no bun, and the menu did not say there was cheese on the burger, so I didn't request no cheese.

Glass of the red wine was very good, however I ordered a dirty martini with olives. It tasted like vodka with a splash of club soda.

I would have preferred it to be juicier but a dash of A1 sauce helped cut through some of the sweetness of the toppings. My friend ordered the french onion and she seemed to enjoy it. I think what was impressive was how light the burgers felt - they didn't sit in your stomach like a rock. Truffle fries were good, but don't hold back ok the truffle oil. Bay seasoning had a definite kick. A little crispier would have been nice but definitely not bad. The shakes are massive! I think next time, we'll split one.
