Both were very good. The food isn't going to blow you away here but we like Michelina for its casual atmosphere, decent food, large portions and the fact that its BYO. And on that note, I would like to remind the PATRONS of a simple BYO rule: WHEN YOU FINISH DINNER, PLEASE CLEAR YOUR TABLE!  DO NOT LINGER OVER THE BOTTLE OF WINE THAT YOU BROUGHT!  If you wish to stay and occupy a table on a busy night, then order coffee or dessert. It is just rude and unfair to the servers to camp out and finish a wine that the restaurant did not sell to you. Turning tables is how the restaurant and servers earn their living.It was unbelievable. This couple of women had finished dinner and occupied a four-top the entire time we were at Michelina, lingering over their 1.5 Liter bottle of Yellow Tail (ugh!). Meanwhile, there was a line of at least 6 people waiting for a table. They didn't take the hint when the server repeatedly came back for the check.

I just ordered $50 worth of delivery from this place and the $11 Caesar salad came as just a bowl of soggy lettuce- no croutons and no Parmesan cheese. How hard is it to make a Caesar salad- it only has 3 ingredients? I called to tell them figuring they would offer to fix their mistake--that's a pricey bowl of soggy lettuce--and was told by the manager too bad, you got the salad we're not refunding it, and when I protested he hung up on me. I said it cost you 2 cents to make this salad and I didn't get what I paid for, and the manager, Vinny, said so what, croutons cost 25 cents, do you want a 25 cent refund?

42,BhWgN6MpgPG059m6vw-Czg,Ashley L.,1.0 star rating,"Update to my previous review: My family of 5 and I dined here again this week. We generally come here 1-2 times per month. I've got to say, after this week's visit, we will not be returning. The food as always was fine. And as per usual, we felt extremely rushed. We were the ONLY party in the entire restaurant; not one other person. We placed our order and once again our entrees hit the table before we finished the appetizer. We had not one but two servers constantly hovering around our table taking plates the moment we finished the last bite. I'm talking the second you finish your bread, they're pulling the bread plate away. It is so ridiculous and uncomfortable. They were asking if we wanted to wrap food to go before we even finished eating! Literally. We could hardly have a conversation because someone was at the table every minute... that is until the check came. Once the check was dropped, both servers hovered in the back of the restaurant. We added 20% gratutity, signed the receipt, only to then realize something wasn't adding up. BE MINDFUL OF THIS: They staple TWO receipts to your order. On the BACK of the order form, the waitress calculated her own twenty percent tip and added that to the top receipt's total. The second receipt has the total before gratuity. NOWHERE on any receipt will you see the word 'tip' or 'gratuity.' One server came by, not our main one, and we asked her if the tip was included. She explained that the tip was calculated and included and we could find that on the BACK of the order and that tip was included for parties of five or more (I've never seen this for less than 6 people). VERY SNEAKY. From here on out, our main waitress stayed in the kitchen until we left. She never came by to ask how our meal was, ask if we needed anything, NOTHING. The moment we left, literally as we crossed the street, we saw her walk to our table. Luckily we caught this before we handed back the check with an extra 20% tacked on top of her already included gratuity. Not to mention, prices on the receipt do not list which food item it's for and these prices do not match the menu. There are about a dozen awesome Italian restaurant in Hoboken I can think of off the top of my head. Visit literally any one of those before coming here.

My boyfriend and I ordered Chicken Francese and Chicken Parm entrees and a side of garlic bread.Garlic Bread - HUGE portion literally a whole long Italian roll of bread. Very garlicky (in a good way, cause I love garlic).Chicken Francese - Just blah for me. It comes with a pasta - NO VEGGIES?! What the heck. I made a comment on the delivery order  in the ""notes"" section asking for veggies instead of pasta and when I received my order...NO VEGGIES. Not only does this not come with veggies, they wouldn't even substitute pasta for veggies. Usually restaurants include veggies in the entree so I was unhappily surprised.Chicken Parm - pretty good. Thin pieces of chicken cutlet, really good tomato sauce, fresh mozz on top of spaghetti.  I would get this again.The food was good, I'd like to try dining in at this place to see how it is on premises.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

There is ample room for seating nearly any size group and you don't really feel cramped while you are there.Bathroom: The bathroom is average. It's pretty clean and decently lit.Staff: Our waitress was nice. She promptly took our order, while answering any questions we had (and even making substitutions as requested). Additionally, our food came out warm and in an average amount of time.Food/Drink: This place is BYOB (which we forgot about until we arrive... bummer), so we did not have any drinks. The food we ordered was pretty average; again it wasn't anything that wowed us: Chicken Alfredo, Penne Vodka, Lobster Ravioli, and Oysters/Seafood Diablo. The little Bruschetta they give you to start the meal is nice, though it is odd that it is not on the menu...Value: The prices were about what we were expecting to pay.

My boyfriend and I remembered it one Monday.  Our usual Italian place is closed on Mondays and I was craving a big bowl of non-intimidating pasta. So we went.It was practically empty, which I understand as it was Monday and relatively early. The staff showed no shortage of friendliness and openness to accommodating their guests. They even suggested some delicious concoction on the menu to appease my craving. The menu is what you would expect of an old-school Italian restaurant and so is the amicable atmosphere. The food was simple and delicious, hearty and heard-felt; it was exactly what I was looking for. Each round crab and lobster ravioli was smothered in creamy vodka sauce, while the penne was coated in fragrant and flavorful pesto and the chicken cutlet was just right. Michelina's is perfect for a low-key carb-heavy dinner and excellent, friendly service. Oh yeah... and the tiramisu is super delicious. I'll be back.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The meatballs were moist and flavorful and in my opinion, the sauce was perfect. It was smooth with no seeds; not too thin and not too thick. Our table had the meat lasagna, butternut squash ravioli, and rigatoni with zucchini, eggplant, and fresh mozzarella. Everyone enjoyed their large portioned meals.

As opposed to making a true arrabiata sauce, infusing the red pepper flake in the tomato so it is spicy throughout, they had thrown some hot peppers into tomato sauce straight from the can that was sweet and unseasoned.

I didn't realize the restaurant was BYO, so Joe gladly poured me a nice glass of red wine. I was also given bruschetta (AMAZING) and additional bread. The lobster rav was delicious! Not only that, but Joe insisted I try the house tiramisu...absolutely INCREDIBLE. A must-have. Wow. I didn't know how good this place would be but I will definitely be going back (with friends...and a bottle or three of wine).

Chef is quite young, but he knows what he's doing. Don't expect a 5 star restaurant plating when the food comes out. But do expect absolutely delicious no frills Italian food. You sit down and they serve you a piece of bread with bruschetta, and a loaf of warm bread with butter to start off with. We first ordered Rice Balls, perfectly crispy on the outside.. One of the best I've ever had. Inside was your peas and risotto but they also had some ground beef which was a nice touch. The marinara they served with it was a little sweet and perfect, like real sauce. Absolutely delicious. I got one of the specials which was stuffed rigatoni with chicken and vodka sauce. Nothing but great things to say. Absolutely amazing. Sauce was on point, the chicken cooked perfectly, and the rigatoni was cooked just right and not soggy. For dessert I had the cannoli. I wanted to try to the tiramisu, but it's been so long that I've had a good cannoli. Glad I ordered it.. Again.. Very good you'd be surprised how many places can mess it up.. But they didn't. I would say it would've been nice to add some chocolate chips on it or maybe even a sprinkle of powdered sugar, but like I said.. Don't expect presentation. Expect good quality food.

We went on a Tuesday night, so there was no wait, in fact we were the first people there and sat outside on a beautiful evening. The service was prompt and friendly. They give you complimentary bruschetta, it's wonderful, a bit too much oil but still great. We ordered the melon and prosciutto (and yes people in the actual language of Italian you pronounce the O at the end). It was simple but great.My Mom got the Rigatoni Vodka, delicious. I got chicken and baby eggplant, delicious, my dad got penne, meat sauce and meatballs. Simple, yet wonderful. The bread was great, the entrees were great, the service was great. We got a couple cannolis for desert and they of course were simple, but wonderful. I loved this place. It's small, hole in the wall, mom and pop and that's what makes it great.

91,Ebj9E2or5y_ON-mENNOzfA,Tristan P.,3.0 star rating,"I am giving Cafe Michelina 3 stars because I feel like the pluses are equally balanced with some minuses. To start with some positives, the food was OK. Nothing spectacular, but decent.  The restaurant is cute, but small, and is filled with the charm.  You are automatically started off with bruschetta, which is a unique twist that I haven't seen before. Also, the restaurant is BYOB, which always helps to keep the bill down. The minuses - When I said the restaurant is small, I meant tiny.  A party of 12 filled about half the restaurant and delayed seating times. The staff, while friendly, are slow due to the limited number of available hands. Once seated, we waited for at least 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order and no one told us of any specials for the night.  My boyfriend's chicken franchaise we a bit salty... too salty. Overall, the experience was OK, but I think I will try some different restaurants before going back to this one the next time I am in Hoboken.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Although food came out quickly, they were looking to clear the tables quickly, too. They actually brought out the check before they served our coffee. Being rushed sucks! Limited and terribly boring menu, but that's the good news because the food was not even mediocre. You can get better marinara sauce on sale at Shop Rite. Chicken Parm should be a slam dunk at a family-run Italian restaurant, but they bounced it off the back rim for no points. It was bland and skimpy and the penne that came with it was under-cooked.

However, if you've been to Scalini, Il Baggato, Babbo, il Mulino, Orsa, Scarpetta, SD26, Da Silvano, Scotto, etc., etc., don't even bother -unless it's that or McDonald's (and then, at least give it some fair consideration before deciding). Whomever it was said the mussels were ""AMAZING!"" must've just been rescued from a month at sea. Some of the most bland and flavorless red sauce you can imagine without actually sending 'em back. It was such a disappointment dipping the bread into the sauce when you knew it looked great but was gonna taste like Hunts tomato sauce.My date ordered the tilapia francese - which, suprisingly enough was very good - but I figured I'd try a staple Italian dish and see what they did, so I got the linguine and white clam sauce (which the waiter said was 'excellent'). They should call it linguine in white clam 'soup' - as my pasta was practically floating in a broth of chicken stock or something. Almost flavorless, I was forced to put Parmesan cheese on it and salt. The dessert arrived frozen. the help is fine but wants you in and out asap so it's not a place to take your time, as there's always 8 groups of hungry locals giving you the evil eye for your table like in the Disneyland food court. All in all, I'd go back just to try their 'vodka sauce' or a staple dish, but it just once again proves my theory ""you can't find any great restaurants in all of Hobroken.""

What I found was mediocre food at a low enough price that it almost balances out -- except that they jack up prices on the specials. In my opinion, Michelina is a classic example of low end Italian food. We started with stuffed artichoke ($9). It was good enough. A lot of bread stuffing, a bland buttery sauce -- no real spice of flavor, but artichoke is always fun.My girlfriend had the eggplant Parmesan ($12). She enjoyed her dish. And the eggplant was nicely cooked, but most of the dish was spaghetti with very standard tomato sauce. I had the chicken Sorrento ($19 - was a special didn't know the price). Chicken, mozz, eggplant, capers. I got tiny rounds of eggplant, bland baked chicken, and a watery white sauce. Overall, I felt this was the sort of food I would make on a week night if I were in a hurry and didn't feel like cooking much -- just dump some red sauce on pasta and bake a unprepared chicken breast.  Also the ambiance felt more dumpy than cute to me. We were there on a Tuesday, so maybe on a weekend it feels more lively, but the cheesy paintings, tiled floors, and sloping table didn't do it for me. The tin walls are cool though.

They spend more time smoking right next to the outdoor seating than taking orders. The daughter is by far the worst of them all, but they are all degenerates. The place looks dirty and I am pretty sure I saw a member of the kitchen staff go out to make a delivery on his bike and then go back to the kitchen without washing his hands. He too walked outside and immediately lit up a cigarette right next to me while I was eating. The sauce tastes like something out of a cheap can and the chicken was thin and somehow still dry.

116,o5pT87GuZjMktUZCPRzpbA,Katie D.,4.0 star rating,"In celebration of one of my roommate's birthday last week, we decided to hit up Cafe Michelina.  We had been there once before and had been so blown away by the food that we elected to walk the 2 miles home, giggling wildly about how delicious everything had been.As we pulled up in front of the restaurant, my other roommate who was having an unbirthday swung the car door open and a passing driver smashed into it.This is important for two reasons.  One, because everyone should know that people are, always have been and always will be maniacs.  Be careful out there.  And two, it should be pointed out that by the time we sat down to dinner, it was far closer to closing time than normal dinner time.Being a little shaken up from both the accident and the thought of obscene insurance deductibles, it was an outstanding thing that Michelina is BYOB.  Our alcohol bill would have been far more sizeable anywhere else.  The popularity of BYOB in Hoboken is a wonderful thing in general.  It makes a lot easier to go out and have nice dinners more often.After beginning the meal with a fantastic garlic bread and complimentary bruschetta (which I passed on but the rest of my party thought was excellent), we settled in to the main course.  I ordered the smoked mozzarella ravioli from the specials menu.  While it wasn't a terrible meal, it definitely is not something I would ever order again.  It came out a little cold and was a little too smokey for my taste.The rest of my party ordered the penne vodka (spectacular), the fettuccine alla primavera (which was delicious after a cream sauce was substituted for the standard marinara) and the penne with chicken and portobello mushrooms (above average).  The lesson learned with the food here seems to be that you should stick to what's on the menu.  What they know how to do, they do well.  They could use a little practice on the special dishes.As we were there close to closing time, the restaurant was relatively empty so it felt like far more of a spacious place than it actually is.  I can see how others might feel cramped during a busier dinner time.  The proximity to closing time could also explain why my food was below room temperature.  The service was decent, minus our waitress not being able to figure out what fresh pepper is and handing over a standard pepper shaker on two occasions.Our bill came out to just around $70, which was excellent for 4 entrees, garlic bread and a carrot cake - which, by the way, was awful and should only be ordered under extreme duress.  I would definitely eat at Cafe Michelina again, but long gone are those giddy feelings of food joy towards it.  If they just stick to what they know and kept the food hot enough, they would maybe be worth 4 and a half stars.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

I've gotten many wise-ass comments from the waiters and hosts, who are pretty young.....it's really confusing why they treat customers the way they do.  Again, great food but after 3 visits and the same experience each time, I'd say skip and patronize one of the other Italian BYOBs with friendlier staff (i.e., Tratoria Saparito).",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
132,DKL8THTMRcTcMfVuNmaF4g,Hank C.,2.0 star rating,"Not a bad Italian place, it's a noisy, loud place for a BYOB. My napkin was dirty but they replaced the entire set of silverware, too. The waitstaff has one lady with a face that reminds me of Scarlett Johansson. Anyway, the first thing they brought out was a piece of bruschetta for each of us. Probably the best part of the meal, drenched in olive oil, tomatoes, and onions.The pasta isn't bad, al dente, and the specials are decent. The linguine wasn't interesting (it was done well, but the sauce was a plain marinara which was a bit watery), the mussels in wine sauce had very little wine taste to them, although they were piled very high. The tilapia - skip it. The spinach bed was tasty, but the tilapia was just grilled and served up with a little cracked pepper and salt, and lemons to the side.  The cheese tortellini in vodka sauce - pretty creamy and standard, hot, with a dash of parsley to color. Interesting, but the taste, again, felt absent.There was the dessert, too, a tiramisu that was mostly creme, and a little rum and some ladyfingers - delicate, but really triumphant in it's presentation, mostly (delicate whipped cream, sprinkled chocolate shavings and chocolate chips at the corners). Almost saved the entire meal and made it a three.... This place will certainly fill you, and the service is pretty decent. Don't come expecting fine dining, though. Noisy and a bit less than tasty, I will give this local eatery a try again, but next time, I won't take the waitstaff's suggestions...",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

135,Axw9FwbTQpRxQ1R7kQ6-1w,Dan B.,3.0 star rating,"Went to Cafe Michelina for the first time this past weekend. A few friends in town really like this place, so I was excited to try it out. Started with the stuffed artichoke - I think this was an appetizer special - and it was OK. It was stuffed with cheese and bread/bread crumbs - the bread it was stuffed with was a bit soggy, but I guess that'll happen when it's sitting in a quart of oil/broth. Not bad, but I'd pass next time. They also bring bread and butter to the table, but this was nothing special. It was a room temp loaf of bread with butter in the little foil packets. I don't need/expect artisan bread from a restaurant that comes across as a standard spot, but this was sort of disappointing for a place trying to bill itself as authentic Italian.For an entree, I got the stuffed sole (stuffed with crab, scallops, and... soggy bread) with a side of broccoli. Overall the taste was pretty good - the sole was in a lemon/garlic sauce, the broccoli steamed and served with garlic. And when I say I liked the taste, I'm just confirming my enjoyment of garlic. I can't really tell you how the broccoli or fish tasted because there was so much garlic - more garlic than I thought anyone would attempt to cook with (or infuse into the flavor... it was actually quite impressive). My girlfriend got a chicken dish that was served with spinach, mozzarella, and a lemon sauce - she enjoyed it, but said it wasn't anything too special.As for the space - I enjoyed it, it was 'warm.' They fit a lot of people into a small-ish space, but don't make it feel claustrophobic. As noted, it is BYOB which is always a positive. The pricing was standard - 1 app, 2 entrees, and 2 espresso was $56. The service was also very good. At first it seemed as if our waitress was pushing us for our orders, but she explained that the two parties with greater than 8 people each were about to place their orders, and she didn't want us to fall to the back. Get there before 8PM on a Friday to avoid a short wait.I'll probably go back, but won't rush it. 3 stars even for OK food, good space, and above-good service.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The Specials (which never seem to change) have been my favorite of the whole menu. In my experience, the white sauces are pretty lacking, though the ravioli (in vodka sauce - check the specials board) is quite good. Great place to sit outside with a bottle (or two!) in the summer when you're looking for something basic.

We usually order delivery but once in a while we do go to the place.We've been regulars for almost 2 years now. However, on our last visit. I was extremely disappointed by the service. It was a busy Friday evening so we were asked to wait for 40 minutes, no biggie, it was expected. We ended up waiting almost an hour after putting our names down. One of the waiters had some friends show up and he promptly put them ahead of us in line. The other waitress questioned him about it and he just made up some story about them calling ahead. It was very busy and the waitress just threw her hands up in the air and walked away. We questioned the waiter and he just rudely said that his friends called ahead.We were eventually seated, the same waiter was pretty rude throughout the night. We shared a dish and the waiter promptly added a sharing charge without notifying us that there is an extra charge for sharing. We've been to this place many times but have never paid a sharing charge to share a dish. The portions are pretty big so we always share. Odd. I don't mind paying but I'd appreciate being told upfront. If it was on the menu I probably skipped looking at it.Apart from the poor service, the food is excellent.

The food is amazing, the prices are great, and the best thing about this place is that it's a B.Y.O.B. restaurant.  They have outdoor seating, though pretty limited.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, decent prices and good atmosphere.  Manga!",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
171,MaGIKxegvuEK5GJD7r3VgA,tessie s.,1.0 star rating,"I have never in all my years received such a poor attitude from a waitress.  They seem not to  care  about customer service.  Okay here is what happened;-asked for olive oil with my bread as we do not eat butter ( their butter was the frozen kind waped in those tiny little plastic things you would get at a  fast food place).-upon asking for olive oil  i was told ""no"" we only give to those who order  a salad with their meal..  But i said ""i do not want  a salad just a t little oil to dip a piece of bread""; she still said no.  i was left in shock.- then i called her over again and said nicely may I please maybe just have a tablespoon of olive oil so I may dip a piece of bread  The answer was  still a flat out no.  I asked can you ask the owner, she repiied I am the owner.  It was evident she was too young to be the owner.  I said are you are kidding?.  She then identified herself as a relative.-So after 2 minutes we decided to l get up and leave.  They spotted us doing that and a new waitress came over with oil in hand.  However, before giving us th oli she said we coud not leave because we  had already placed our order..  I said so you are demanding I sit down and eat my dinner .  I said I could do what ever I want  Then I said I will stay if you are planning on  giving me that oilve oil in your hand (which she had not offered to me at this point) and.  she said yes. i said then i will stay if you are offering me the olive oil i asked for.-After an arguement about 10 cents worth  of oil I stayed.  However , the original waitress never returned to my table. The attitude of the staff is just so rude and I will never go back.  I was embarrassed and humiliated that this conversation had to take place in such a tiny restaurant  (not the cleanist either) where people had no choice but to hear.   It is evident they just do not care.-Do not waste your money here the restaurent couldn't  care less about you. . They only  care about every penny they are making on you and do  not offer an ounce of respect.  Why on earth would I ever return.-Please save yourself a miserable time and go to Leo's or Margueritta.s where they care about you not the pennies in their pocketbook.I am still in shock!",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
172,mC_kHPgEDxtEIcfbcUZNIA,Karen W.,3.0 star rating,"The food here deserves a 4 and 1/2. It's always delicious. I've had the tortellini alla 'Michelina', penne vodka, chicken portabella - all which I would recommend to a friend. I don't think I could say a bad thing about their menu.Now, their service is a different story. I've gone there a bunch of times with small groups (tables of 2, 3, and 4) - the service was what it should be in a restaurant. Had our order taken, brought out complementary bruschetta, bread, followed up after our entrees came out, etc etc. I had recently gone there for a friend's birthday dinner (16 adults and 2 babies), and the service was awful. There weren't enough water glasses on the table (and no water in any of the glasses that were on the table), we didn't get our order taken until after we had been sitting for 45 minutes, and the bread didn't come to our table until an hour after we sat. We had to flag down the waiter to get water, and after several attempts, we got a pitcher for all 18 of us. Not ideal. It's nice that it's a BYOB place, but we had wine sitting on the table, and after they opened it (took them a while to come by to open it), they left the bottle of white wine just sitting out on the table without an ice bucket. The waiter spent more time talking to the pretty blonde waiting to be seated than to our table. If they're going to add in the gratuity for a large party, at least put in some effort, buddy. There were 2 other large parties and then maybe 3 or 4 small 2 person tables. I would NOT recommend Cafe Michelina for large parties, but if you are looking for a BYOB place with good food for a small group, I would point you here. I normally LOVE this restaurant, but I don't think I would ever plan a large dinner here again.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Food was the BEST we had in Hoboken - I had some sort of lemon zest chicken deliciousness, and my date had something pasta (sorry our memory is foggy). Loved the whole night, wait staff was awesome, very very affordable, but most importantly the food was DELICIOUS. Would go back to Hoboken (dare I say) just for this restaurant.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

175,egnNuORhWl3cB0oRhVKPlQ,Jennifer R.,2.0 star rating,"Another mediocre Italian place in Hoboken. I've eaten here three times (actually, one was delivery and the other 2 were with large groups). 12 of us went last night. I will say that it is ideal for large groups because although the place isn't huge, we were seated comfortably and of course BYOB is great for a big group. The service last night was practically nonexistent. We sat for awhile before they even brought us menus, and at the end of the night, it took us several attempts to even get the bill. We started off with appetizers of antipasto and fried calamari. The fried calamari was surprisingly good. For my meal, I ordered one of the specials, which was chicken with spinach and fresh mozz in a white wine sauce. The sauce was SO salty that it made it hard to even eat. I've had their chicken francese through delivery and thought that it was bland. The one other time I've eaten there, I got the stuffed rigatoni in vodka sauce and chicken and while it was nothing spectacular, it was probably the best thing I've eaten from there. Overall, just your typical average Italian place.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

From the pots of fresh basil growing outside (not just for show) to the owner furiously windexing tables and correcting crooked picture frames, this is the kind of no frills Italian restaurant that I can really enjoy and relax in. The menu is small but filled with staple Italian dishes. We were in the mood for home style cooking and it is exactly what we got. The service was as good as the food.",Cafe Michelina,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
