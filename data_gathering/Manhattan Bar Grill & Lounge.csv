I found them on uber eats and before giving them a try o came on yelp to see if they had any reviews. There were none so I went to google to hopefully see some. To my surprise, they had 4 stars on google. I read through them and after going back on uber eats and seeing the pictures they had next to the dishes they sold, I decided to order. I ordered the filet mignon with rice beans and muduros. Well the filet mignon was cooked exactly how I liked it! And the mudoros tasted like I was in pierto rico. They were so sweet and yummy. I definitely recommend this place. 5 stars. I will be ordering again tonight and will upload some photos.",Manhattan Bar Grill & Lounge,5.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges"
