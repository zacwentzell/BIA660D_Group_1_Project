I was quite pleased.However, it was very sad to see that they were quite understaffed. I had to walk through the restaurant to find someone to put my name down on a waiting list. No one came up to me for 15+ minutes. Once we got seated, it took another 15+ minutes to put in our drink order. I felt bad for our waitress.When we went to order, I asked for a custom omelette with cheese, tomato and spinach. I thought it was a pretty simple request, but they would not take any special requests off the brunch menu given they were busy and understaffed. This was quite disappointing. I ended up settling with Eggs Benedict & my boyfriend got a Burger. Both were satisfying.

41,2hDc3-TvYiWeaKS4y7Fj-w,Scott A.,4.0 star rating,"Best spot in Hoboken in terms of decor. I've gotten the full experience and everything out of Elysian cafe - brunch, dinner, seating in the dining area and the patio. Really great spot in terms of ambiance and has that French feel to it.Brunch menu is great - $6 mimosas and eggs Benedict was made perfectly. During brunch time, it gets very crowded so coming early is your best bet.  Outside patio seating is really good, especially during the summertime. Since Elysian is uptown, you don't have all the outside noise from people and neighboring bars when you sit outside as opposed to downtown.  For Dinner I've tried the mussels, macaroni, and sandwiches.  They have dinner specials off the bar menu that are very good and I recommend coming here if you want a dinner that will leave you stuffed and full. Service during dinner can be a little better as it is slow sometimes and the tables can potentially be a little bigger inside as well.Monday is 2 for 1 night.

My BF and I had walked by constantly, and decided to go on a particularly beautiful night when we were able to go and eat outside. Such a cute place for a date, or brunch/dinner out with some friends - particularly if you can grab an outdoor seat. Our first trip there was for dinner, and thanks to making a reservation, we were seated almost instantly. The service was great from the get go, the wine was poured generously (and brought out quickly), and the garlic fries are the ultimate. The menu is varied without being overly extensive - some French dishes mixed in with American. Playing into that type of menu, my boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites, while I settled on the lobster roll (because we were coming back from a Maine trip and I couldn't get enough). The oyster selection also looked delish, so that will have to be reserved for another trip! After hearing from a girlfriend that the brunch at Elysian is perfection, we headed there one weekend for a Saturday brunch. She wasn't lying - brunch was incredible. Again, our server was lovely, and though it was busy, she made sure we were taken care of. The screwdrivers were strong, the steel cut oatmeal delicious (seriously, it CAN be fucked up so don't laugh), and BF got the gateaux chauds (pancakes), which looked incredible and apparently were since he gobbled them up. I also ordered a side of the Lyonnaise potatoes, which spoiler - are home fries (really, really good ones). It was a perfect brunch with an amazing atmosphere, and the perfect view for people watching (insider hint: bring sunglasses to fully take advantage of this opportunity). Prices are also REALLY reasonable for brunch, so extra worthwhile. Great service, great prices, beautiful location, and amazing atmosphere on a whole.

I had something on the banquette next to me and he was about to seat someone. He said to me ""Can you move that"" without so much as an ""excuse me"" or ""please"" or ""thank you"". Then the (older) woman was seated and within five minutes she asked to sit at a different table because she has hearing problems. He did not say ""I'm so sorry, unfortunately that table is reserved. Would you like me to look for another option that might be suitable?""  His response to her very polite request was an extremely brusque ""There are reservations"" and then walked away.  Eugene. Please take note. I have come here almost once a week for years. I'm sorry to say that the service has declined a lot in the last several months.  Kitchen has become slow, busboy is actually sullen, and the manager is decidedly ungracious and unhelpful.  He does not greet patrons warmly when they arrive, he sometimes acts put out when they arrive, he studiously avoids making eye contact once they are seated, and he doesn't pitch in to help his staff At. All. There can be a check with a credit card waiting to be taken, or dirty dishes crowding a table, or someone holding a baby waiting to ask someone for a high chair, or empty water glasses, or someone with a hand up to get their waiter's attention, and he doesn't come over. He will actually just stand there and avoid eye contact. As someone who worked in restaurants for years, I'm pretty shocked by that. The busboy is largely useless as he doesn't notice empty water glasses, disappears for long stretches, And also acts put out when he's asked to do something.

I have checked out their menu and since I am picky and recently stopped eating meat, I realized that their brunch menu offers the most amount of options for me.I came here with my mother and brother who were visiting me, a little over a month ago. We came here around noon and although the place was pretty full, we managed to get a table right away.  The indoor space consists of two large rooms; the one at the front has a bar with tables across from it and the second room it leads into which has multiple tables. We were seated in the second room and a server came to our table almost immediately, she seemed nice and was attentive throughout our visit. I ordered the egg white omelette (spinach tomato and goat cheese) with Lyonnaise potatoes, while my mom got the Eggs Florentine (poached eggs, sauteed spinach and hollandaise) with the same side and my brother got the Elysian burger. My omelette was one of the best I have had and my mom and brother enjoyed their meals as well. I came here once again with my boyfriend, cousin her husband and their infant son a week ago. We planned on going here for brunch but by the time we got here, they stopped serving brunch and only served lunch. They were quite busy this time as well but still let my boyfriend sit at the table and hold it for the rest of us until we all managed to get there (getting a baby ready to go anywhere takes a while..) so I appreciate that.As per my previously mentioned self imposed dietary limitations, I didn't feel like I had many options and ended up going with the french onion soup and ate some of my boyfriend's Aged Cheddar Grilled Cheese (Toasted Sourdough, Minced Leeks & Onions, Pommes Frites) dish.Our server this time was understanding, considering we were a little all over the place, and was available when we needed him.I know I will be back here, especially when it is once again warm enough to sit outdoors but it will most likely only be for brunch.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

Potatoes were crispy and well seasoned - except the distribution of caramelized onion was uneven from plate to plate.

While she got to us in a reasonable amount of time, she just had this attitude that she could care less about us and seemed to just be annoyed about something. Thankfully, her attitude was not enough to dampen the experience and I would absolutely recommend this place and would like to be back for dinner.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

I've been here for brunch and dinner a few times and have never left impressed. Most recently for brunch, I had the egg white omelette with potatoes.

The location is great, the place is beautiful inside and out but the food is just kinda OK.I've been for brunch and dinner, I will say that I thought the dinner was better. The brunch is really average. I've tried a bunch of things here and really just ok. I The fries are kind of boring and bland and I've had the omelette and it was just that, a regular old omelet. It was no different than an omelet from a diner in my opinion. I think the atmosphere here is what brings a lot of people in. The service is always pretty good. I think the brunch is a bit overpriced for what you get. I would much rather go to Anthony David's.For dinner we ordered only from the bar menu and not the main entree menu so I can't comment on that. But I felt that it was just average. We had to sit close to the door because this place gets slammed so it was cramped and cold. That may have had something to do with just wanting to eat and get out. It's one of the busier spots uptown. The bar is always full and almost impossible to get a seat there as I feel there are a lot of regulars who sit there awhile. It's not worth the wait, there are many other places around if you don't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a brunch table. Honestly, not my first choice for brunch at all, or dinner. I feel it's just way to expensive for the quality of the food. And just average at best.

Their food is always above average and atmosphere is always on point but may be a bit crowded for those who are unaware. The place does fill up, and rightfully so as they do a good job on all aspects of the restaurant. The price point on their brunch is certainly affordable and their $6.00 bloody marys on their brunch specials are always great. The inconsistency of the level of spicy within the bloody marys was dramatic this last Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend couldn't drink the second one he ordered. Not a big deal but just a heads up for those sensitive to a kick. The waiter was good but a little spacey in communication. For example, ""what starch?"" was asked to my friend when she ordered her brunch eggs. She looked at him puzzled and he didn't clear up what types were available or what he meant so I jumped in to break the silence, ""uh. potatoes ok Jill? you guys have potatoes?"" he nodded and walked away. No a big ordeal but one of a few conversations we had where they could of been more clear. My steak was teasty but a bit chewier than I am used too.

104,KzKnbDlcSnAWeMRDd-NBlg,Jenn C.,2.0 star rating,"We arrived for Father's Day Sunday brunch at 10:30am. There was no wait for a table inside or outside. Instead of greeting us and asking for a table inside or out, the hostess stood in front of the door and told us that seating for a table inside would be an hour wait. Looking around the restaurant it was clearly more than half empty with plenty of inside seating. We settled on a table outside but I was still confused why we couldn't sit inside. After we placed our order, I went inside to use the bathroom and walked past the dining room. There were plenty of open tables. I walked back out and asked the hostess if we could get a table inside. She pointed over to the tables in the bar area and said that they just cleared it up and that it was now available. That was completely untrue as those tables were empty when we first walked in. While we were sitting there, people were coming in and the hostess was asking them if they would like to sit inside or outside. I was completely annoyed at this point. Parties of 2,3 etc were coming in and seated right away in the dining area. When we were leaving, the hostess did not say thank you and pretty much ignored us. She was very unfriendly and unprofessional. A restaurant with this reputation should not have someone like this working there. Our neighbors highly recommended Elysian and we were excited to try it out. I'm giving 2 stars since the food was good and the waitstaff were all nice.

I love the vibe and decor inside and look forward to eating outside once the weather gets warmer. The Elysian corner truly gets some of the best sunlight in the warmer months, at any time of day.The food was between average and good, we started with a classic Caesar salad. Nice ratio of dressing to lettuce, with a few croutons and an anchovy on top. I opted for the Eggs Benedict, which was pretty good. The poach on the egg was spot on and it definitely fulfilled my craving. The frites were pretty bland in flavor. Go with the lyonnaise potatoes if you want some starch. My girlfriend ordered a Croque Madame, which couldn't have been further from a true Croque Madame if it tried. The egg was in the middle instead of on top and the whole sandwich resembled an American grilled cheese rather than a sandwich with French flair. 3 stars for food, 4 for ambiance.

I realized that it's directly across from You Lucky Dog (where my stinky yet adorable dog gets bathed) AND it's also dog friendly! It was an absolutely gorgeous day and Elysian's quaint outdoor patio was calling our name! The patio is comfortable and the best seats are the ones that are shaded underneath the large tree. Dogs are welcome, which I of course love, but I love even more that they came over right away with a water bowl for her.Our waitress, a young brunette, was super friendly and very attentive. She told us about her dogs and shared stories and made a lot of small talk, which is nice. She was a great waitress. We both got the unsweetened iced tea (it's very unlike me not to order wine, but I was wildly hungover). The tea was delicious.Their lunch menu is incredibly affordable. We both decided to go with their half sandwich and soup option. What a STEAL at $9! We both got French Onion Soup which came piping hot and topped with a very generous amount of melty gooey cheese. The soup was amazing, and not overly salty like a lot of French Onion soups can be. The amount of cheese was perfect.For my half sandwich, I got the Chicken which came on Rosemary Foccacia, thick cut bacon, a creamy herb mayo and avocado, lettuce and tomato. Wow. It was amazing. For something that sounds so simple and like it could be subpar, it was full of flavor and that thick slab of bacon really made it. My husband got the Croque Monseuir which is basically a French grilled cheese with ham. It was very tasty and came with mustard for dipping, but a much smaller sandwich compared to the chicken.We got a side of Pommes Frites and they are a must, must, must! A little pricey at $6 a side but these perfectly crunchy, oh so salty, savory mouth-watering fries are so worth it!

Walking into this place you feel almost as if you're traveling back into the victorian era; the decor of this cafe is simply splendid and extremely detailed. At Elysian cafe you can choose to sit either outside, by the bar, at the tables alongside the bar, or in the sectioned off back room. My boyfriend and I chose to sit at one of the tables by the bar simply because it was too sunny and humid outside. MY boyfriend ordered off the lunch menu and got half the smoked salmon sandwich and a cup of the tomato vegetable soup. I chose to try out the fish 'n' chips. My boyfriend's food arrived first and then mine, or what was supposed to be mine. I was delivered fish tacos incorrectly, but I let my server know and ten minutes later I received the correct order. This was a bit off putting because by the time I had received my food, my boyfriend was halfway through with his food. My boyfriend's salmon looked and tasted incredibly fresh, with the tomato vegetable soup being the perfect complimentary soup. My fish 'n' chips on the other hand, was literally half good. By this I mean, only one of the two pieces of the breaded and deep fried was good. The other piece had way too much breading that once the fish cooled down, the fish completely separated from the fried part.  I was upset with the inconsistency of the dish and a bit agitated that I had to wait for such an inconsistent dish. If you do decide to come to this cafe, I would suggest you stray from the fish 'n' chips-- not worth the gamble.

It might just be personal preference but I'm a total glutton for that silky sauce.  The poached eggs were great and the sauteed spinach had good flavor.  The fries were really well seasoned too and came in a pretty cute little bucket.  The food got cold quickly but that's just the fault of where we were seated.Our server took excellent care of us.  Also, we were AMAZED by how quickly our food came out.There are lots of great restaurants in this area and this is one I would return to for brunch.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

From 5pm - 7pm Monday - Friday happy hour is half off all cocktails and selected wine and beer. Their cocktails are my favorite in all of Hoboken mainly because they are always STRONG. The bartenders have been there forever and aren't the friendliest, but get the job done. The most friendly bartender is Tommy, but he only works on Fridays. It's definitely not a ""craft cocktail"" bar, but it's better than most of your run of the mill pubs. Favorite cocktails: Car Chase and Jalapeno MargaritaMaybe one of the best things about Elysian is the decor and ambiance. The owner has done a great job restoring the traditional decor. It is unlike any other cafe/bar in Hoboken, much less any other place I have been. The patio in the spring and summer is picturesque and occupied 100% of the time. The entire experience is worth it just to get a seat on the patio during those seasons. The cafe is lit up at night with cafe lights that are help add to the charm. My only complaint about the establishment is the bathrooms. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a restaurant puts so much effort in to the aesthetic and cleanliness of the restaurant and completely gives up on the bathroom. The restroom is always unkempt and feels like a stadium bathroom. The food is mediocre, but pretty par for the course for bar food. The pommes frites are insanely good and are a weakness every time I go. There isn't anything particularly ""healthy"" on the menu.I would recommend: the burger - big and juicythe grilled chicken sandwich -not healthy at all, but decent flavors. the chicken is often dry, but I power through. the rosemary focaccia bread is tasty, but too bready. I usually end up dissecting the sandwich and eating the chicken individuallyFish N Chips - decent portions of fish, make sure to ask for them crispy, sometimes they can come out soggyGrilled Cheese - really good and made with sourdough breadMussels and Pommes Frites - giant portion of MusselsChicken Caesar Salad - the dressing comes with anchovies so be sure to specify if you want them or not, again the chicken is usually dry",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

My child never even got his kids drink that came with his meal. When we asked where the drink was at the end of the meal, the server blamed the bar for being backed up.

Food is nothing fancy but solid.     Been here a few times, the steak last time was very well cooked, but I did not like the cod this time - a bit blend, the sides of it reminded me of a chicken noodle soup. The stuffed chicken breast special was quite nice though. I wish the dessert menu has more non ice cream related items but I did like the puffs.

I was surprised at how great the BLT was. The smoked salmon club was good but the ratio of sauce and greens to the salmon was a little off. The sandwich seemed more like just a straight smoked salmon sandwich. The sauce was faint and the texture was more soft than anything else. we also had a dessert, the double fudge sundae which was chocolate bread pudding with ice cream whipped cream and warm chocolate syrup (really tasty for chocolate lovers).I would definitely come back tho regardless because the other menu items looked really good and I enjoyed my meal overall.

133,kjoeuqQnxocQlJUltR1Rhw,Waz W.,3.0 star rating,"I recently made a brunch pit stop at Elysian Cafe during a long Jersey City to Weehawken walk. Elysian Cafe is the oldest continually operated restaurant in Hoboken with a French bistro style menu. I find this place absolutely adorable, and the outdoor seating is very popular during brunch hours. They had decorated the exterior with a few flags for Memorial Day weekend.The brunch menu was very reasonably priced, and they also offer brunch cocktail specials (around $6, if I'm remembering correctly). There were several cute dogs accompanying their humans for brunch, but sadly, there was nothing on the menu was intended for them. Every time someone accidentally dropped some food, the dogs got really excited.We started with a couple bellinis, but the peach puree seemed to be lacking slightly. The bubbles were still refreshing though. John ordered the Fromage Omelet ($8.75) with pommes frites on the side. I had a bite of the omelet, and that fontina cheese was yummy, but so rich! I don't think I could have finished that entire omelet all by myself.Unfortunately, there was mix up with my order. I had ordered the Eggs Florentine ($9.75) with Lyonnaise potatoes on the side. The waiter first brought me an omelet with the potatoes, then went back to the kitchen to fix my order. He then came out with Eggs Florentine with fries, as well as a comped cocktail. Since they were already giving me a free cocktail and were incredibly apologetic about the wait, I didn't want to mention that I actually wanted potatoes, not fries. It's all good, and the fries were tasty. I typically judge a restaurant's brunch based on their Eggs Benedict-type dishes, and Elysian Cafe hit the mark, especially for the price. Lots of spinach, perfectly poached eggs, a nice hollandaise sauce. Perhaps next time I'll finally try the Lyonnaise potatoes.

Came with a large side salad. Fries were cold but they brought out hot ones. Dog friendly inside the patio. Most places have you keep the dog on the sidewalk.

I just needed caffeine to start my day and it was at a decent time in the afternoon to start drinking beer. Service was quick and staff were friendly.

I guess they had run out of the wine we requested.  It seems like a reasonable person would have asked if we preferred a different bottle, and explained they had to go off campus for a different bottle, which would have been fine.  We picked that wine randomly anyway.She came back to the table 2-3 more times.  The first two times she did not say one word; she brings the wine, throws the glasses on the table, has us taste it, and leaves, all without a word. She then tried to be friendly when bringing us our dessert menus, but the damage was done.  The best part was when another waitress brought us our desserts and explained our previous waitress had left.  She probably knew she wasn't getting a great tip and cut her losses.  Keep in mind we had ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and two bottles of wine, so her tip would have been substantial at our standard 25%.We paid the bill and I decided to run our experience by the manager, young guy, curly hair. I explained we had already paid and didn't want a discount, we just wanted to make him aware of the waitresses behavior. He basically said ""I told her to go get the wine from Amanda's, guess she was having a bad day. Sorry.""  And that was about it.  About as socially aware as the waitress.Sincerely one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.  We won't be back.  Go a half block away, grab a bottle of wine, and spend your money at Anthony David's.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

We met up with our friends who also have two boys. I was pleased with their draft beer list, which included Żywiec, a Polish lager that's not easy to find in Hoboken. I got the Steak Au Poivre cooked rare. I thought it was cooked a little more than rare but that's okay. The meat wasn't a great piece of meat because it had more gristle than I'd like but I didn't want to make a fuss. The sauce was really tasty. The wife got the braised short ribs which I enjoyed more than my own dish. But again, I've had better short ribs. They weren't as juicy/moist as some of the better short ribs I've had but maybe I'm just not familiar with a French-style braised short rib. They had a few options for the kid's meals which was nice. My boys ended up getting chicken fingers and fries, which they seemed to enjoy.The one thing I really had an issue with was the audacity of the people without kids to show up on Tuesday night, which everyone in Hoboken knows is kids eat free night at Elysian Cafe. You sit there with your overpriced mixed cocktail with your date, trying to make the best of the crappy situation. Dude, you failed at doing your research on a romantic date spot. Look, there are plenty of other places in Hoboken, even just a few blocks from Elysian Cafe, that are better date places: Stingray Lounge, Bin 14, Anthony David's, etc. You deserve to get dumped for taking your date to Elysian Cafe on kids eat free night. I'm not sure I'd come back here for dinner. For the price, I think the quality isn't great. Maybe it's a better value for brunch? I'd rather just go to Anthony David's if I'm going to pay this much.

The crowd was a nice mix of older folk with younger kids and there were a few college B-Ball games playing out on the screens above the bar.  Feeling slightly hungry, I eventually ordered the highly praised French Onion soup, which was a delicious warm-up on such a cold and windy day.Eventually, I somehow ended up getting free shots of Jameson and talking sports with the group of lively gentlemen next to me, an unexpected, yet entertaining way to cap off the afternoon.

The french like decor, and amazing menu made this the place for a celebratory lunch. We sat outside. The wait staff was amazing. Super friendly and on their a game. I went with the salmon club. Thick layers of salmon with avocado and a creme like topping, sandwiched between white toast. There was so much salmon, I couldn't even eat it all. Was a little too much. To be honest. It came with salad or fries, I went with a salad that was plentiful. $13.75.My guest ordered the lunch special: French Onion Soup and Roast Beef Poivre sandwich (1/2). Amazing. The French Onion soup came out in a mug with steaming, melted cheese everywhere. I sampled it and was a pretty damn good taste. Her roast beef sandwich was large though it was only half and it looked phenomenal. All this for a price tag of $9. I would definitely get this option next time.

As for the food - The key lime pie is quite yummy.  The cod entree is always a reliable choice and seems to change seasonally as to the risotto and accompany sauce.

Good to see you again.On Sunday (06/22), my boyfriend and I stopped here for a way-too-late-meal-to-be-considered-brunch (it was just after 3 when we got there), and since the weather was absolutely gorgeous, we decided to sit outside. Our server (I think his name was John) came out almost immediately and seemed quite amused at my boyfriend's lack of decisiveness, but he was a genuinely nice guy and made some very astute suggestions on what to order (he dismissed the croquette as ""just a ham sandwich"" and praised the steak sandwich to the skies).For our entrees, I decided on the smoked salmon club, which was an impressive set of four small triple-decker sandwiches with huge helpings of delicious salmon, avocado, dill sauce, and fresh lettuce. I assumed I would get the pommes frites as my side, but I was surprised when John offered the option of salad instead, so I went with that and was rewarded with a hearty portion of vibrant romaine and red leaf lettuce, drizzled in a balsamic reduction dressing. I also had a glass of Cabernet with my meal, which helped bring out the smoky flavor of the salmon. My boyfriend ordered the highly recommended Elysian Steak Sandwich and was quite pleased with it. I tried a piece of the steak and liked it; it was cooked medium but was not chewy or hard.  I willed myself to stay away from his pommes frites, however. Those things should come with a warning label for extreme deliciousness.I'm glad to see The Elysian Cafe step up its game from my last visit, and I will definitely be back for more good food.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

But it's a great, charming place to get gourmet variety in Hobokes.  I came here on a Monday w/ 2 gfs.  No res needed- around 7:30 it wasn't too packed, but we had to sit in one of the bar tables (kinda cramped). What's amazing about Elysian is that on Mondays they do a 2 for 1 special from the bar menu, where the lowest price entree is free! :).  My two friends ordered wine, which I think was $7-9 (they have happy hour though, 4-7!)Portions are huge here!  The service is great too- our waitress was nice and checked up on us.  Our food took a little while to come out though.  My one friend and I ordered the Moule Frites in White Wine Garlic Sauce w/ Pomme Frites.  The mussels could have been a bit..fresher (they were a bit rubbery?) but overall, this was very good. I loved the white wine garlic sauce.  It was so good with the pieces of garlic bread that came with it.  The meh item was the fries- they were skinny McDonald's-y fries that could have been better salted/seasoned but fortunately..they weren't too greasy. They were actually a bit dry.  Overall, the dish was a lot of food for $14. Our other friend ordered a french onion soup (very cheesy and plentiful).  This is one of their specialties, I think.  She then got the Chicken Club sandwich with salad, which was so big she had to pack one half for later! :) Bar entrees are in the mid teens- very reasonable for the food you get.  But for the more gourmet items, you can try their Dinner Menu which features steak, roasted chicken breast, and really nice fish.  Their menu has so much variety that I'd definitely come back to try it again- esp. for this Monday special :D The place has a larger dining room that is suitable for groups and dates.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

She responded, ""he just requested that table in the shade"".  I had requested it fifteen minutes ago.  Defeated I walked to my seat in the microwave.  Upset and starting to sweat, I couldn't order.  I could see that my guest was also not amused by the charade that was going on neither.  I told her that we were leaving as I put on my coat.  Nothing could prepare me for what happened next.We were both shaking our heads about the lack of concern and direct disregard to change tables as I see a waitress running after me with a guest check.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  she wanted money for club soda.  Water with carbon dioxide in it? Really????  I know that she didn't want the money...It was the scumbag managers so I wouldn't be too hard on her for doing her job.I asked her if she is serious and opened my wallet and asked her if a $5 bill would cover it?  Never EVER again with this low life establishment!  You do not treat a customer like shit and chase him for money for water with bubbles in it..DISGUSTING!  Also the bathroom is gross, and I never eat a place with a dirty bathroom.   The cooks relieve themselves in that same bathroom with no paper towels.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

Yum! The salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the smoked salmon was not too smoked/fishy tasting, so you know it was fresh. I could have stood for more hollandaise sauce on top though. The french toast was also very yummy. It was a little dry, but the maple syrup took care of that!

Back in the day, before we tried them, I think my boyfriend and I avoided it for that reason. One day we went for lunch or brunch and we've been addicted ever since. We circle the block desperately looking for a parking spot in Hoboken even on a cold winter's day just so we can eat there.We feel acceptable arriving in t-shirt and jeans. I noticed the other day the hostess was dressed very casually. The interior is classy. Old fashioned antique ceilings. The thick dramatic curtain in front of the door always impressed me. Makes you feel less like a pig when you're stuffing a cheeseburger into your face. A pig with a pearl necklace on.I can't remember ever having an issue with the wait staff. They've always been pleasant.Their prices for most menu items are okay but they can be a little steep for certain items. We usually come for brunch when they have a nice discount on drinks. I recommend their Bloody Mary. Their coffee has been enjoyed by me many times. I've had the Steak and Eggs, Eggs Florentine, Eggs Benedict, Egg White Omelet, Salmon Eggs Benedict...I might be missing one. All delicious. Pick the french fries over the lyonnaise potatoes though--sad looking and not a lot of taste to them. The french fries are DIVINE. Think high class McDonald's fries. One time we went crazy and ordered the cheese plate. I don't think we'll do it again any time soon because it cost $12 but we did enjoy it.We came for dinner a time or two. I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon one of those times. Really delicious. Their burger is also great even though it's bigger than my head and I have a hard time eating it without looking ridiculous.On warm days we love to eat outdoors if there are any seats left. Elysian Cafe is always busy when we come on the weekends. Lately we've been seated in the back area. The first time it smelled like sweat back there for some reason. I couldn't help but keep thinking that the guys in the kitchen must be sweating profusely and I was smelling their bodies. It didn't help my appetite. There were little kids nearby though...maybe they were the smelly ones. While we're on the topic of kids I don't understand why people bring small children here. The restaurant welcomes them...but I don't think they should. Not because I hate kids or anything. It just doesn't seem appropriate for this kind of place? Doesn't go with the flow. A couple of times we were seated right by a table of loud brats and their self absorbed parents so that could be poisoning my judgement.Privileged Hoboken children aside we will be returning for some time to come I expect.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

I ordered eggs Benedict which came out tepid.  The potatoes which were recommend were dry and inedible.  My partner ordered a Croque Madame which turned out to be an egg sandwich also served almost cold.  The most lively part of this restaurant was the banter among the servers talking about their previous nights entertainment.  Needless to say I will never go here again.  If you're smart you'll stay away also.,Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

This cafe (which is a sister restaurant with Amanda's just down the street) is a beautiful little spot to grab a weekend brunch and just relax.  The decor in the building is beautiful, with rich ornamentation and gorgeous cerulean walls. It was also surprisingly spacious since after seeing the outside seating, I imagined the indoors to be even smaller!The boyfriend and I were yet again on the brunch exploration. I ordered my staple: eggs florentine. And man, this place did it right. The hollandaise was creamy and tangy. The eggs were poached perfectly. The spinach delish. What was a bit different, however, was that it came with pommes frites instead of the more typical hash browns or home fries. When I bit into them, however, I didn't care. Those were some delicious French fries.After sipping some coffee for a while (also good), we got the bill which was meh. Not cheap, not expensive, right about where it should be.

213,krGhEGcZoGIXNxGU_xl3uw,Carrie W.,1.0 star rating,"I was excited to take my family here, but unfortunately, we had a really disappointing experience at the Elysian Cafe last night.Knowing it can get crowded on the weekends, we had walked in the night before to make reservations. The hostess wrote my name, time of reservations, and group number down on her pad of paper.On Saturday, we show up prior to our 7pm reservations. I approach the hostess and tell her we have reservations for five at 7pm. She immediately tells me they do not take reservations for fewer than six on Saturday nights. I explained to her I had not been informed of that policy and the hostess the night before had told us we were good to go. She tells me to wait and goes inside to get her manager. A couple minutes later, the manager walks out to speak with me explaining that they do not have record of me in their system and again, that they don't make reservations for less than six people. Rather than being apologetic or accommodating for the error, he continued to make excuses and push the blame onto me (and his hostess from the night before) for their mistake.  Not yet wanting to give up, I asked how long the wait was. He informed me there was no wait for the outside (it was getting chilly out), but a thirty minute wait for the inside because they ""had reservations."" Apparently the reservation I made the night before was not worth honoring or acknowledging. Annoyed with the lack of customer service and the manager's smugness, we decided to not give them our business.I can thank them though.

The service was good all night, they had 2 different people working our table to ensure we had everything we needed. Our waitress was very attentive and made some key recommendations for us. The ambience was probably one of my favorites and we werent even outside on the adorable patio surrounded by a lush garden on the sidewalks of hoboken. Food wise we had the crispy calamari salad (packed with flavor) and the goat cheese and beat salad (if you like those kinds of salads dont miss this one). Their Pomme Frites were definitely worth ordering. Dinners were a hit with everyone all around which included the salmon, seafood stew, and a few of the steak choices. Dont miss this place!

Here's the kicker though - soft drinks weren't  included either.  So if you wanted seltzer water - $3.  Two coffees?  Extra.  Soda?  extra.  It just absolutely killed me that they nickel and dimed EVERYTHING.  So by the time all was said and done, it ended up being $60/head on average.Oh but that wasn't all.  The food was absolutely disappointed.  Like ""braised short rib?""  Yeah, if I wanted beef stew I would have just gone to my mom's for NYE.  We ordered a shrimp cauliflower bisque as our appetizer...it was 2 pieces of SMALL shrimp (to their credit, not ""baby""), with a cauli puree over it.  I was all - what?  And the dessert was a chocolate peanut butter tart, which was a fancy phrase for ""Giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.""The best part?  After all was said and done?  As we walked home, I turned to my SO and said - are you still hungry?  He nodded emphatically.  We had to get Benny tudino's to go on the way home!  Ridick!  Spending $120 on overrated food and beverages (regardless of whether they were ""adult"") and then have to get pizza.  Yeah, I lived near Elysian for three years, and it left such a bad impression on me, I never returned.  I also made it a point the next year to just skip the hullabaloo and order from Benny's.  Now I just make my own dinner that night.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

Maybe it is the ambiance, with stained glass windows, damask-style wall relief, and their mahogany bar, what is not to like. I am certain the owner takes great pride in every detail they chose for this place - this intricacy is reflected in their food as well. Take their french onion soup, my brother tried this dish from every restaurant we went to in Montreal, then we came to Elysian and he exclaims it is the best he has ever had. Is it the broth, the crostini, or the cheese, I will never know. Yet, it is now six months later, and he still cannot stop talking about it. This is my favorite brunch in Hoboken, hands down. I think it was the fromage omelet that did it for me, but then there is also the salmon benedict. No, definitely the cinnamon-amaretto french toast. See, as I am recollecting all of this I am making myself hungry at 10:50 pm - now imagine yourself  ""unwinding"" from a great Friday night here. You may not even speak a word of French, and suddenly you will find yourself OOoouuu-ing and AAAahhh-ing.

I wasn't blown away by anything here, but the dishes were well executed and the options and prices were good. My salmon eggs benedict was good but needed salt and pepper, particularly for the hollandaise (good texture but bland). The salmon was just okay - I think it could have been fresher, especially considering that every table I observed ordered at least one of the salmon benedict dishes. My friend's eggs florentine dish was similar - good but a bit bland. The lyonaisse potatoes (think thick potato chips that aren't super crispy) were nothing fabulous but were well prepared, and the pommes frittes were also good but underwhelming. I'll put it this way: everything was prepared properly, but USE SEASONING PEOPLE!!Service almost brought this up to 4 stars. The servers were attentive despite how busy they were and were on the ball.  We sat outside, which was hot since we were seated in the sun, although most people were shaded by umbrellas. The seats were wobbly and the tables were tightly packed outside, such that you were sitting with all of your neighbors and sharing your conversations.

It's better straight up lunch and dinner. The service is much better for dinner as well. I will say that they have a solid menu. It won't blow you away but you won't be underwhelmed either. The prices for Hoboken are actually on the more reasonable side which is surprising considering the decor is upscale.I will say I've been dragged there a few times for brunch and the $3 champagne special is good but each time the service was sucky. Too many patrons and not enough service staff. Also way too many dogs and kids crammed in the outdoor section running around with parents sipping mimosas and not paying any attention to them. So I'm not going to say it's amazing but for Hoboken it ain't bad either.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

There was a crowd gathered out front of maybe 8-10ppl but we were seated right away.  Outdoor seating, the inside seemed to have a little wait The outdoor cafe is beautiful we were seated under a magnificent tree and had plenty of shade. The brunch menu had something for everybody from lobster rolls and burgers to French Toast and different egg platters.  I got the chicken Caesar salad and was very impressed. Also picked at the fries I shared with my daughter. .so good soo good.The brunch drink options were very cheap, I got a screwdriver for less than 6$.Food came fast,  service with a smile and oh so tasty.

Hoboken Brunch is already a fail but decided to treck here since it was one of the top rated ones in Hoboken.  What a dissapointment right from putting our name in -- Hostess forgot it twice and we waited twice as long to get a table-probably waited longer than we actually spent in there. So, the premise of this review is that we had a bad start. THey DID get us free mimosas to make up for this mishap, that was a good move, thank you.Food is pretty darn cheap here for brunch so I'll give them that. Settled on the salmon eggs benedict--it was just meh, whatever. Such a sad sad plating of the dish since the Fries bucket dominated the plate. Highlight of the food was probably the fries which tasted like McDonalds but I""m gonna go out on a whim and say they were the frozen kind.Recommendation: try any other place in Hoboken and forget bout this spot.  Even some sports bars have better food/selection.  If I'm caught getting brunch in HB again it'll be at Sabores or La Isla.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

This must be a great place to hang out in, late at night, listening to Serge Gainsbourg sipping on an old fashioned or something French.I ordered the Egg white omelette, with spinach, tomato & goat cheese with pommes frittes, the eggs were fluffy but a little greasy, they could have put a little more goat cheese, the fries were awesome. I also ordered the cafe creme, very good flavor and fresh.My fiancee ordered, blueberry pancakes, really sweet and tart, not sure if they used fresh blueberries, I recommend ordering the bacon ""well done,"" she got it perfectly cooked but another person in our group did not order it that way and it was greasy and flappy.My one gripe is that when we ask for some butter, they brought out little butter pre-wrapped butter squares and not a small tin of fresh/whipped butter. Seems like a dumb thing to ask for, but it's just a small detail that shouldn't be overlooked in a French bistroWith 4 entrees, 1 mimosa, 2 coffees & 1 OJ, it came out to $70 with tip & we left full.Great experience, will return for dinner at least once.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

But not this place, the food was made like it should be, classic and usual. I was drinking Margaritas like they were going out of style and they were awesome! The bartenders were very attentive but not as personable for my liking, then again, the bar was packed. The only other thing I want to comment on is the confusion of waiting...almost always a wait, one line...but you never know if that que is for a table inside, the outdoor seating or the bar itself...we usually just bypass the line and go straight to the bar...so far no one has ever said anything to us, so I don't think we are doing anything wrong or inconsiderate.

257,CAqvbzH_fgCiGJS6kmyIgw,Annie D.,4.0 star rating,"Happy hour is just a lil' bit happier at Elysian. Especially on Mondays. Why, you ask? Because from 5-7 p.m. in the bar, it's a compounded special time with their HH (half-price house wine, beer and cocktails) AND their Monday night 2-4-1 bar entree deal. That's like, a middle manager's salary worth of discount.Their house wine includes any $7 glass on the menu, so it  gives you more of a choice than the typical one white and one red that I'm used to. I had the sauvignon blanc for my first glass, but soon switched over to the vinho verde after a sip of my BFF's glass. And the bartenders betrayed no judgment when we drank our way through the good part of a bottle and a half of that crisp, summery Portuguese wine... at $3.50 per glass.For eats, we shared the mussels/frites and the calamari. I'd recommend the calamari in a heartbeat.The calamari is so crispy and seasoned perfectly, with kalamata olives, tomato and arugula on top. So it's almost a salad, right? A fat salad. The mussels were tasty too, but I wasn't that impressed with the frites. The French menu isn't fancy French---just regular person French. That carries on in the vintage decor and atmosphere as well. There's a corner sidewalk patio, a casual bar area and a slightly nicer dining area. Though it's ornately decorated, none of it's stuffy.Other Tips:1. This Monday night entree deal is listed as a winter thing only on their website, but we got it on Memorial Day so I don't know.2. The bartenders were awesome, but two of the other staff members who greeted us were not very helpful when we directly asked them if happy hour is only in the bar area (it was). They were just like, ""Sit wherever you want..."" So we did, and then the wait assistant let us know that HH is just in the bar... so we moved.3.

Two of us dined at the Elysian Cafe after having only moved to the area. We ate on a Monday evening, drawn by the possibility of eating outside on the sidewalk. Added bonus - the Elysian offers 2-for-1 dishes on their bar menu. Or, do they.....read on.We ordered 2 things from the bar menu (only so we could have the 2-for-1) -- the French onion soup and the garlic fries. The French onion soup was passable, but the garlic fries were pretty ordinary.For small entrees, we had the grilled octopus, mac-n-cheese, and arugula salad.The mac-n-cheese was decent, but nothing remarkable.The arugula salad -- well, let's use air quotes around the word arugula here. The greens were dried out and starting to turn. The goat cheese was dumped straight from a plastic pouch. And the beets were sliced straight OUT OF A CAN. CANNED BEETS, what!?The octopus was overcooked, tough, and bland. And, gave us tummy aches.Then, when we're already just disappointed, we get the bill and there is an error. We politely tell the server that she has charged us for both of our bar items, even though it's Monday and they should be 2-for-1. She says that only SOME of the bar items are involved with that special. We did make a small stink about this, asking her to clarify which items were part of the special and which weren't, and she didn't seem to care about explaining this to us, and certainly did not make an offer to make us happy.We will NEVER come here again.

I first ate brunch here 3 years ago while shopping around for Condo's and remember being pleasantly surprised. After a long hiatus (for reasons I cannot explain) we went back on Fri night for dinner. Holy $#!t does this place work like a well oiled machine. We started our meal with a few kumamoto oysters and the ""maryland"" style crab cake. The oysters were fresh and tasty, and the crab cake, although not a true lump crab cake was very, very tasty. With our apps we had a few drinks. I'm not sure what my GF got, but it had something to do with Grey Goose Pear and a lemon twist - it was almost too refreshing (I would drink 100 of them), and I had a Makers Mark Manhattan - it was very well made. Moving on to dinner - We both had glasses of the Code du Rhone Merlot. My GF got the braised beef short rib. It was cooked to perfection and spiced very well. The presentation of the dish was excellent, making it both visually and taste pleasing. I got the brined pork chop. Man was it cooked to perfection, and HUGE to. The taste from the brine was outstanding, and the brussel sprouts were like crack... Seriously, I don't even like brussel sprouts.For desert we had the mint chocolate chip sundae, which was insane, needless to say.Seriously though it was beyond the food that made this place. It just has all the right attributes. You walk in to a dimly lit dining room with a long, fully packed bar. As you pass through the front room into the back you get a completely different atmosphere from the front. And I don't mean that in a bad way. The floor is covered in vintage black and white bathroom tile, and the ceiling has the most intricate patterns that just compliment the structure. You feel like you've been tossed back to the 20s. On top of all of this, as soon as you sit down they bring you water. I know you're all thinking that's not impressive, but if you live in Hoboken you understand that there is more mediocre service here than anything, and sometimes getting glasses of water is a task in itself. The waiter was knowledgable of the menu and gave good recommendations, and the staff were super friendly and efficient - making sure we didn't sit in our own filth.

We've been there 3 times within a 24 hour period on numerous occasions. I should start checking in, I'd be the mayor (errr, I mean duke) in a week. We mostly come for drinks, usually late night after the dinner crowd has left.  They have a great rotating selection of beers on tap, and Doug is the best bartender in Hoboken.  The food is great. Brunch is probably better than dinner, but I've always been happy with whatever I order. My favorite is the calamari salad.  But most importantly, and what keeps me coming back, is the people there. It's fair to say I'm a regular, so I may be bias. But I think a good barometer of a local restaurant is how they treat their regulars, even if I'm not one.

We were seated in the main dining room (lit by candles - hello mood lighting). The waitress was apologetic that all they had was stuffed rigatoni with red sauce as if it would be the worst thing we could possibly eat. Let me tell you - that meal was the highlight of my week. I got my first hot meal AND a glass of wine (or two) in 4 days! The huge plate of pasta and wine was $5 each. It was cheaper and better than some of the date nights I've had. I meant to send them a Christmas card thanking them for their hospitality and warm atmosphere during that week, but I forgot to (oops!) - I'll just leave them a stellar review here instead. I've had the skirt steak, braised beef short ribs, cheese plate and steak au poivre - all which I would recommend to a friend. They've consistently had great service and food.

Not sure why.When we asked for the other half, it did not come out right away and when we realized how long it was taking we asked the server to make the half to go since we no longer wanted it due to the time factor it took.We ordered unsweetened Iced tea and asked for a refill. The server had already put our bill on the table and pulled it back once we asked for a refill to add the request to the bill.  I am not sure if this is their policy to charge for refills, but we went along with it.   When the ice tea came back, it was sweetened and at that time we told the server to remove it from our bill to adjust the charge for the second Iced tea.  The server took the bill back.  It came back and I had a gift card in the amount of $100.00 that I was using to pay.  The bill came to $28.36 and I gave the server the gift card along with the bill and advised her she needed to remove the $2.50 charge.  She said she would take care of it.When the server came back, she had my gift card all written on with her figures on how much to write back on the gift card as my final balance. We wondered why she did write the math right on this Gift card  and not figure it out on a separate piece of paper.  The server came back and we noticed the Extra charge for the $2.50 was not taken off.  She insisted to us it was and she stood on that.  I asked her to look my orig bill before the $2.50  charge was taken off and look at the total left on my gift card   and the gift card balance showed the full amount taken off which included the iced tea we sent back.  She again insisted she took it The amount off and went back inside and came out with a slip which looked like a credit in the amount of $2.68 (I assume tax added back)  I told her that was ok, but show me on the Gift card where you gave this back to me.  She could not explain any further or did not understand so I asked for the Manager.   In a few minutes the manager showed up and we explained the situation and he understood and apologized for the issue and he would take care of it.  the manager came back and all they did was to remove the $2.50 charge and issue me a new gift card with the balance remanding.The bottom line is....bad service and a the servers understanding the requests.and getting food and drink order wrong",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

For the appetizer we ordered their Mussels in white wine sauce, and I think they beat any mussels I tried before, or after for that matter! Make sure to ask them for a spoon, because you sure would want to drink that white wine sauce! 1 portion is good for 2 people. For the mains, I ordered their crispy calamari salad, and my brother ordered their famous Pastrami Reuben. I enjoyed my salad very much, but once I tried Pastrami Reuben I was simply blown away. Juicy, tender, flavourful and absolutely delicious! A must try for pastrami fans!

This is my usual routine and I like it best when the restaurant is low key, low pretention. The food is fancy enough, the service is thoughtfully quick and the over all tone can be obnoxious with questionable live music or with easy jazz in the background.

The pomme frittes come in a cute tin on your plate and the eggs have been cooked well each time.  I'm not a fan of hollaindaise sauce, and they made sure to not include it (sometimes people forget about sauce and dressings and it's always sad to have to ask them to re-make).  They open at 10am on Sundays and seem to get pretty busy after 11 or so.  Definitely head up there for the early rush!",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

He had an attitude straight away.  After giving us the wine list, proceeded to stand their while we made our choice.  Who doe this?  The bus boy, Anthony, was far more attentive so I made sure I handed him a tip.

I have returned to Elysian Cafe to see if my second experience will be as good as my first. Well, YES! Started with Cote du Rhone bottle of red that is fabulous, appetizer of calamari in a salad that I just can't tell you how delicious. Fried calamari can be easily ruined, they managed to create a masterpiece salad, served with dandelion, Parmesan, and olives.

Yesterday I finally tried it out. On the positive side, we (4 of us) were able to have that relaxing day and were not rushed at all. We drank some cocktails, finished those while we caught up with each other, then ordered some more cocktails and a few appetizers, and when those were done, another round and our entrees. It really was nice and relaxing, which is just what we were looking for in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food was remarkably bad. We ordered 18 oysters to start. While the flavor of the oysters was not bad, all (12) of the small kumamoto oysters had bits of chipped shell in them, rendering them impossible to slosh down or chew. Also they were $2.85 each which is pretty pricey. My entree was short ribs over saffron rice with a side of fries. Now when I eat unhealthy I'm consciously making the decision to satisfy my taste buds to the dismay of my waistline. What I hate is when both my waistline AND my tastebuds are unhappy. The meat had absolutely no flavor and way too much fat that hadn't rendered off. The fries were tasteless as well which is a shame at a brasserie-style restaurant. One of my companions had the steak frites (which i tried) and we both agreed that it was totally tasteless and overcooked. The cut of beef itself was very low quality, probably a select cut (below prime and choice). It was seasoned and cooked worse than your beginner home cook can do. Another companion who is a mussel aficionado thought her sauce/broth had no depth of flavor and was disappointed by the meager portion of actual mussels. On a side note, none of us had the lobster roll but we did spy our neighbor eating one. I am ALL ABOUT lobster rolls and it says something that I didn't order it after seeing hers. The roll looked weak and didn't seem like it could stand up to the filling. The lobster itself was more shredded and torn that I'd like. It really should be chunks of lobster with a light dab of homemade mayo. Now I hate being so negative and being a downer, but damn I'm just tellin it like it is!Now it's call out time! :) I have NO FREAKIN IDEA how you fellow yelpers give this place an average of 4 stars.

I don't know if the person below me had a different chef or the restaurant was just having an off day, but when I ordered it, it was not greasy. I thought it was well cooked, and they gave a generous amount of calamari compared to the majority of other restaurants I have ordered this from. My boyfriend had the Pastrami Sandwich. It was huge. He usually finishes my leftovers for me, but this sandwich filled him up, so much that he couldn't! The second time I went, I had the Mussels in White Wine and shared a pitcher of Sangria. These mussels are amazing particularly because the white wine broth is delicious. The Sangria was enough to fill 5-6 glasses for $20 which is a steal compared to the price in the city. Nothing to special about the sangria though. It was just nice to sip on with the meal and in between conversation.  Don't be fooled by the prices! Although it may seem to be one of those fancy restaurants where you still leave hungry, the portions are very generous. They have a separate menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Will definitely come here again when I'm in the area :) TIP: On Monday nights, they have a special where they remove the lowest priced bar menu item!

It was a fairly crowed Sunday afternoon, we sat right down, and ordered our meal, two cheese burgers please! Our burgers arrived in a timely manner, but both our burger buns were stale, and crumbly, and our frites? Limp and cold, I asked for another iced tea, it came without ice. I would have normally complained, if I weren't for a decent pickle, I don't think it fair to dismiss a restaurant when you've had some good meals in the past, but It was such a let down, I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, at least not for a burger.",Elysian Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, French,, Bars"

My main dish which was the Skirt Steak was very nicely prepared and cooked to my preference.The main 2 reasons why we gave this a two star rating was because upon going to enjoy a nice Malbec from Argentina, I found a bug inside the Wine, mind you this was not a fruit fly, it was a small cockroach looking insect. Obviously I shared this with the waiter, and they quickly replaced the Wine but at no moment did they request to offer to take this off the bill. The money is not an issue here, but when something like this happens, you at least expect the manager come out an apologize and offer the Wine on the house. This wasn't done at all and it seemed like an everyday thing and I was wrong for having mentioned it.Secondly, my fiancees Lobster Roll came on a regular ""wonder bread"" , and accompanied by some  cold French Fries and a salad.

Maybe we should have thought better than to order shellfish at a bar-ish type place-- neither was bad per se, but the oysters were lacking/slightly gritty and the mussels failed to impress. Bottom line: opt for different appetizers.I had a dirty grey goose martini which was mostly just vodka (fine by me, I guess), but not the best cocktail I've had either. As an entree, I had the Alaskan Cod Fillet w/ Sweet Corn Risotto, Parmesan Broth, & Roasted Red Peppers based on our server's recommendation. This actually was really delicious. The fish was well-cooked, as was the risotto. Despite including risotto, it did not sit heavy at all and was portioned just right. My boyfriend had a soft-shell crab sandwich they had as a special and he said it was good.

Fully restored to it's pre-war turn of the centyry glory, it is beautiful not only to look at but it is worth it for a fresh French style Bistro. The menu is small but varies from Mussels & Pommes Frites in a White Wine-Garlic broth to Warm Roast Beef 'Au Poivre'. An appropriate Beer selection to go along with the eats, and outdoor seating, make this cafe a stand out. I wish other restaurants in Hoboken would put forward such a complete effort as this.

The food was excellent. Good Wine too.The service seemed a bit indifferent at first but the food and drinks came out quick enough. They left a bottle of water at our table which I liked but someone kept coming back to refill my glass which was not really required. Maybe I am just being over-critical. They could definitely do better in the service dept. is what I though.We arrived a bit late (around 9:30 ish) and would have loved to be seated outside but the server politely told us that Hoboken had some strict curfew hours for outside seating. I would have enjoyed my meal more if we sat outside just because it was a nice evening. Yet when we left there were people sitting outside and enjoying their meal.

The eggs benedict was standard, nothing to set it apart.

They tried to seat us at 3 bar tables (each fits 2 people) in the crowded bar area. I explained that we all wanted to sit together, hence my reservation for 8 people. They suggested that we wait outside and asked us if we would like a bottle of wine while we waiting for a table in the restaurant. (it was 90* outside mind you, and no standing room inside) An hour later a table was available. A few of our orders were wrong (which normally doesn't bother me that much). However, when the bill came the bottle of wine we were offered was added to our bill. When I mentioned this to the manager he was incredibly rude and stated that we could have sat at the 3 bar tables, and therefore it was ""our choice"" to wait, and anything we drank while we waiting was also our choice to add to our bill. No apology and no discount or bottle of wine. I was not impressed with the service OR response by the manager. A simple sorry goes a long way.

I went to Elysian during lunch hours and also this past Mothers Day. The wait was about 30-40 minutes for first available seating. After the long wait, we were seating in the outdoor section. The chairs outside are basically patio furniture, without the soft cushion. You will be sitting on very hard aluminum chairs if you decide to dine outside. Now for the food: I decided to order what I thought would be a steak omelette; traditionally strips of steak with eggs. Instead, the meal was presented as scrambled eggs with a big, thick chunk of steak on the side. Good luck cutting and tearing into this tough chunk of meat. There was nothing tender about it, and was actually rather laborious to even eat. Portions are usually small at this place, but that of course depends on what you're ordering.
