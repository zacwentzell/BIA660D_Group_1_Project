1,2m3p7r_aURIx3ppfKSU6fg,Breelyn M.,3.0 star rating,"It's a cute bar, nice ambiance. I'll definitely check it out in the summer to visit the backyard.Parking in the heights is pretty crappy but it is what it is.Nice selection of beers however I do think this place might be way overpriced. The bartender also gave me a really bad vibe. It was clear that he was super friendly to certain customers and not so much to others but then again he seemed to be drinking also.Oh and the pizza was good, but not worth raving about.",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
2,3qeP8QXid1ZAiUc4Itb6-g,Hans M.,5.0 star rating,"Update!: came here for lunch.  Kyle the bartender is awesome.  Legit craft cocktails have been coming out of the woodwork, super great customer service and delicious pizza.  I also had a beer and a Manhattan.  Others had other craft cocktails and are raving about them.  Baby (18 mos old)came with us and was welcomed without issue.  I am definitely going to come here more this winter.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood.  I'm happy about the craft cocktails and decent beer selection.  Also, the design is very nice and very welcoming.  They have a tv for football Sunday but they aren't going for the sports bar vibe.  The bar on a whole is definitely a hit and a vast improvement over its predecessor. However, the backyard is a miss.  It's basically a baggo/ tailgate toss court surrounded by benches and some chairs.  I can't understand why there aren't some outdoor sofas, patio sets etc out there.  Don't get me wrong, I love backyard games and would definitely get into some baggo.  However, I would stay longer, order more and relax if they set up the backyard.    Maybe I'm off here but I went there to hang in the backyard, when I wasn't comfortable I finished my 1 beer, 1 appetizer and left.  I will definitely go back for drinks all winter but on a nice day I would rather walk down to the Hutton even though I live basically across the street from LOFI.",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
3,v_O09rydDza5fayXJYTDqg,Taylor M.,5.0 star rating,"Wonderful addition to the heights. Has a Brooklyn vibe, and the bar is always lowkey poppin. The bartenders do a great job with creative specialty cocktails, and the Detroit style truffle pizza is banginnnn. Perfect neighborhood spot we frequent at least once or twice a week. Props to LoFi!",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
4,Ralo7wlSbCF5IM3Z46y8PA,Yeraldine S.,4.0 star rating,"#LowFidelity or #LoFi is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. I definitely agree with Bloss that this spot has more of a casual, laidback feel, compared to the Archer (which i also like)  I stopped by on a Saturday night and it was a fun time. The bartender was super friendly and he made me a solid ""Kentucky Morning"" -$12 (bourbon, peach liqueur , honey, bitters). My coworker was also a fan of her ""El Diablo"" drink. I can't wait to try more of their cocktails (I've been stalking their Instagram page).We decided to try their Detroit Style pizza -we went for the Motor City (red sauce) and a white sauce one but can't remember the name -too much bourbon, My friend who was visiting from Detroit confirmed that the pizza was legit and verified it Detroit style :) We ended up in the backyard playing cornhole and it got pretty competitive. They also have a nice, well-priced beer list that also gets thumbs up from us. All in all, LowFidelity offered great drinks, a delicious simple-menu, and kick-ass service.  I'll be back!

6,C8BRhiuPMZeVVtV94x7wKw,Gail E.,3.0 star rating,"So I wasVery excited to visit this new bar. Nice decor alright bartender . Only problem I have is the no cranberry orOrange Juice thing. It's still a bar should have basicNeeds .Small selection on vodka , OnlyOne cider available ;And when we askedThe Bartender what's on tap he just pointed to the menu instead of conversing . I get the vibe it'sGoing for , but still should be welcoming for everyone .",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"

8,dl4ENy4Bk6-lCu59A8vxbg,Bloss C.,5.0 star rating,"Yipee, I can walk a few blocks and get a slamming martini. From the same owners of The Archer downtown, their second location is more causal than The Archer and has a neighborhood feel already. LoFi just opened so things are being worked out but the bartenders have been great on all of my visits. They are going to have seating  in the back yard at some point, but for now they have cornhole set up which, is pretty fun.  Off their first drink menu I've tried the Expat and really liked it, I wasn't as big of a fan of the Bees Knees, but everyone else liked it. The daily punch is also good, it changes but right now they are doing a bourbon mint punch.  In the coming weeks they will open their kitchen which will not have a game themed menu like the Archer.  It did get a little loud in the space on my first visit, but it hasn't been too loud on subsequent visits. Once they are in full swing I hope they offer a happy hour like they do downtown.",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
9,5T0ZlFzC3fkmi_VKSISHLw,Scott W.,5.0 star rating,"I like it A LOT so far. $4 high life on draft. Decor is cool and doesn't try that hard (i.e, the bar isn't made from a 200 yr-old halved tree trunk that the bartender, upon orders from the higher-ups, compels himself to tell you about each time you drink there.) I don't really feel qualified to expound my views on the drinks because I like a nice light beer. That said, this place knocks the socks off the Hutton just a couple blocks away because, as I said, $4 draft beer is a must in the Heights, and the Hutton only offers Coors Light for like, idk, $5 or $6. Alas, I will save my diatribe for another venue.Playlist was good, but I mean, if your bar is gonna be called Lo Fi, you gotta pound out the tunes. I was only here for a bit under an hour, but I heard TWO Pavement songs, a Superchunk song, ""Sugarcube"" by Yo La Tengo--relics from a once-was-cool-but-doesn't-even-taste-the-same Hoboken. Pretty happy they didn't just revert to playing Lumineers Pandora like most places in the area.I'll amend my review once food gets cooking. Their kitchen isn't up yet. Also hope they decide to do happy hour, but $4 beers are fine on any occasion tbqh",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"

The bartenders make some great cocktails, I enjoy the bourbon ones, they also have $4 Miller High Life - All Day Every Day. The Pizza here is amazing (Detroit style, which you won't find anywhere else in the area) a few different options in Red and White. Outdoor patio is a good time to play cornhole and hangout in when it's nice out as well. Keep it up!",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
12,pxlfu3Zf_UzaGtpECeZLfw,Kate K.,4.0 star rating,"The drinks her are delicious and thoughtful. If you are going to pay $12 for a cocktail in Jersey City, it better be garnished and excellent and they are. They only serve Sicilian pizza and some salads. The pizza is dynamite, fluffy flavorful bread with yummy sauce. I will go back for that pizza, again, but I won't have any salad. I ordered the ""wedge"" and although it had good tastes it was a small bowl, of maybe 5 bites for $9.00. A wedge salad means you get the wedge, not a handful of lettuce. The price value is off for the wedge salad. I can't talk about any other salads because I have not tried them. But go enjoy the cocktails and pizza!",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
13,8186MgyJSj1xmpC1PB0Tvg,Aaron B.,5.0 star rating,"This place is real good. I'm real happy it's here. Love the draft beer selection, especially the evil twin brews, love the crowd on a Friday night. The pizza was awesome. Reminds me of Brooklyn which is actually refreshing because the heights has lots of potential for places like this that just never seem to hit. Hopefully this place will become a staple for the area.",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
14,dugA_rKOfCPu4Wdj5Rtt7g,Ashleigh O.,2.0 star rating,"When another reviewer said there was a limited shelf here I was apprehensive but decided to come by and see for myself. Well, in a nutshell, they weren't joking. I always order a Moscow Mule and couldn't have it here. They clearly have vodka but the ginger beer part was a no go. I've been to bars that are a hole in the wall, basically, and they still had that. I respect the minimalist vibe they're going for in a culture that is so used to having everything they want in an instant but to not even offer orange juice is a stretch.",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"

I have been waiting for this place to open for a while and they didn't disappoint!

17,LCyO3z_G3H3_yT9OeuCRGg,Megan F.,5.0 star rating,"Cool spot: great transformation from the old Trolley Car. The owners did a nice job with the interior; not too ""theme-y"" or overdone. Bar area with ~20 seats, a handful of 2 tops and a handful of 4s. Nice drink menu with average prices for JC. Kitchen isn't running yet, but the food trucks are a solid alternative. Backyard space with cornhole and some bench seating. Overall younger crowd--- which seems to be the norm in Jc--- mostly 25-40; but definitely not like a trashy frat. 5 stars since there isn't much of a reason to take any away. Looking forward to the next visit (and what their food menu might look like!).",Low Fidelity,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cocktail, Bars,, Pizza"
