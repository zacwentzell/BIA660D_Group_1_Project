My boyfriend ordered food from this location at around 6:30. The food never arrived and two hours later he called back to figure out what was going on, only to encounter the most incompetent, unhelpful, disrespectful, unprofessional, unskilled, & AMATEUR employee in the entire state of New Jersey. She had no idea what was happening or where the food was, but one thing she was capable of informing us of is that there were NO MANAGERS or DELIVERY DRIVERS working at the moment. (?????) Putting the responsibility of running the store on her was a terrible mistake on the owners part, & this became clear when she proceeded to HANG UP ON ME when I called back 30 minutes later to inquire about the whereabouts of my, now STARVING, boyfriends food. It has now been 3 hours and the food is still not here & no one has called us back. The location is now closed and our food is no where to be found. There is 0 excuse for this.

I asked if I could get ginger salad dressing and the staff told me they only had ""white sauce""-the same white sauce that goes on halal food truck food. Ugh. The teriyaki chicken was pretty underwhelming also, with chopped chicken that had a grilled flavor but was pretty cold and lacked teriyaki sauce. I think they tried to overcompensate with an overly generous serving of white rice, which took up over half of the container.
