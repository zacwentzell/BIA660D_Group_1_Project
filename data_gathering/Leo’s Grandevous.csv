1,9rr491psSOo8ZdoQmRvo3A,Inthira S.,1.0 star rating,First review on yelp ever but something needs to be said...... we were really excited to eat here since some of us have been here in the past... meals were not worth the money. Mozzarella sticks - amazing Garlic bread - tasted like toasted bread Cavatelli w broccoli (added sausage) - our cavatelli was tasteless and tasted like pasta water. The sausage was pink and tasted like a rubber glove. Couldn't even bare the taste of that sausage Carbonara - first off.. It comes w red sauce??? It would be great if the menu mentioned It wasn't carbonara but instead pasta w red sauce and bacon. Chicken francese was small and not worth the money. Gnocchi was chewy (and not in the good way) pasta sauce tasted like a jar of canned tomatoes... worse than a jar of ragu. All in all the meal was subpar. I've never left a review but the restaurant needs to keep consistency and do something about their low standards. I was really disappointed.,Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

So this was going to be an OK review but something at the end that just burns my A**... which drives this down.  Looking for a quick place in Hoboken that fit the bill this past Friday Night..  Casual, good reputation, a little atmosphere, and good food... So off we go and arrive to this well thought of place by many in the Yelp community as well as a recomendation from our concierge at our Hotel. First off I HATE HOBOKEN....  An hour to get there from Secacus because some brain surgeon decides to shut down them main artery for construction at 7PM during rush hour.... Then you get there to ""LEO's"" and there is absolutely no parking so you have to 2 blocks ""LONG BLOCKS"" to the parking garage and then walk back... Place is real quaint, big half moon type bar with real casual dining tables very old place with paper napkins... in short its not formal dining but that is OK..  Supposed to be A Sinatra place with Sinatra music, but I didn't hear anything. So we arrive and its JUMPING every table taken the bar is packed and we are seated in the back near the kitchen when a table opens and its directly under the A.C vent which now I know why nobody is sitting there... our server says no problem move to next table... which we do and are told nope can't have that one need it for a bigger party so we move again and this time it's different servers area so nobody comes to us for 15 minutes STRIKE 1.  Order some wine which was not over priced by any means the win menu was fair. Finally Grace the original Owners Grandaughter a very nice lady take our order.... Fresh bread really tasty is provided.  We order a Hot Antipasto for 2 which some things were excellent while others just ok.   The Mozerella sticks were store bought deep fried and well you get the idea, the dipping marinara was a little thin but tasty.  Baked clams were tasty but not piping hot as were the famous mussels.. clean and tasty but not hot enough.  Real winner was some of the best Eqqplant Rolotini I've ever had... Entrees....House Special tonight was a parpadella pasta with pulled short ribs in a marinara... I personally thought the pasta was over cooked and again entree was NOT piping hot Other entree which was a veal Saltamboca .. which was very good quality veal, over spinach with demi glaze and mushrooms. All good quality ingredients but sauce was very bland..  Side of Pasta no up charge angel hair with olive oil and garlic was a winner... OK so we decide to head to the bar for coffee and after dinner drink...  and here is where it gets wierd.. Grace on her way out the door I had paid the check and tipped her very nicely... walks by and says thank you ... and tells the bartender red headed girl There coffee and after dinner drinks are on me... she acknowledges this.. and then as we are leaving says its $20.00..... I mention Graces offer which by the way I didn't solicit and she just says Sorry didn't hear her.. and takes my $20.00....  Honest mistake possibly but honestly I don't think so.. Figured we were 1 timers and she'd make a quick $20.00Summing it up... if the incident at the bar hadn't happened I'd probably been a 3 star good yea I'd go back type place but after that...

My man said something about the Frank Sinatra connection and the restaurant's lengthy history/presence, but that don't mean the quality of food can be or become compromised as decades passed (that's assuming the food was finger lickin' good way back when).

I'm definitely not dying to come back here. Their famous red sauce was puzzling - why's it famous again? My chicken marsala was a bit on the salty side.

It took 30+ minutes for the salad and almost an hour for the entrees.  Oh and the order was wrong. Waiter did not acknowledge long wait or poor service.  Had to hound the bus boy for service.It's a bit disappointing as this place should be a good casual Italian restaurant but needless to say I feel it's gotten enough of an opportunity to impress and has consistently fallen flat.

When you walk in there is a bar and a few high top tables, then a good amount of tables in the back. There are pictures of Frank Sinatra everywhere (he used to eat there).  I've tried a bunch of different dishes, bar pies, salads, pasta and chicken. Everything is great but my favorite is the bolognese!!! It's to die for. The bar pies are great too, so many topping choices and very inexpensive.

The food is good but the service leaves something to be desired.  She was not only slow, she forgot was requested and seemed like she forgot about us until she walked to the kitchen, where we could see in the window she was having a grand old time only to have her walk straight out without our items.  I really hope management reads some of these reviews because this person should be retrained or put in a different position.  Ive never been so disappointed but to top the evening off, she hands our 90 year old mother the bill.  I mean really.  We sat her at the head of the table because she has problems getting in and out, but my bf and her son were seated on either side which she could have easily handed the bill to either one.  If someone wants to talk to me about this, ill gladly respond.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

17,tRQa5TTIqjCzR7rNppRLMw,Susan H.,4.0 star rating,"When I first heard of Leo's Grandevous, I was intrigued once I learned of its history.  Opened in 1939 by Leo and Tessie DiTerlizzi, it was a favorite of Frank Sinatra's.  Whenever he was in the area, he would always pay a visit, usually after hours as he enjoyed not only the food but the company of Leo and Tessie.  Here is an article that talks about all this:  nj.com/sinatra/ledger/in…We were visiting our daughter and her family for Mother's Day and decided that we would try to have dinner here.  They don't take reservations but we took our chances and showed up around 5:30 p.m.  The place was busy but they were able to put together some tables so that there was room for the 7 of us.Looking around at the customers, it was clear to see that most were older folks which I suspect were part of the BNR (born and raised) Hobokenites.  It also appeared that much of the staff was also.We found service to be friendly and efficient.  For starters, we decided to get a large antipasto to share.  This dish is attractively presented and consisted of black and green olives, salami, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, shrimp, roasted red peppers and wedges of cheese.  We liked most of it, except the cheese.  Most antipastos have mozzarella in them but here the cheese was, apparently, romano which didn't go well with the other items.  In fact, most of us didn't like the cheese with the exception being one of the grandsons.  In fact, when his brothers discovered that he liked the cheese, they gave him their portions LOL!One of the specials of the day was filet mignon served with mashed potatoes with gorgonzola cheese.  Our son-in-law wanted this until our daughter guilted him out of it by telling him that we were in an Italian restaurant that was well-known and he should get Italian food.  So, like me, he ordered chicken parmigiana with angel hair pasta.  I had heard that Leo's red sauce was on the sweet side but that wasn't the case.  It had good flavor and wasn't at all sweet.  The portion was huge---2 chicken cutlets (one would have been fine!)  You are given a choice of sides and I chose angel hair pasta, as did my son-in-law.  I think that the pasta was from a box as it didn't have that homemade flavor.  The cutlets were breaded and thin plus the amount of mozzarella on them was generous.  We both enjoyed our meals.They don't have a kids menu here so I told our daughter to ask if they would do a half-portion.  It turned out that they indeed do offer that option.  So the 3 kids got cheese stuffed tortellini with red sauce.  All of them just about inhaled their food---they liked it that much!Our daughter got the eggplant parmigiana with a side of pasta (I forget which kind).  She raved about her eggplant saying that it was the best she ever had.  In fact, she told me that she can't wait to go back for more!  I tasted some and I agree that it was well prepared and flavorful.My husband got sweet Italian sausage with penne and red sauce.  The sausage was nicely flavored with fennel.  He enjoyed every bite!For drinks, my husband and our daughter each had a Peroni beer.  I had wanted some ginger ale but they were all out.  So my son-in-law and I had Pepsi.  Our server brought us a pitcher to share.  The kids had water.We all left feeling quite full!  The kitchen was on the slow side but I think it had to do with their being busy.  We didn't mind as we were in no rush plus the wait wasn't so long that we felt annoyed.  Prices are very reasonable as all our entrees cost less than $20 each.  The large antipasto was $9.50.If you are in Hoboken, I recommend a visit here, if for no other reason than the history.  There are lots of Sinatra photos on the walls and the jukebox is filled with Sinatra music.  It's an easy walk from the train station---find your way to 2nd Street and it's right on the corner of 2nd and Grand.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

There was barely any sauce on both of our pastas - we ordered Penne Vodka and Fettuccine Alfredo.

It took 30+ minutes for the salad and almost an hour for the entrees.  Oh and the order was wrong. Waiter did not acknowledge long wait or poor service.  Had to hound the bus boy for service.It's a bit disappointing as this place should be a good casual Italian restaurant but needless to say I feel it's gotten enough of an opportunity to impress and has consistently fallen flat. This last time is the nail in the coffin.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

When you walk in there is a bar and a few high top tables, then a good amount of tables in the back. There are pictures of Frank Sinatra everywhere (he used to eat there).  I've tried a bunch of different dishes, bar pies, salads, pasta and chicken. Everything is great but my favorite is the bolognese!!! It's to die for. The bar pies are great too, so many topping choices and very inexpensive.

37,tRQa5TTIqjCzR7rNppRLMw,Susan H.,4.0 star rating,"When I first heard of Leo's Grandevous, I was intrigued once I learned of its history.  Opened in 1939 by Leo and Tessie DiTerlizzi, it was a favorite of Frank Sinatra's.  Whenever he was in the area, he would always pay a visit, usually after hours as he enjoyed not only the food but the company of Leo and Tessie.  Here is an article that talks about all this:  nj.com/sinatra/ledger/in…We were visiting our daughter and her family for Mother's Day and decided that we would try to have dinner here.  They don't take reservations but we took our chances and showed up around 5:30 p.m.  The place was busy but they were able to put together some tables so that there was room for the 7 of us.Looking around at the customers, it was clear to see that most were older folks which I suspect were part of the BNR (born and raised) Hobokenites.  It also appeared that much of the staff was also.We found service to be friendly and efficient.  For starters, we decided to get a large antipasto to share.  This dish is attractively presented and consisted of black and green olives, salami, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, shrimp, roasted red peppers and wedges of cheese.  We liked most of it, except the cheese.  Most antipastos have mozzarella in them but here the cheese was, apparently, romano which didn't go well with the other items.  In fact, most of us didn't like the cheese with the exception being one of the grandsons.  In fact, when his brothers discovered that he liked the cheese, they gave him their portions LOL!One of the specials of the day was filet mignon served with mashed potatoes with gorgonzola cheese.  Our son-in-law wanted this until our daughter guilted him out of it by telling him that we were in an Italian restaurant that was well-known and he should get Italian food.  So, like me, he ordered chicken parmigiana with angel hair pasta.  I had heard that Leo's red sauce was on the sweet side but that wasn't the case.  It had good flavor and wasn't at all sweet.  The portion was huge---2 chicken cutlets (one would have been fine!)  You are given a choice of sides and I chose angel hair pasta, as did my son-in-law.  I think that the pasta was from a box as it didn't have that homemade flavor.  The cutlets were breaded and thin plus the amount of mozzarella on them was generous.  We both enjoyed our meals.They don't have a kids menu here so I told our daughter to ask if they would do a half-portion.  It turned out that they indeed do offer that option.  So the 3 kids got cheese stuffed tortellini with red sauce.  All of them just about inhaled their food---they liked it that much!Our daughter got the eggplant parmigiana with a side of pasta (I forget which kind).  She raved about her eggplant saying that it was the best she ever had.  In fact, she told me that she can't wait to go back for more!  I tasted some and I agree that it was well prepared and flavorful.My husband got sweet Italian sausage with penne and red sauce.  The sausage was nicely flavored with fennel.  He enjoyed every bite!For drinks, my husband and our daughter each had a Peroni beer.  I had wanted some ginger ale but they were all out.  So my son-in-law and I had Pepsi.  Our server brought us a pitcher to share.  The kids had water.We all left feeling quite full!  The kitchen was on the slow side but I think it had to do with their being busy.  We didn't mind as we were in no rush plus the wait wasn't so long that we felt annoyed.  Prices are very reasonable as all our entrees cost less than $20 each.  The large antipasto was $9.50.If you are in Hoboken, I recommend a visit here, if for no other reason than the history.  There are lots of Sinatra photos on the walls and the jukebox is filled with Sinatra music.  It's an easy walk from the train station---find your way to 2nd Street and it's right on the corner of 2nd and Grand.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

There are tables in the front, aka the best seats in the house, and a bunch more in the back. The bar, though, is the nicest part as it is big and very inviting. Every wall is also a shire to both Jersey, Hoboken, and Sinatra - should come as no surprise to anyone. It is also a bit off the beaten path, being deep western Hoboken.Bathroom: It's a bit small and cozy but it gets the job done. It isn't filthy but I also wouldn't eat off the floor.Staff: The bartender was fast and pretty friendly, although he seemed to want to keep it strictly business. Our waitress, however, was awesome.  We were a group of 7 guys and she was quick with the uptake on jokes and wasn't afraid to banter back and forth with us.Food/Drink: They have a full bar and cold beer, no complaints. The food is hit or miss, however. I have been here in the past and had a pretty good meal but this time was certainly different.  We started off with some mussels (I didn't have any, but the others raved about them) and a few bar pies (really, really good!) and moved to the main courses: I had the Chicken Francese (sub-par at best) and the others had an assortment of things (which they all claimed were good). I guess I just ordered the wrong thing and I wouldn't hold it against anyone but myself.Value: The prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes, food quality and location.While I did not particularly enjoy what I ordered I definitely had a great time. It could have been the company I was with but, remove my meal, everything was good.

80,9bSaxQTQyP8XkAWVflR_UA,Steve V.,1.0 star rating,I have fond memories of my first and subsequent visits to Leo's. The food was nothing short of a portal back to my childhood in Brooklyn eating good old fashioned Italian staples bathed in a great red gravy. More recently though my visit was a major disapointment. The bufala mozzarella and tomato lacked the basic oil and vinegar you would expect and was room temperature.That was followed up by mussels in red sauce. For reasons I can't understand they are cooked and served on a half shell. This of course leads to the dry rubbery items I found before me.Having ordered the veal parm I expected good things to come despite the two previous courses. Instead I received some water logged pasta and veal so thickly coated in egg that it tasted more like an omelette than anything else.Once upon a time Leo's was a great place for Italian comfort foods. Nowadays it seems they rely on the fact that Sinatra once ate there and have little concern for what they put on a patrons plate.,Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
81,gZqRcjM3TxhsJF1PGRojCg,David T.,1.0 star rating,"I don't get why anyone calls this ""the best"" or even ""good"".1) It's dirty. Very dirty. The entryway is dirty and this should've been my tipoff (dust and dirt all over the walls). The table itself had crusty food still on it (how hard is it to wipe down a glass topped table?)2) ""Leo's Famous Mussels"". Leo is rolling over in his grave. So is Sinatra. These were clearly frozen mussels in a watery garlic sauce. No flavor, gross texture. Why use frozen mussels? 2.5) ""Warm prosciutto and mozzarella"". $11. Less than 1oz of either prosciutto or mozzarella over a majorly overdressed salad. Their cost? $.253) Veal Parm. Not bad. Might've been pre-frozen (kind of tough), but when you bury it in a salty enough tomato sauce it's hard to tell where any flavor is coming from. The only bright spot was the broccoli rabe and spinach, both of which were a $3 up-charge on an already overpriced dish.Total bill was $84 after tip (the service was good), which is insane given no alcohol.

It's a shame, because we were both in the mood for Italian, and I have been wanting to give this place a try ever since I heard Sinatra was a frequent visitor, but it's clear this place is riding on it's name only. I rarely write restaurant reviews, but this place definitely needs a wake-up call. About the food: For appetizers, we had the warm prosciutto and fresh mozzarella and Leo's ""Famous"" Mussels (in garlic and wine sauce). The first was two slices of meat and two tiny pieces of mutz over a generic salad. It tasted ok, but the portion was a joke for $11. I mean, are you kidding me for that price? I'm still shaking my head. It was all salad, barely any prosciutto or mutz. The mussels were on the half shell (very odd choice) over a very watery, bland sauce. The real kicker is the mussels were clearly pre-frozen or cooked earlier and reheated (my money is pre-frozen). I know mussels very well and cook them regularly at home. These were fishy tasting, and had an almost pasty texture... no resemblance to fresh mussels. Honestly, they were some of the worst I've ever had, and my partner agreed. We ate a few and stopped, and I'm now hoping they're not going to make me sick. For entrees, we both had veal parmesan, and while it wasn't nearly as bad as the appetizers, it was very mediocre and unseasoned. All I tasted was the tomato sauce that the veal was drowning in. Not worth the money. We both wanted to get a veggie of some sort instead of pasta as a side dish, and that was a $3.00 upcharge - each. We got broccoli rabe and spinach. Honestly, those two simple, sauteed greens with garlic dishes were the best thing we ate during the whole meal.Other negatives: When we sat down our table was dirty, and the floor was very dirty. Positives: The restaurant has some great old school charm, and I am a sucker for that kind of vibe. I love restaurants that have been around doing the same thing forever. Also, the service was quite good-- the young waitress we had did a nice job and we didn't wait long for anything. To sum up, I'd never go back. There are too many other (better) choices in this town. For $85 for two people, without any alcohol or dessert, we expected much more... or at least an average meal. You get (very weak) pizza-joint level food at Italian bistro prices. My advice to whoever manages this place: Get a new chef who can do justice to classic Italian food, clean the place up a bit, get some real napkins and silverware, and you'd have a real gem on your hands. As it stands right now, it's a pretty bad dining experience.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Another mistake. First of all, they make it with canned, chopped clams. They added three clams in shells to the top (along with their broken shell bits in my pasta, seriously?!).

I went there last night (09/27) with my boyfriend for dinner, and although the service was a bit spotty in the beginning, it improved as the meal progressed. I ordered the baked ziti with ricotta and mozzarella, and my bf ordered the veal Parmesan. We both had a glass of wine with our meals--Chianti for me, Chardonnay for him. I really enjoyed the consistency of the pasta with the baked/melted cheese, but my boyfriend wasn't thrilled with his veal, claiming it had a ""overly-fried"" texture. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful (when my bf tried to pay with his Citi card, she subtly whispered to him that Leo's is cash-only, rather than loudly announce it to the whole restaurant, which I thought was rather considerate). The only issues I had with the overall service were that we had to ask for water twice, and one busboy kept passing our table without bothering to refill our water glasses. The place got a bit noisy towards the end of our meal, but that's to be expected from a local Italian eatery. We'll be back.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

123,jc7QgNudj3OfRo3JRYTOpg,Empress T.,5.0 star rating,"Jeeezus H. Christ of Latter Day Saints, this food is good!!Best Italian food I've EVER had in my entire life. Went on a Saturday night around 10:00pm. Had the usual headache of finding parking in Hoboken, but once that was settled my fiancee and I trekked down to 2nd St & Grand. The restaurant itself is a pretty comfortable mom & pop style place. The place is an ode to all things Frank Sinatra. Hundreds of photos and portraits of Sinatra line the walls all around the restaurant and they play a never-ending stream of his hits playing through the speakers. It's actually quite pleasurable.We bypassed the bar  and went towards the dining area. We did not see anyone at the door so quickly realized we could sit where ever we wanted (after confirmation from one of the passing servers). The place was about half filled since it was later in the evening (they closed at 11 on Sat.) so it was easy to find a table and it wasn't too loud. Our server was nice and down to earth and checked on us frequently enough so that we didn't feel ignored and was careful not to be annoying and hover. Him and the rest of the servers are super helpful and seem to care that their guests get everything they want.The menu is pretty extensive, offering loads of traditional italian dishes. We ordered the Warm Prosciutto & Mozzarella & Mussels in Garlic sauce for apps. For entree we got Three-Meat Lasagna (beef, pork, veal, i believe) off of the special menu and the Veal Saltimbocca off the regular menu. We also combined it with a bottle of pinot grigio (Leo's is not BYOB since they have a full bar). Warm Proscuitto & Mozz Salad: HOLY SMOKES--orgasmic salad. I wish I was exaggerating so it wouldnt come off as me just being cray cray but im so serious. The proscuitto is a great salty season to it and has a lovely soft texture thanks to the mozz. Combined with the crunchiness of the (also seasoned) salad and it was absolutely perfectMussels in Garlic Sauce - I'm not a fan of clams or mussels so I didnt eat it but my fiancee did. He said while they were good, they werent amazing. He ordered a small tray but it was still a HUGE portion so he didnt finish it.Three Meat Lasanga - This was another hit, beautifully executed and a perfectly balanced taste. Their tomato sauce is so boss and went well with everything. Perhaps one of the best lasagnas I've ever encountered, hands down.  It came with a choice of two additional meats on the side--I chose a meatball and sausage but didn't finish because of the next dish....Veal Saltimbocca - If the menu is the Greek pantheon, then this is probably Zeus. The veal is so friggen tender! And the saltimbocca...What the heck is in the sauce!?!? My fiancee ended up taking pieces of bread that they brought out to our table earlier and sopped up every last inch of the liquid off his plate. I joined in (lol). It also came with a side of spaghetti (also good).To say we were happy campers by the end of the meal is a vast understatement. We were pleased, surprised at the huge flavors, and thankful. Funny because a woman at a neighboring table quipped to her date ""i wish i could live here..."" At the end we got a slice of red velvet to go (which was decent, but i dont care for red velvet anyway).Our entire meal rounded out to around $85--VALID! For the amount of food and sheer awesomeness (including a whole bottle of wine) that is relatively cheap! the most expensive entree on the online menu is $19.95 so its definitely affordable. I almost forgot to mention that each course was timed perfectly, our entrees coming out in about 20 minutes.In one visit Leo's has stolen my heart and I intend on bringing my whole family here. Definitely want to try the pizzas too since I've seen rave reviews about it. If you're an Italian fan, do yourself a favor and go to Leo's!!TIP: this place does NOT accept credit cards of any kind so make sure to bring cash or be prepared to use the ATM.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

So I HAD to investigate as I have yet to find an amazing Italian place in Hoboken. This place is not on the beaten path; it is tucked away, far from Washington street where it's ALL about location and less about taste and service. The waitresses, two lovely ladies who happen to be sisters, are super friendly and endearing. They bend over backwards to make sure you are taken care of and get your order exactly how  you want it. The place is clean and is clearly a tribute to Frank Sinatra (who was born in the same hood and used to frequent this place ages ago).The food is SUPER yummy. Authentic Italian all the way AND moderately priced. They have a cool looking bar where locals sit and chat to the bar tender in a separate room. You can tell this place is for the locals, by the locals. I heard the owner died a few years ago but the staff still speak kindly of him and want to uphold his high standards.

Being at Leo's is like being at home surrounded by family enjoying great food. It's a very intimate place. you WILL rub elbows with people and wait in line for the bathroom, but the food makes it all worth while! The only thing that never liked was the parking and the fact that they don't take cards. For the parking, it's hoboken. what can you do? get there early or go to a parking garage.

Pancetta instead of bacon, yes it should be a nice dish.   I got a child's portion of pasta swimming in cream sauce.  The amount of sauce (heavy cream and butter) could have been good for 5 lbs of pasta.   The gf went for linguine with canned white clam sauce.  They actually threw  in 6 real clams to top the dish off.  I guess even they have limits on the minimum acceptance of the slop they serve.Leo's is def in my top 3 most disappointing meals of 2012.Leo's Grandevous - OUT!  do yourself a favor and Rendezvous elsewhere.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I Yelped the place before coming and thought it sounded pretty good. However when I got there I was a little disappointed. I order the garlic wine mussels and the hot antipasta and although I consumed the whole thing, it wasn't amazing. I thought the muscles were a little dingy, and the wine garlic sauce could have been done better. It should have been served in a deeper dish so that the mussels can simmer in it's flavor. The hot antipasta was good, ha mussels, bakes clams (that was a bit too baked), shells, mussels, and shrimps (they were pretty good). My boyfriend got the spinach ravioli and told me that it tasted like it looks--drenched in Alfredo sauce. My aunt got the chicken Marsala. They did an I interesting spin on it and made it sweet.

Actually I personally thought the mussels marinara sucked (an italian staple) but the entrees were OK.I don't know why, but way too often, people in Hoboken over-exaggerate how good a restuarant is, especially on Yelp.

Leo's food has always been good, solid, dependable, affordable and satisfying, but nothing to write home about from a culinary standpoint. But it was a completely authentic, old school Hoboken experience, from its fantastic jukebox to the cheesy decor (Sinatra memorabilia notwithstanding) and the cranky staff. A number of years ago, however, they tried to make the joint a bit more upscale, did some renovations, removed some of the Sinatra artwork and just made it less... fun. (At least the jukebox is the same and I actually like that they only take cash.) Leo's is still one of the best places to go for a gut-busting Italian meal in the home of Sinatra (although the wine list is meh at best... that's the one thing I wish they WOULD'VE upscaled), but, like so many things in this gentrified mile square, Leo's just ain't what it used to be.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We dropped $5 in the Juke Box and listened to Sinatra and Count Basie live at the Sands. I perused the pictures on the wall and sipped my cocktail. The place was a great place to rest on a cold January day after hours of walking Manhattan and Hoboken.Sergio was very kind. We had asked for another place to eat since the dining room was closed for another hour. He said this was the best place in town. And I must admit, he was right. We stayed in New York for a week and this was the best meal I had the entire 8 days. This is the place served up the best Lasagna I had ever had in my life. The meatballs were to die for and the sausage...oh the sausage was delish! So glad we stayed for dinner. Everything is right about the place. The history, the vibe the location.

Total miscue on all aspects.     The entrees were a little better, but I expected more from them. This is not an expensive place but it wasnt cheap either. The food was what you would expect in a two bit pizzeria that also cooked regular food. Sauces sucked and the portions were not that wow, and who wants more of lousy food anyway.     Out of habit I ended up leaving a 20% tip, though half that was deserved.

Worse Italian food I have ever had ..I am not going to waste my time telling you all about what I had and how horrible it all was.. Just want to let owner know you need a new chef.

Contrary to what is listed on the top of the yelp page, they do not take reservations. We had a party of 10 and were able to sit right down though. It is a quick walk from the train station and even faster from the light rail. There are a couple reviews talkign about the waitresses. We had a waiter who was very sharp and personable. The food was all served hot and tasted fresh. No complaints from anyone who went. You can get beer by the pitcher which is a good value, and the food is generally a good value. The portions are not gigantic, but what you do get is very tasty. I would recomend this place to friends and would be interested in going again.For some reason it reminds of a place in little falls called ernestos that I used to go to with my grandparents.

The service is about as terrible as you can get, I've eaten here several times and each time we waited about 20 minutes to put in our order. I don't need to be pampered and made feel special when I eat, I just want someone to realize that I've been sitting around with my mouth watering for quite some time.There are some other nuances that kind of annoy me about this place. The menu is very limited and doesn't have some staples that you'd expect to find at an Italian restaurant, calamari is one example that I can think of off the top of my head. They also don't accept credit cards which annoys me. It's 2012, I don't find it cute and retro to be a cash only establishment, I find it unnecessarily frustrating. And if you're going to make it cash only, at least have an ATM in the place, but they don't even do that, and by Hoboken's standards, there's nothing with ATM near by.Overall the food is pretty good (although definitely not the best Italian in Hoboken) but be prepared for an exhausting dining experience.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

My only suggestion for food (because honestly, everything is really great) is to definitely try the mussels. If you like food on the spicier side, get them Fra Diavolo. The sweet sauce is good also, but fra diavolo is the way to go. The mussels are always cleaned to perfection (I've never had any grit at Leo's) and cooked perfectly. Price-wise, its not too bad. With mussels and an entree expect around 20-25 a person. Definitely WELL worth it. It's no wonder the chairman of the board used to hang there, this is classic, great, Italian food.

256,SREGUwOUVTIuMGqiGkv3vw,Carol A.,1.0 star rating,"After reading all of the reviews about Leo's, my boyfriend and I were extremely excited to try it out. Upon entering the restaurant we were suprised by the informal decor and atmosphere. There were many children sitting in the surrounding tables and it was very loud. Our server was an older lady who was sweet as can be and very attentive. I ordered the chicken marsala and my boyfriend ordered the pasta with vodka sauce. While we were waiting for our food the waitress brought a basket of bread over. Some of the bread was OK and other pieces were burnt and tasteless. We ordered diet cokes which were the most flat soda I have ever tasted before.Our main entrees were also a huge disappointment. My chicken marsala tasted so strong of alcohol that i could barely eat it. The cook must not have cooked off the alcohol from the marsala wine which left the chicken tasting like it was sitting in straight alcohol. Finally i gave up on trying to stomach my chicken and pushed it aside. Along with my meal I received a bowl of ""angel hair"" pasta that looked like it was just taken out of a store bought bag. The sauce was overly sweet and unimpressive. My boyfriend's penne with vodka tasted nothing like vodka sauce. The waitress asked if I didn't like my chicken and I told her it was very bad. She took the entree off of our bill which was very nice and we appreciated it.This restaurant was a huge let down, as we were excited to have a great italian place right around the corner. They did attempt to correct the horrible meal by not charging us for the chicken marsala but it does not change the fact that it was bad food .Do not listen to the hype about this place, we did and we will never be returning!",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I did not like the ambience of eating in the bar room due to the close proximity to the bar, tv noise, etc. The food and service were good - but it didn't make me want to travel ALL THE WAY across Hoboken when there are great Italian alternatives closer to me.ALL THE WAY meaning like 5 blocks off Washington.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
258,OKacUGfVB9Ac5LZJLvshWQ,Michele B.,4.0 star rating,"Where to begin?I read the reviews on yelp before I went to this place, and I think some people here have some screwed up ideas. 1. I went on a hot day, around 5pm. I felt sticky after walking from the PATH. It was so nice to walk in and sit at a pleasant bar with a wonderful bartender!2. I'm glad I knew it was cash only.  I've been to plenty of cash only places in NYC- yes, they exist, and they aren't rare. 3. I had a gin and tonic. they had a decent selection of gins, although there was nothing fancy. The bar was formica- it was like being in the 60s. Cool. And yes, there is Sinatra memorabilia everywhere- Frankie used to eat here and he was a Hoboken native. If you go to Italy and have dinner at a place where Giuseppe Verdi hung out in 1901, you'll see tons of opera stuff from him everywhere, too.  Sinatra was one of the best jazz musicians of all time- listen to his albums from when he was with Capitol.4. I told the bartender that when I was a kid in Queens my parents used to take me to a small neighborhood red sauce place, and I was in the mood for old-school. The guy actually put on the jukebox and played oldies like Louis Armstrong, Jerry Vale, Elvis, and Luis Prima, as well as The Chairman of the Board. That's hospitality.5. My bread came to me warm and crunchy, with soft butter. Perfect. And my drink wasn't watery. Nice.6. One guy at the bar ordered pizza. People, this is not a pizzeria- this is an italian restaurant. The pizzas are bar pizzas, i.e., for one person. It looked delicious and slightly floppy, the way NYC/NJ pizza tends to be. Yum. In this area, if oil isn't dripping off the pizza, something is wrong with it. 7. I ordered shrimp Fra Diavolo. It was on a Tuesday after Memorial Day.  The shrimp were fresh and slightly briny, with good texture. The sauce was spicy but not to the point where there was only heat and no flavor. The spaghetti under the sauce was al dente. Great.8. When my order came, the bartender looked at it and asked me if it had too much sauce. He said they could re-plate it with less sauce if I wanted.  I declined.  That was good service too.9. I ordered a cannoli for dessert. The shell was crisp and the filling was fresh and homemade.  The espresso was tasty. I ordered it with a piece of lemon peel on the side, Sicilian peasant style. 10. One drink, one entree, one espresso (comped), one dessert- $29 and change, including tax. The bartender was personable, friendly, and gave me great service. And as an African-American woman dining alone in a mostly Italian-American neighborhood, that's a big deal. I'm also a personal chef who went to culinary school and who has eaten in numerous fine restaurants, and I was impressed.I will be going back with my boyfriend so we can listen to Dino, have pasta 1920s style, and maybe finish with some limoncello. One thing. This place will let you order takeout, but don't expect a takeout waiting area.  This is a real restaurant, not Applebee's.EDIT- Four stars here means 'This food is pretty good, the ambiance is fun, and I intend to go there again'. It does not mean 'the food and ambiance here is one step below Le Bernardin'. In other words, it's a good solid place and a special neighborhood gem. If you are in Hoboken it might be worth stopping in because there's a high probability of having a good relaxed time.  Danny Meyer, the patron saint of NYC hospitality, would be happy with the service I received.",Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
259,mNp9Zw0x1c12-JHnqeIFIA,Benjamin R.,5.0 star rating,My friends and I stopped here for dinner with no idea of what to expect --- the outside is unassuming and there aren't any windows to peer into.  What we found is a shrine to Frank Sinatra that happens to serve Italian food.  The staff is friendly to the point that you could bring a date and even if it was your first visit you could give her the impression you are somehow connected to the mob.,Leo’s Grandevous,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
