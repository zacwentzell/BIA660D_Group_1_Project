There's bar seating, which I'd recommend trying. Other than that, small tables throughout the restaurant. There's cute outdoor seating which I didn't really get to see set up, since we went on a chilly winter's day. The veggie burger is great. I love finding places that can do a good job at making veggie patties and this place is definitely a great way to go. You can add avocado to your burger which I also recommend. Great list of wines by the glass (reds, whites, sparkling). Service super friendly, casual. If you're coming with a group, wouldn't recommend more than 6. It's small. Gets busy during lunch on a weekday also. Avocado toast looked delicious.

19,6jVsa3hkvbECGcKw1tA19A,Laura P.,4.0 star rating,"Perfect place for a casual lunch/brunch. There's ample seating, especially when you combine the outdoor seating in the front, the inside of the restaurant, and the patio in the back. The space is generous, comfortable, and very open. I love back patio in particular and highly recommend sitting there when the weather is warm. There are plenty of umbrellas to keep you shaded, but if you want to be in direct sunlight, you can just move the table/chairs accordingly. It's a really serene place overall and the service is just as calm in the best possible way. The servers are attentive, but super chill. They are really flexible and even keel. It's like they hire people based on that vibe, which is nice. We didn't come across or see anything frantic, loud, or rushed. It's a calming place.Many of the pastries and breads are made in-house, including the english muffin they use for some of their breakfast sandwiches. The croissant and multi-grain toast is from Bien Cuit. I didn't try the toast, but it honestly looks spectacular. Our server asked if we wanted a side and we declined, but in hindsight, we should've obliged. We tried the grapefruit brulee, which is served with mint. The caramelization on top was very light and not very noticeable, so it would've been nice to amplify the effect to bring out the sweetness. You're served a half large grapefruit with a grapefruit knife and spoon. Grapefruit is so high maintenance, it takes forever to eat it, but it's such a classic brunch option that isn't on enough menus these days!We also ordered the fried egg & cheese sandwich and the red quinoa bowl. The fried egg & cheese comes with your choice of tomato & avocado or bacon and is served on the aforementioned house made english muffin. You can get the egg done however you'd like if you don't want it fried. The sandwich is pretty standard and nothing special, but a solid choice. The english muffin is the star - it's quite delicious.The red quinoa comes with tatsoi, cucumber, poached egg, manchego, and almonds. It's served with a pear vinaigrette, but we opted to get yogurt instead. The yogurt they have is one of the best I've ever tried. It is so rich, so creamy, not incredibly tangy, but with a touch of sourness. I asked what it was and our server immediately went to ask the kitchen. She came back with a picture on her phone of the container. It is a lebanese kefir lubne. SO good. The manchego cheese was a nice touch to the dish. By the way, their ketchup (which I use on eggs) is also particularly delicious. In general I'm a fan of just the classic ketchup - you know, heinz and what not. Fancy ketchups tend to be just terrible in comparison. I don't know what this ketchup was and neither did our server, but it was really good. Not very sweet or acidic, but super smooth.Overall, the food is good, but not spectacular. But I really like the vibe of the place. That combined with solid food and good service, make it a place worth trying.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

There's ample seating, especially when you combine the outdoor seating in the front, the inside of the restaurant, and the patio in the back. The space is generous, comfortable, and very open. I love back patio in particular and highly recommend sitting there when the weather is warm. There are plenty of umbrellas to keep you shaded, but if you want to be in direct sunlight, you can just move the table/chairs accordingly. It's a really serene place overall and the service is just as calm in the best possible way. The servers are attentive, but super chill. They are really flexible and even keel. It's like they hire people based on that vibe, which is nice. We didn't come across or see anything frantic, loud, or rushed. It's a calming place.Many of the pastries and breads are made in-house, including the english muffin they use for some of their breakfast sandwiches. The croissant and multi-grain toast is from Bien Cuit. I didn't try the toast, but it honestly looks spectacular. Our server asked if we wanted a side and we declined, but in hindsight, we should've obliged. We tried the grapefruit brulee, which is served with mint. The caramelization on top was very light and not very noticeable, so it would've been nice to amplify the effect to bring out the sweetness. You're served a half large grapefruit with a grapefruit knife and spoon. Grapefruit is so high maintenance, it takes forever to eat it, but it's such a classic brunch option that isn't on enough menus these days!We also ordered the fried egg & cheese sandwich and the red quinoa bowl. The fried egg & cheese comes with your choice of tomato & avocado or bacon and is served on the aforementioned house made english muffin. You can get the egg done however you'd like if you don't want it fried. The sandwich is pretty standard and nothing special, but a solid choice. The english muffin is the star - it's quite delicious.The red quinoa comes with tatsoi, cucumber, poached egg, manchego, and almonds. It's served with a pear vinaigrette, but we opted to get yogurt instead. The yogurt they have is one of the best I've ever tried. It is so rich, so creamy, not incredibly tangy, but with a touch of sourness. I asked what it was and our server immediately went to ask the kitchen. She came back with a picture on her phone of the container. It is a lebanese kefir lubne. SO good. The manchego cheese was a nice touch to the dish. By the way, their ketchup (which I use on eggs) is also particularly delicious. In general I'm a fan of just the classic ketchup - you know, heinz and what not. Fancy ketchups tend to be just terrible in comparison. I don't know what this ketchup was and neither did our server, but it was really good. Not very sweet or acidic, but super smooth.Overall, the food is good, but not spectacular. But I really like the vibe of the place. That combined with solid food and good service, make it a place worth trying.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"
40,uRbVhZeqHZ8iRsiBi0qf7A,Cat S.,4.0 star rating,"Beautiful, romantic restaurant that's great for date nights - whether that's date with a significant other or just an intimate catch-up with a good friend. It's not as flashy or well-known as some of the other West Village hot spots, and the location itself is a bit hidden, which is part of the reason I love it. It doesn't feel as stuffy or trendy as many other places of this caliber. The menu changes seasonally and you really can't go wrong with the dishes here. They always do a fantastic cheese plate, good salads, REALLY good vegetable side dishes, and very good gnocchi and risotto. I know I'm a vegetarian, but from sharing dinner with meat eaters here, it seems to me that the vegetable dishes can be even more impressive than the carnivorous ones. They have a good list of wines by the glass as well as good cocktails.Great place to take someone if you want to impress them!",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Chocolate chip cookie is also great but I think I had the best French fries I ever had in my life right here.  Wish I was in the area more often to be able to come here.,Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"
43,uvI5nOW0fTcV4AV02Q8-wQ,Eric J.,4.0 star rating,"Always a solid weekend brunch option. I first came here when the line at Jane was a little too unbearable. However, after eating here a couple times, the brunch is by no means an inferior product. The crowds are much more manageable, in my opinion, which is one of the best things about Hudson Clearwater, along with the general quality of the food. The place has a pretty rustic look, with a full bar, and multiple levels of seating. The once unassuming entrance has now been replaced by a front door that is much more conspicuous, facing Hudson Street.I most recently got the grass-fed burger, with jalapeno cheddar. Cooked to a nice medium rare,  the burger was the right amount of juicy and rich. The fries are hand-cut, crispy and come with a nice jalapeno aioli (jalapeno everything), as well as the standard ketchup. The short rib hash, with two fried eggs on top, is also excellent, although not quite as well-portioned as I'd personally like. Such is the life of a fatass. Additionally, none of the dishes are terribly innovative, but the food and preparation has never let me down in terms of quality, and that's what keeps me coming back.It's a little on the pricier side for brunch, as a lot of the dishes trend towards $20 straight up, but the quality has always been pretty good, so it ain't too bad. Service is generally pretty attentive throughout the meal. An oddity was that one of the waiters was trying to pour our waters from very high up above the glass to perhaps impress us with his pouring skills. It would have been very impressive, had he not splashed everywhere on the table. The thing is, even after splashing everywhere the first time, he came back and did it again, splashing even more the second time. Just do a normal pour, buddy.In all, an incredibly reliable place for some really good food. Will definitely be back for a hearty, no-nonsense brunch, or perhaps dinner one of these days. One of my friends swears by the duck dinner dish, so I'll have to come back and give that a try.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

It was pretty crowded when we arrived around 11:30 AM on sunday, but there was no wait time at all. The had a good selection of creative brunch cocktails. I started with the Elderflower Spritz, which was nice and refreshing. My friend got the El Diablo, which was fantastic and the tequila aftertaste was nicely masked by the blackberries. We decided to share two entrees and went with the duck hash and the salmon eggs benedict. The duck hash was fantastic! They combined shreds of duck meat with potatoes and fried them together, which turned out to have a nice toast to it. The spinach that came with both dishes were a nice touch as well and was seasoned well. The only thing I didn't like was that the dishes were kind of chilled. I think that's what they were trying to go for but it would have tasted better if they eggs were warm. Pretty fast service though they neglected to refill our glasses of water. They were prompt about refilling our cocktails though. Brunch was delicious and a pretty spot to enjoy it!",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

It was one of the first nice days we had in New York this year so we decided to sit outside. The garden is very cute. It is closed off and surrounded by a bunch of flowers and herbs. We ordered two drinks to start. The volver ($14) which is tequila based with mezcal, green chartreuse, lime, ginger, agave, basil, and grapefruit bitters. It was good but I liked the duchess ($14) better which had gin, plum, early grey tea, blackberries, lemon, and agave. Luckily my boyfriend liked the tequila one better so we switched. To start we shared the burrata $16 which was so good. You really can't go wrong with cheese. We also got the roasted golden beets which were good but I wouldn't order it again. For the main courses they had two fish entrees and we got both. Mine was a red snapper $29 with green peas, fiddlehead ferns, and morels. It was super delicious but a little on the well done side. Next time I would specify on how I want it. I really enjoyed the other fish as well I just can't remember what it is. Regardless, the fish options change but I would highly recommend them as both were great. Our waitress was also helpful when we ordered wine and the service was great. The atmosphere is cute, intimate, and laid back but also nice enough where you could dress up a little more. I would highly recommend it here.

My friend and I both went with the Calacas because I LOVE anything with jalapeno-infused tequila, but there were a lot of drinks on the menu I'm excited to try. The Calacas was great, but it has beet juice in it which kind of takes over the flavor of the drink.As for food, we just split a cheese plate but everything was delicious and nicely presented.

After coming here, I feel like this is one of those restaurants that's suitable for a variety of occasions, whether it's a girls' night out (which I came here for), date night, birthday dinner, drinks...you get the idea.My friends and I came here on a Tuesday evening with a reservation. Restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, but it filled up throughout the night. We split the burrata and savory bread pudding for the table - the burrata was your standard delicious ball of cheese, but bread pudding was a hit with everyone. It's not on the menu anymore, but do get it if it ever returns. I chose the Long Island duck breast for my main course, which was seared to a perfect medium. For desserts, we split the chocolate pot and the pear cake which were both sweet notes to end the mealSince I always arrive absurdly early to anything, I also had the chance to grab some cocktails at the bar. The name of my drink escapes me now, but it was well-balanced and strong.I wouldn't say this meal is the best I ever had, but everything was solid, the service was friendly, and the ambience is quintessential West Village charm.

I got the jalapeño-coriander roasted short ribs which rests on a bed of fingerling potatoes and roasted jalapeño (not spicy at this point). The meat was tender and well seasoned while the portion size was enough without sides. Dessert was the warm chocolate pot with honeycomb and peanut butter gelato. Quite rich but not too sweet. The chocolate was gooey/fudgey and the honeycomb provided a sweet crunch. The gelato was nothing special but delicious combined with the rest. Value: the short ribs were $28 and the chocolate pot was $10. It's about average for West Village but it was truly delicious. Service: we went on a busy weeknight, so service was a bit slow but the environment was so nice so it wasn't a huge deal. Ambiance: if it's a nice day, try to get a table outside. They have a nice backyard patio with string lights which gives it a cozy feel. Otherwise, the back of the restaurant has large open windows that still offer the same vibe.

Next, we had the pork chop and the risotto-- both extremely good although I would say the Pork-chop was good but I've had more memorable dishes. The risotto  was incredible.  We also had sides of brussels sprouts and the carrot dish which were outstanding -- who knew a side dish could really still the show? As for drinks, we had the Hudson mule which was out of this world good, if you like ginger of course. With dinner we got the house wine and the label had a picture of the back door which we thought was very genuine and cute. The wine was very good-- I recommend. Overall we had a great experience at this restaurant I would return. Great for a date!The Damage: unclear since I didn't pay.

First impression was that it was very crowded inside, but we had reservations so we didn't have to wait to be seated. Overall ambiance of the restaurant is cozy, dimly lit, very romantic setting, but the downside was the noise level. I wasn't seated so far from my husband but I felt like I had to shout to talk to him. Our sever was very sweet, and informative of the menu. Someone was always ready to refill our water glass or clear the table of empty dishes. We ordered the smoked mozzarella and the scallop ceviche as appetizers and needless to say they were both excellent choices; perfect blend of flavors. As entrees we had the hanger steak and the cheese ravioli. His steak was delicious and perfectly medium, as asked. I enjoyed the potato rosti the most, it reminded me of hash browns. I will say that the cheese ravioli was just Okay. The flavors didn't really do it for me. If we go back I won't be giving that a second try.

105,p5B0nTAu7AO2T2GtwS64lQ,Albert C.,4.0 star rating,"As you may know now, I am a huge fan of hidden restaurants. Hudson Clearwater, during the summertime at least, is characterized by an unmarked facade and a green door hidden in a red brick wall. People go through the secret door and are welcomed by a well lit terrace and steps leading into the restaurant. Due to the weather, the terrace is actually closed and I entered through the Hudson Street entrance. This brought me to the lower level of the restaurant that held the bar. There are stairs on the right side of the room that leads to the upper deck with the exposed kitchen. Every time I have gone to Hudson Clearwater for dinner, I have requested to sit around the kitchen. Watching the chefs is mesmerizing and a great conversation starter. Today, I sat by the window overlooking the terrace. Since I am a huge fan of the hangar steak, I gravitated towards the hangar steak ragu topped with parmesan. My friend ordered the 8oz angus burger. My dish was delectable and my only complaint is that the portion was too small! The ragu was cooked to perfection - not too soft and soggy but not too hard either. The hangar steak was braised and despite being cooked, still extremely tender. The cheese was sprinkled over the dish but did not overpower it. The sauce brought the dish together. The burger looked solid and it was accompanied by fries. The fries were served with ketchup and mayonnaise aioli. I felt the ketchup tasted better than the aioli, which seemed a little tasteless but super oily. Finally, I really enjoyed getting to know the bartender Boz. He made us a few off the menu cocktails based merely on our tastes and nailed it.

Our party of six was seated at a back table on the second floor, which was nice because we were out of the way. The restaurant is quite small and tables are packed close together, so I was glad not to be in the thick of things! The bar upstairs is very cool and it's fun to watch the chefs preparing the food. I think the reason the food is so good is that the chefs really preserve the integrity of the ingredients. The fish is not masked by a million other ingredients. The duck is cooked so that it tastes like seared duck, not like hoisin or ginger or whatever else. The flavors of each thing are enhanced, but not smothered. Deep red sweet potatoes arrive tender from the oven upon a bed of ricotta. Carrots are broiled to crispy perfection and merely accented by harissa. Dessert was forgettable - I'd recommend getting more appetizers/sides and skipping dessert.Service is warm and welcoming. Bathroom is TINY.

Pretty unprofessional.Given our entrees were brought out wrong and late and they priced the drink wrong I assumed they would have at least comped the coffee (which was not good) but we got nothing comped. Instead the table right next to us got a dessert comped because their food come out late (in fact they got their check right after we got ours).Food was four stars. It is unfortunate.

We split the ceviche appetizer, which was on the small side and really heavy on the onion, and we each got our own entrees and split a side of vegetables.  I ordered the duck breast, which was phenomenal, and my friend ordered a Halibut special, also very nicely prepared. The ratatouille side dish was large enough to share and very flavorful. The service was good but not great. It took an extremely long time (over 30 minutes) for our appetizer to arrive, at which point we'd both finished our glass of wine. As a former server, I see this as a tactic to make people have to order another glass or bottle. Our entrees took an additional 30+ minutes, which definitely isn't the servers fault, but an explanation would have helped. The best part of the dining experience at Hudson Clearwater was the outdoor garden seating area. It felt like an ethereal secret garden hidden in the West Village.All in all an ok dining experience.

125,ghzPmvAEm21QwCTs5R6Mtw,Ryna D.,4.0 star rating,"Hudson Clearwater's address on 447 Hudson Street will land you in front of a locked door. There is no signage to indicate whether the restaurant even exists. Another speakeasy gimmick? Not quite. Yes, this discrete West Village restaurant wanted to take the 'hidden gem' badge seriously when it opened in January 2011 but unlike the speakeasies of 2008 there is no secret invitation needed, no secret phone numbers you have to call, and no pretentiousness such that we've come to expect from hard to access hot spots. In fact, when you call for a reservation they are almost too friendly on the phone. And when you do wander into the back garden and make your way into the charming bi-level restaurant the staff are more than welcoming. The space itself is cozy and charming with beautiful woodwork and a gorgeous marble bar. It's a great spot for a discreet meeting over cocktails or a romantic dinner with your significant other. And since the spring of this year it's also now a wonderful spot for a low key brunch in the village. Start off with coffee and the house muffins. Or if you prefer a boozy brunch then the cocktail menu won't disappoint. The Damson Spritz feels like a classic brunch cocktail, the Calacas a delicious substitute to your tired Bloody Mary with its unique beet juice and tequila base, and the Duchess' Tall a nice tea-based cocktail that pairs well with the food. And speaking of the food the Jalapeño sliders are unbelievably moist and highly recommended. The steak and eggs is another hearty option while the Brioche French toast is another favorite.The service is warm and unpretentious and the atmosphere is decidedly low-key. And in a city where brunch has become the cool thing to do and hot spots result in hour-long wait times Hudson Clearwater is a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend it for the next time you're out for brunch with your girlfriends, or when you've got friends in town, or even when you just want a nice brunch out with your sweetheart. Grab one of the tables on the lower mezzanine, enjoy your meal leisurely, sip on a couple of cocktails, and say hi to Chef Wes Long in the open kitchen.

I just happened to choose this restaurant for dinner from reading some articles online, and it turned out to be the perfect spot. The ambiance was warm and cozy, with a lot of energy. We loved sitting at the bar and being right there next to the open kitchen.The food was simply amazing. And for a great cocktail, the HC Pimms is a refreshing, tasty option as well! The portion sizes were great, and it ended up being an incredible value, especially considering how the NY dining scene can get rather pricy. Everything we had that night was amazing, starting from the imaginative amuse bouche of shaved asparagus, ricotta, honey, and lemon. I highly recommend the buttered Long Island clam appetizer (w/gnocchi, sauteed kale, lemon bouillon, crostini) -- the broth was phenomenal, so flavorful and sweet from the clams and not overly salty. The grilled pork chop (w/wheatberry, haricots verts, pork lardon, frisee, buttermilk ranch) was incredibly tender and falling-off-the-bone soft, and better than I could have ever thought pork chop could be. I loved the extra texture of wheatberry as the grain. The duck breast & confit leg (w/fava beans, English peas, chanterelle mushrooms, grape tomato, pattypan squash duck jus) was equally impressive. Perfectly cooked duck breast, flavorful confit, and really lovely jus. The chanterelle mushrooms were decadent, and the tomato gave a great burst of freshness.I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in New York!",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

The waitress was very attentive. I got the Burger and added the fries for an extra $5. It was a sad portion of fries for $5. Hardly a hand full. After a few bites, I noticed a hair in my fries. The waitress took it away and they said they would not charge me for it and make me a new one. The Manager came out to apologize.  They offered me a drink while I waited for my new burger to come out. The drink came and had one sip. Unfortunately, there happened to be a hair in my new drink also. I walked over to the waitress and the look on her face was priceless. Needless to say, the manager came out again and was clearly embarrassed  and confirmed this is not the norm.

134,e3QkfdpttBYP0DLehxYPQw,Ingrid S.,4.0 star rating,"If you're in the mood for some fabulous food with fabulous conversation followed by a fabulous foot massage and ending with a night of ""fabulosity"", Hudson Clearwater is a good start. I don't make a habit of going to fancy restaurants. But when my fancy friends want to have fancy dinner parties on their birthdays, I'm always game once in a blue moon. The entrance is even hidden in the back. Don't try to get in the front way. You will look like a fool. There's a little garden and footpath entrance winding up to a tiny space with warm glowing lights and a kind of chic modern yet rustic feel lay-out. Overall I would say presentation is 5 stars and beyond. Food is worthy of 4.5-5 stars but the value of your meal is where I can't justify 5 stars. My friend's boyfriend is in the restaurant business and understands wine prices more exceptionally than most people. He said that the entire list was way over-priced for its value. One of our $30-40 bottles was worth about $9! Okay, I've gotten that frustration out of my pants. Moving onward.They first presented us with a lovely amuse bouche/palate cleanser of fresh ricotta, cucumber, jelly, and mint. Refreshing and perfect to start a meal. I decided to try and be as frugal as possible, which isn't saying much and chose to stick to beer instead of joining in on the bottles of wine. Though, I sampled the wine and what I think was the Gamay, Jean Paul Brun, ""L'Ancien"", Beaujolais, France 2012, and it was both peppery and delicious. Hinting at a sweetness of dark cherries. For my first beer I had the Augustiner-Brau Edelstoff, tasting light and of bananas. An excellent decision and a solid and impeccable beer. My second was the Russian Imperial Stout which I've sampled before and it's very similar to Mother's Milk or Keegan's Milk Stout. My dining partners split two appetizers: The burrata salad with marinated artichokes, tomato, arugula, celery leaf, blood orange, vincotto (which is pretty much a boiled down grape juice/wine sauce). ($14) - This seemed beautiful. I didn't taste it but not worth the price for a small salad for dinner. I love fresh hunks of mozz though and it was of impeccable quality.Second appetizer: Gnocchi with buttered clams and sautéed kale in a parsley-lemon bouillon, accompanied with crostini. ($12) This one I tried. At least 2-3 times. The broth is heavenly with the crispy chunks of crostini to sop it all up. We asked for more crostini it was that good and they were more than happy to oblige us. For my entrée I ordered the crispy duck breast. ($25) You have to go with the duck. It's their thing. I haven't had such an opulent piece of fatty expensive meat in such a long time. It's accompanied by adirondack blue potatoes, sautéed spinach, carrots, and tomato peppercorn jus. To be honest, the portion size of the meat is perfect. Everything accompanying it on the plate is very very tiny. They aren't sides of anything and kind of just presented for you to get a full taste of the duck and have a visual aid of a complete dish. The potatoes are more of a potato puree and very delicious but not very substantial. The sauce was the best part of anything. There was a hint of almost a lemony hollandaise and a bit of pickled vegetables under my bed of duck breast which I was not expecting. But I enjoyed it. My other friends went with the Grilled Hanger Steak ($26) and the fish of the day which was Fluke. I tried the steak, which was cooked medium rare, Stephy-kins and I share a kindred love for bleeding meat. It was cooked perfectly and very well seasoned. Everyone else at the table ordered the duck like myself and seemed to enjoy their dishes. Again, my complaint is that we were still hungry afterward. Which explains why I ate like 500 Hershey kisses later. . . . BUT we also ordered desert. Because who does birthdays without cake?! Not us! For our deserts we ordered both the chocolate-banana brioche bread pudding with strawberries and dark chocolate drizzle. ($9) And then the Dark Chocolate Pot De Crème with raspberry, white chocolate whip cream, and a sugar wafer cookie. ($9) If I had to pick between the two, go with the Pot De Crème. Both were pretty orgasmic in their own rights. I don't think the sole man at the table really got it when we were in ecstasy clawing at the chocolate with our spoons. But hey. The Bread pudding has chunks of chocolate in it with drizzle all over. The strawberries are also chocolate covered. Really quite fantastic. The pot de crème is like a combination of a decadent chocolate lava cake with a thick billowy custard. Nothing like flan or crème brulee nonsense. It's so RICH. Just get this and lick the spoon until you go into a sugar coma. In finality, would I come back? Probably not unless someone paid for me. I can't justify spending $50-75 on a dinner with those portions and knowing I can buy their wines from a vendor for 1/4th of what Hudson Clearwater charges.

Our waitress was super nice, professional and spot-on with recommendations.I started with a lovely salad composed of sunchoke, turnip, blood orange, shaved brussels sprouts, shallot, mustard vinaigrette. It looked like a still life, was lightly dressed and incredibly fresh -- delicious. For my main, I had the seared duck breast with smoked hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, farro, spinach, preserved lemon gremolata. This was SUPERB: rosy and tender without that chewiness you often get, beautifully seared, and very well complemented by the other ingredients -- especially the smoky, meaty, umami-rich mushrooms. For dessert, we split the vanilla bean cheesecake with huckleberry compote, poppy seeds and crème fraîche. This was also very good (but I thought might benefit from a spark of lemon to brighten it).Good wine list and cocktail selection, too.There are a lot of farm-to-table, market-driven menus around town these days, but this place does it right: the flavors sing, the ingredients are fresh and high-quality, and the preparation shows real thought and care.

There were many empty tables (that didn't look like they were being reserved for big groups)! Don't know who they were holding them for.  I guess if we ever come back again, we'll call ahead and book a table.... Moving on, I ordered the catch of the day, which is a tuna that the server promised to be cooked medium-rare. Wrong. Tuna came out medium-well. I will eat a medium-well steak, but a tuna stead cooked medium-well is a bad steak.  I didn't finish it. Folks at my table ordered 1 hanger steak medium-rare and another hanger steak medium. When the steaks were brought out, they were switched.  So they were each more than a few bites into their steaks before realizing they needed to swap their dishes.  Otherwise the food is really good.  The appetizer portions are tiny though, so it's kinda overpriced.  I would've expected much more from a restaurant of this caliber.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

With a grenache and a sancerre in our hands, we breathed in the aroma of the dining room and everywhere we looked were happy faces. This was a happy place, good looking too. We started with the shaved brussel sprouts that were delightfully rustic with a touch of sweetness (thanks to salted caramel), then each went for the duck breast with broccoli rabe, carrots and cabbage. I couldn't even finish the modest portion bc it was so incredibly flavorful and amazing that my appetite was sated halfway through the meal. It pained me to not continue through that crispy skin and perfectly moist fowl bosom! Good thing my partner had made her way through hers and continued onto mine - what are friends for?

The second time I went I was bar crawling with a friend late on a cold Friday night and popped in, which was silly. Despite this being a ""hidden"" restaurant just about everyone knows about it.Crowds and poor hosting skills aside, the food here is faboosh and the drinks are tasty (though I don't know if they'll just whip you up a cocktail the same way a place like Dutch Kills would) and the bartenders are incredibly sympathetic and charming.On my most recent visit my friend and I shared an app, salad and entree. While I personally was still a bit peckish and not just a wee bit drunk, I probably could have done with more food. Obviously, don't share your plates. The serving sizes are perfect for a single person, who may be kind and allow their dinner guest a taste.The last time I went we all had apps, entrees and dessert and were thoroughly satisfied.Really, the food here is expertly crafted, and it's all seasonal so the menu changes to ensure that everything is fresh. Most recently I had the butternut squash, brussels sprouts, with sour cherries app, that was so divine I was waxing poetic on the many delights of pairing sour food with something savory. I would have licked the plate if no one was watching.We also ordered the duck which was listed as ""crispy"" though I found it not to be as crispy as I was hoping. It was however, delicious and juicy so I can't complain that much.Because our host kept telling us it was ""only 15 minutes"" til we got a table, which happened no fewer than 3 times, the bartender gave us a complimentary cheese plate which was truly delicious.

Cute garden space, brick walls strewn with weathered shutters plus ivy. Outdoor umbrellas keep it cool on a sunny day.Tasty and interesting vittles. Duck hash with poached egg, tatos and spinach was just the right portion, plus the unexpected zip of mustard seeds solidified this dish's place on my ""things I don't make at home"" list. Generous with coffee and water refills, and thoughtful with attending to the patio umbrellas. Only note: be ready to relax, as service skewed to the calm and collected side. This worked for us, as it meant more chatting and lounging over brunch.Would love to come back to dine at upper bar, which overlooks the open kitchen.

Overall -- was not blown away and thus a little disappointed.  Probably because I had built it up in my head for the special occasion..First off, as some other yelpers have mentioned, the side secret doorway no longer exists due to a recent community board ordinance....not a huge deal.  Second, we we're seated at a table for two, right up next to a table of four.  So cozy to say the least, but expected for the west village. For drinks, we each ordered a hudson mule after reading the reviews, and they came our right away...like RIGHT away...and the ice cubes were already a little melted which made me think they were pre-made behind the bar because its such a popular thing to order. OK, fine.  We then had a bottle of wine with dinner, the malbec that is listed on the dinner menu, which was very good.The food...for appetizers we ordered the lamb ribs and a cheese plate with jam and honey.  The ribs were very good and the greek yogurt/tzaziki sauce that they were served with was great. Cheese plate -- read below under 'service'.  For entrees, I ordered the duck based on the rave reviews, and the BF ordered the filet.  The duck was a bit too fatty for my liking and not at all 'crispy' -- I've had better elsewhere.  My boyfriends filet however, was very tasty and a very nice sized portion!!  I stole more than a fair share from his plate.  Service...was just ok. Felt a bit rushed and we had to send the server away twice before our taking our order so we could get through the menu at least once.  When they took away our lamb app and started setting up the table with the dinner knives, I knew they had forgotten about our cheese plate, so reminded our server and he darted away and came back immediately with a nice sized cheese plate served with fresh bread. Ok, great, except obviously they had already fired up our entrees, so those came out 2 seconds after getting our cheese plate.  We left them sitting on the table while we ate some cheese, so I ended up asking if they could reheat the duck, which to their credit, they did (and may have even brought out an entire new dish..).The ambiance was very nice and romantic, and sure, great little date spot in the west village.  But after the experience, it wouldn't be a place that i make a reservation 3 weeks in advance.   :(",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

I ordered the lamb chop special.  I don't use this word lightly, but it was gross.  It literally was a one inch piece of meat attached to fat, and lots of it.  The rice it was served with tasted good, and the snap peas were a treat, but the lamb fat chop was such a horrific disappointment--quite literally the worst piece of meat I have ever seen in a restaurant.  It is scary that a chef at a place of this supposed quality would plate a piece of meat like this.  And so that I'm clear, I'm greek, so I know my lamb.Really a 2.5 for the wine and first course, and the place had a good vibe, but that lamb was truly disgusting.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

The steak was truly sad, as it came out with three thumb nail size slices of steak. I've had foie gras come bigger than the size of ""steak"" portioned here. And my sandwich was also severely lacking. It came on a side plate with no greens or fries or anything. It was just a piece of spongy bread with a fried egg and bacon and avocado (which I paid extra for) on it. Very unimpressive for $12.Sad to say that I wont be back any time soon for brunch.

After walking by the restaurant nearly twice, we did find the ""secret door"" my friend was so craving for and found ourselves inside. We were greeted immediately. We had a party of three and the place was jam packed with people! The hostess suggested we sit at the kitchen bar, which we did. The atmosphere was beautiful, despite being crowded. An open kitchen with the cooks using so much detail I couldn't wait to try it!The menu looks amazing! My mouth was watering from reading all the descriptions. The service was super slow, and I'm pretty sure half way through our meal we ended up with a different server, but they wereFriendly. The menu was extremely over priced for the portion sizes. I had the lamb shank for $17 dollars which was roughly the size of an ice cream scoop. Despite the size, it was amazingly flavorful, along with my friends ice cream scooped sized quinoa. Other then those two items, everything else was severely disappointing. My $11 dollar burratta salad lacked any kind of flavor or pizzaz and my friend complained of the hanger steak being extremely salty. Our dessert was average. On a positive note they do have a wonderful, decently priced wine list!Out the door after drinks, food, taxes, and tip we spent about $110dollars per person and left still hungry!  And I never got that wow! factor, like 'wow!

It was enough food without the soup.

The sauce on the pork chop was great, and the sides complimented it well. The corn side dish was full of flavor, the lamb ribs were done well, the risotto was a perfect al dente, and the lemon bar was a great finish. I also really enjoyed my Dutchess cocktail.

We didn't have a reservation, but they were able to sit us comfortably at the bar by the window right away. It was a perfect seat because we got to watch the staff setting up the food behind the bar. We started with the cheese platter and spinach salad - both delish! The cheese platter included midnight moon, a fresh ricotta, and a blue, with fresh berries, honey, and some incredibly tasty preserve that had a hint of clove which was a nice surprise.  The spinach salad was super tasty, my only wish would have been that the brie be  left out at room temp before being plated. It wasn't gooey yet because they have it prepped in peaces and stored in the fridge.For dinner we shared the mushroom asparagus grain feature, and three veggie sides - all of which were tasty and delicious!

Took away the small app plates and changed the forks and knives off the table for entrees. The pan seared cod is like a masterpiece! So pretty and did not want to mess it up. It was a little bit overcooked in my opinion but the flavor of the herbs, peas and jus was good.

However, for a busy Saturday night this is a pretty minor grumble! The wine list was small but a good selection and reasonably priced too. The food was excellent, lamb ribs and a celeriac noodle special appetisers were both delicious and a nice size to share, get a flavour but not spoil an appetite. Like many other people here, I didn't get past the duck entree of the menu and wasn't disappointed!

Weird but interesting.Anyway, the stars of the evening were the food, the service, and the chefs. We sat at the chef's counter (which I recommend if you're into food) and there was really only one miss the entire evening: the lentil salad. Tasted very healthy but not inspired. The crispy duck breast and hanger steak were impressive though and cooked to perfection and the desserts (a gooey brownie and lemon bars) were YUM.To top it all off, the service is really quite friendly, competent, and conscientious - they comped our dessert since the wait for a table was longer than anticipated.

We asked our waitress if a more chilled bottle was available, which she proceeded to tell us everything was all the same - with a distinct attitude and without offering an alternative. We then asked if it's possible to swap for another drink (I mean who the hell wants to drink room temp prosecco?) In which, she literally rolled her eyes, and reluctantly agreed. We placed our orders then and didn't even think again about the service until we realized she was no where to be found halfway through our meal. She attended numerous tables AROUND us but never made an appearance at our table again - someone else delivered our food, we flagged down another server for a dessert menu, another to order more drinks.

For entree my date got the duck and I had the steak - both were phenomenal. Like OMG delicious. The service was great. Although we did have 3 different servers... so that was a little odd haha, but it worked out well because no matter what, someone was there to assist with getting the check, taking our order, clearing our table - the whole shebang. The only thing I would have liked differently is our seating arrangement - although it was a good little area, it was also right next to the server station which was loud and REALLY busy, but after looking around, I don't think there were many options for 2 seaters so I guess I can't complain too much. All in all I had an amazing experience and an amazing time and I know my date did too. I would give it 4.7 stars if I could.

On a summer evening all of the entree dishes sounded a little too heavy so we opted for a mix of salads (arugula and watermelon, kale) and apps (chilled corn soup, scallop and tuna ceviche, burratta with brocollini). My favorite was the ceviche. The burratta was a bit too garlic-y so would avoid next time.Our server was sweet if not a bit impatient, but overall very attentive. Discovered the private dining room and the backyard on the way to the bathroom and would have much preferred to sit out there on such a lovely night. If I was to go again I think I'd wait until winter when the heartier entrees would feel more appealing.One last thing, a little more light to see what you're eating would be nice.

208,wKRrmMLuegp-bwimooOrug,Wes F.,5.0 star rating,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Hudson Clearwater.  It embodies everything a high-end West Village restaurant should.  It's cozy, slightly hidden, has an attentive staff, and offers up some of the best food and drinks I've had in recent memory.The thing that struck me most was the unconventional menu--especially the appetizers and sides.  The majority of them are comprised of unconventional combinations of fresh produce that come together in incredible ways.  The quinoa and kale salad (by all definitions a bowl of ""chick food"" in my mind) was delicious.  The butternut squash dumpling was outstanding.  I've never had something so simple with butternut squash stand out so much.  The buttered clams with gnocchi was probably the weakest of the three, but still very well executed.  Definitely not to be shared, as it's more of a soup that the description leads on.But what I'm most excited to talk about is the Crispy Duck Breast.  Let me start off by saying that this is an exquisite dish.  Actually, no, it's better than that.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's one of the best things I've EVER put in my mouth (and there have been some pretty great things in there).  The preparation was superlative.  It came cut off the bone, a perfectly prepared, juicy medium rare with a crispy skin exploding with flavor.  It also sits on a bed of vegetables with a hint of honey dijon creme fraiche that sent it over the top.  I won't try to explain what it tasted like.  But it was the best duck I've ever had. The deserts were also fantastic.  Their chocolate bread pudding was moist and warm, and the apple tarte was a perfect balance of warm caramelized apples and pastry juxtaposed with cold vanilla ice cream.Also, you can't go wrong with there wine or whisk(e)y list.  They have unique wines from unexpected regions and some rarer varietals from the usual suspect, Northern California (e.g. Gargulio).  Also, if you drink bourbon you should know, they have the 15yr Pappy Van Winkle right on the menu for $50 if you're looking to celebrate.All in all, we had a great time and ended up staying for hours longer than we planned.  I'll definitely go back and will cherish it as one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

There is no obvious entrance  -- I am sure I am not the first to have this issue. When I got inside, I went to the manager and told him I was outside for a long time in the freezing cold trying to find how to get inside. Rather than apologize and show some understanding, he said they have never had a problem with people finding their way in the 3.5 years they have been open.  He said everyone else in this crowded restaurant found the entrance. ""So I must be an idiot,"" I asked him. He stated there was no way to make the entrance any clearer.  I suggested an arrow, a sign, a mention on the website or in the email I had exchanged with the restaurant beforehand. Or maybe take off the sign on the main door that says pull!  Still, he made no apology!Look, I get the whole mystique of a place with a hidden entrance. I have gone in through a coffee shop to the speakeasy Bathtub Gin, or through a phone booth for Please Dont Tell.  But both of those are at the address it says it is at, they just dont have a sign out front.

The butter clams came in a soup that is what you'd imagine New England clam chowder to taste like if the clams had the spotlight, and not heavy cream. Squash confit plus squash dumplings was more complex-tasting than you might think. For entrees, the duck breast was sitting on a bed of addictive sauce, while the Atlantic bass worked really well with its accompaniments. The chocolate brioche banana-bread pudding is definitely worth a try - a bit lighter than you might think, and definitely good for sharing among 2 or 3.In terms of drinks, definitely try the Creole and the Volver if you like old fashioneds, or the Sparrow if you like creamier and sweeter drinks.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Sigh.My guy and I went with another couple. We weren't too crazy about any of the appetizers so we started with a couple of sides and just the gnocchi starter. The portions were very small for the cost and while I'm in full support of portion control, when I order appetizers I expect to be able to share them comfortably. The food was tasty though so on we go.Two in our party ordered the filet mignon and I did not. Big mistake. I ordered the pork chop which comes with fingerling potatoes (approx. 2 or 3...it's sad). When my meat arrived I was immediately struck by the super pink color. Disturbed at the thought of being presented with underdone pork I flagged our waitress who explained that the meat is brined so it comes out pink....OK. I understand the theory of brining. I know it can potentially inject a lot of flavor. However, this chop had been brined to death. It was SO SALTY. I could barely eat a quarter of it. The texture--due to the brining--was wholly unpleasant bordering on rubbery. Sigh.I had one bite of my guy's filet and just wanted to kick something because it was so damn good and I was stuck with something akin to a dog's chew toy.All told, with drinks and dessert all around, the meal cost over $80 a person with tip. WAY too expensive for what we got.

The reviews boasted it's food and atmosphere.  The food was the biggest disappointment.  We had the duck raviolis on the recommendation of the waitress, but they were under cooked and kind of flavorless.  I had the special, which was tuna- it came out a little fishy and nothing to write home about. Besides the food however the atmosphere was comfortable.  And the service staff was above average.  The waitress we had was very pleasant and besides her recommendations on food, she did a good job- she knew the wine selection fairly well and was just the right amount of attentive.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Service was 4 stars throughout the night, although we had reserved the private room and received attention from waiters when needed. The experience though should have been much better. We had a reservation at 9 and did not get seated until after 10. I understand that's the practice of some New York restaurants, but I had booked a month out for my girlfriend's birthday dinner and we did not want to start eating at 10:30. I would have expected management to at least apologize for the inconvenience. There was no apology and we were actually treated fairly rudely and forced to wait outside.

227,XtQpjBsFcFp3fIiSf69NzA,Laura H.,5.0 star rating,"This place was recently added to my list only because I'd heard rave reviews.  Honestly, from the pictures I'd seen I wasn't THAT impressed but my friend wanted to meet there for drinks so I showed up.  The bar is tricky to find which I guess adds appeal.  It's on the corner of Hudson and Morton if you go by the address but it's a fake entrance.  Instead you need to walk along the north side of Morton to a little green garden door that leads into a patio and then into the restaurant.  Okay I started to be intrigued by the adorable patio and was fairly impressed by the comfy yet romantic interior.I sat at the bar where the handsome bartender made me a deliciously refreshing, Upstate Rose, made with Applejack, Rye, Apple Cider, Lime, House-made and Pomegranate Grenadine.  After that I tried the Hudson Mule which was equally as good but tarter and lighter (bison-grass vodka, ginger beer, lime, and candied ginger).The cocktails made me fairly hungry so I was forced to order the pan roasted quail with fennel, fernet cherries and pickled mustard seeds which is one of the best meals I have ever had.  Small but flavorful.  Those cherries were BOMB.""Dinner"" ended with the honeycrisp apple tarte tatin with sea salt caramel and chantilly cream which was good but a little bland even if it did smell amazing coming out of the kitchen.I think my review says it all when upon leaving I told the bartender I'd be booking my birthday dinner here.Coincidentally I went back for my birthday and it was JUST as good.  I had the herb-roasted beets, crème fraîche, toasted pumpkin seeds, and micro basil to start and the grilled hanger steak with thyme, potato-cauliflower gratin, kale and chimichurri.  Both were very good although the quail still reins supreme.I'll be back.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Not sure, but it was excellent.  Date had the Sea Bass, and while I didn't try the fish itself, it came with a carrot-saffron puree that I was sneaking bites of, and awesome sunchokes - I don't usually even like sunchokes - they have some form of trickery around here to make everything taste fantastic.We sat outside, but I'm going to go back to sit by the bar next time I need to impress someone.  5 stars.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Clearwater makes you feel like you're in a modern rustic cabin with their sexy dim lighting, clean-lined furniture and exposed-beam ceiling.I went there on a double date during memorial day friday and thought it was a great place. Never heard of it until I got there, but i wish i've heard of it earlier. Its best to make a reservation in advance as the place is small and usually gets booked up. We were hoping to sit outdoors as that area is first come, first serve but it was rainy and cold! But if we could go there again, would love to sit in their outdoor patio.They have some amazing custom drinks which are very enjoyable (& even some cutie bartenders too!)We ended up being seated at the chef's table, an area which sits about 7-10 people in front of the kitchen (kitchen is open and you can see everything they cook) which I actually enjoyed since you get to see them make the meals for the whole restaurant. It was nice seeing the chefs at work which is something you don't see quite often at a restaurant. Only bad side to sitting here is that you are RIGHT next to the door and if its cold (in this case it was) every time someone comes in and out the wind just kills you every time. Another weird thing is that to go to the bathroom you have to leave the restaurant and go to another entrance to get to the basement... which i imagine would suck if it was snowy outside!At first they gave us a sampler dish, which is really good.. no idea what it was.. tasted like a vinaigrette onion thing with some lettuce.. but i wish they gave us more.We ordered the oysters and clam gnocchi soup and both were quite good. Gnoochi soup was amazing, very buttery, flavorful and a good amount of clams insight!We asked the server what dishes she recommends and she said we can't go wrong with anything on the menu since everything is pretty popular. We then ordered the chef's special steak and the crispy duck breast. Both were done very well. Steak was cooked to perfection and the duck breast was very juicy.We ended up getting the chocolate pot pie dessert which was very good.Overall great restaurant.

Had a party of 8 for dinner early on a Friday night at 7pm and we were met with lots of attitude from the staff as we waited for our party to arrive.I hope you like cozy and don't mind sharing your personal space, because you'll likely be sitting on top of someone else's table.  Service aside, wasn't wowed by any of the food.  Our group opted for a number of appetizers and I ended up trying two of them and can't recommend either. Marinated lamb ribs - the meat was incredibly tough for lamb and had such a smoky flavor that it was tough to get through even one. The grilled squid tasted as though it were several days old and had almost no seasoning or flavor to speak of.  For entree? There was a steak frites special that was probably their saving grace.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (which was surprising) but tasted great.Dessert - the chocolate banana bread pudding was decent, and the lemon bar wasn't overbearing. Food was okay, service wasn't great, but ambiance is kinda cool.  I think I would give it another shot for dinner, but looks like everyone loves this place for brunch.

We're vegetarians and so is my mother, and they added an additional meat-free dish to the menu for that night (barley risotto), which I really appreciated. The food here is always interesting and creative. We paid a set price per guest, and they allowed us to bring in our own wine (which my in-laws had made as a wedding gift to us).We also called that day to ask if we could arrive an hour early, because our courthouse marriage went more quickly than expected. The restaurant had no problem with this, which helped us avoid having to kill time with so many family members on a drizzly day.It's also a beautiful interior. We were in the main dining room on street level. Just a really nice, fancy-yet-homey vibe here.Kind of weird to go through this on your wedding day, but there was actually a problem with the bill. I can't even really complain about that, though, because the server resolved it quickly.My one issue was with not with dinner but with booking our reservation. You can't reserve more than three months in advance, and since I was planning a wedding event it was a little nerve-racking to have to count down the days. You kind of want to know where your wedding dinner will be sooner than three months before. Also, it was difficult to reach anyone to discuss details or ask questions; any email I sent resulted in an automatic reply. Even after I managed to get a person on the phone or on email, the answers were evasive and inflexible. HOWEVER, once I was able to speak to the event manager, everything was smooth sailing, and he was very accommodating.Over all, love Hudson Clearwater ...

It used to be a light, flavorful dish that is now pretty flavorless and doused with butter. Please fix the dish! Less butter, more lemon juice. You can't even taste the clams anymore. Also, the gnocchi was undercooked and the whole dish was much better enjoyed in a bowl vs. the plate you guys use now. Besides that, the salads here are so fresh and light. I could order a bunch of salads and enjoy this as a meal. I find the mains and sides to be too butter heavy. This isn't surprising as we sat at the chef's counter and watched them douse everything in butter with a very heavy hand. A side dish does not need half a stick of butter. I enjoy butter as much as the next person but not when I feel like I only ate butter for dinner. Aside from my butter rant, the food here is still very good.

Mains were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. The brussel sprouts come shredded and were the best I'd ever had!On to dessert- we ordered the bourbon ice cream - good but I've had much better; and the chocolate espresso pot de creme - it was very grainy, not a REAL pot de creme, so be sure to skip it.Overall, I really wanted to LOVE HC but a couple missteps made the experience less than amazing.The wine list was great and really well priced, the service from Meghan was outstanding and our mains were truly delicious.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

First of all - why do they put caramel on everything? We all look forward to ordering brussels sprouts from restaurants this time of year..well folks do not order them here. They come doused in a barrage of CARAMEL. Caramel, and/or sugar in general, should never be mixed with a green vegetable like brussel sprouts. It tasted like a slimy, bad dessert when I was hoping for some kind of crisp and savory brussel delight. It was just WRONG.  The hanger steak was mediocre, again, nothing special. The quinoa salad was your average run-of-the-mill quinoa dish (AKA bland and boring) and left me with a stomach ache. Apple tart dessert was lame. It was just apples, basically no crust. This was supposed to be a tart, I didn't order apple sauce. The ambiance and the food are similar to that of every other quaint west village restaurant except here there is nothing spectacular to set it apart. It's just a wannabe Waverley Inn or Spotted Pig. Considering it's on the corner of a relatively busy intersection (Hudson + Morton) and it's floor-to-ceiling windows are covered with tacky white curtains, the discreet sign-less façade and unmarked entrance through a courtyard are laughable, really.

We had a reservation, and were seated on time at a romantic, great table for 2 at the back of the restaurant.  Love the warm vibe of the open kitchen and wood tables. Great lighting.   Looked at the menu, and was drawn immediately to several things on the menu.  Food:  I ordered a fig salad.  Waitress tells us after the fact, oh, sorry we are out of figs, we are substituting something else. I ordered duck.  Waitress returns to the table after we place the order and says halfhearted oh, sorry we just sold the last duck.  When your menu has about 5 entrees on it, wouldn't you make sure not to run out of your signature at prime time on a Friday!? The apps we got were fine, small portions not particularly interesting flavors.  The steak was excellent, but kitchen didn't honor medium rare request.  Fluke was fine. Service:  Waitress wasn't very attentive (see issues above) except to rush us to order or get more drinks. Slow to bring wine.  Not welcoming, basic too cool attitude. Evening then took a terrible turn when they squeezed a table for six in next to us - carrying a 2 top over my husbands head.  Their party included several drunk mid twenties girls who proceeded to yell/raise the decibel level in the restaurant by multiples.  It was so bad the date at the table on the other side of us chose to finish their bottle of wine at the bar rather than stay at the table.

Our server was mediocre but got the job done. Where the experience really went sour for me was with their head of house. He was uppity and pretentious and held the attitude that seating us was ruining his day, newsflash its your job. He was running around frantic the entire meal which made us feel uncomfortable. He then came to our table and said that he needed the table and we had to be out in 30 minutes. Our entrees hadn't even arrived yet and we wanted dessert and at least another cocktail... Needless to say this place would have much been more enjoyable without him, too bad that one person can ruin the experience.

It's quaint, has a cool vibe to it, the food is pretty good, and the cocktails are really good.Ambiance: Like so many other West Village restaurants: Joseph Leonard, Aria, or Commerce; Hudson Clearwater is very tiny and very cool. There just aren't that many tables for customers to dine in. But this is what gives it its charm. For months I walked up Hudson past Morton, or across Hudson on Morton, wondering what was behind that red door. I heard the merry chatter behind the concrete walls on Morton and just figured someone threw great get-togethers in their West Village backyard. Supposedly, the story goes that the owners didn't have enough money for a sign and when the first reviews came out highlighting how ""Hudson Clearwater is a hidden gem"" and ""it has an undisclosed entrance"" that only those in the ""know"" know about...well, not having a sign, stuck. There is a nice little courtyard that is great to dine in in the summer. Inside, the restaurant is split into two sections, the upper and the lower. Diners have the choice of a small table or to sit at the chef's bar and be part of the chef's madness.Food: A ""must"" order is the cider-brined pork chop served with polenta, market root vegetables, pork jus, and fried sage. It's seared to a temperature that appears to be medium rare, which biting in to a pink pork chop can be scary. However, it has been brined over night, ""cooking"" it throughout. It's nothing short of delicious. Another go-to item is the Mexican corn. One suggestion, HC served a sushi style raw fish crudo to start, which was a little out of character for this All American type place (I noticed it's no longer on the menu). It came sprawled on a large plain dish when it would have been nice had it been served neatly on a Japanese spoon. Service: It wasn't quite as jovial or ""on top of things"" as some of its neighborhood brethren but nevertheless it was still quite good. The staff is a good-looking crew and I'd bet most of them are models by day and servers by night. I'd like to see them spend a little more time on the patrons than on looking so damn good.Wine/Drinks: HC has a good selection of wine, not great but good. The cocktails are what sets HC apart from its competitors. I'd recommend trying the two tequila cocktails on the list: the Calacas and the Mayatl. The Calacas is made with Jalapeño Tequila, Beet, Lime, Agave, Chili-lime Salt and is my favorite. It's a hearty cocktail. A close second is the Mayatl made with Mezcal, Chartreuse, pastis, thyme, rosemary, lime. The Hudson Mule is also quite good. It's made with a bison-grass vodka, ginger beer, lime, candied ginger.Eat well my friends,JustaGuyThatLovesFood.tu…",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

I read about it a while back on one of the blogs I follow and decided to finally give it a try now that I'm living in New York. I was more than impressed. First things first, the location! Amazing. It's one of those hidden spots. You expect it to be on the main street, but you actually have to go around the side of the building, enter through an unmarked door, which takes you into a lovely garden patio where you enter the restaurant through the back. This is definitely part of the appeal.  It had an exclusive feel to it, like we were walking into someones home for a dinner party. The interior is warm and inviting and sparkling with candlelight. It was packed when we got there because the patio got rained out, so we had to wait a little while on our reservation. No matter, we decided to mosey on up to the bar for some cocktails. For me, the Lolita and for him the Hudson Mule. Both were incredible! We were started with a fall inspired amuse bouche and then dug right into our butter clams appetizer, which was light and comforting for the first day of Fall. For entrees we ordered the Crispy Duck Breast and the far from boring Pearl Barley Risotto. Both were delicious! Very simple dishes, with some nice complexity in the flavors. For dessert, the Honeycrisp Apple Tarte Tatin with sea salt caramel and chantilly cream. It was heaven, and really, so was the entire meal. From start to finish everything was perfect.

The fish was excellent - moist and tender with crispy skin - and blended very well with the accompaniments.

My food was less than memorable, and the service, albeit friendly, was atrocious. Of course we all want friendly and polite staff, however, I don't want them to be SO laid back and SO ""chill,"" that they forget they are doing a job. When my server messed up our order, he seemed so nonchalant about it, as if the establishment was forgiving ME for complaining.... Moreover, i ordered a Kettle Extra Dirty on the rocks, but they didn't have Kettle -- understandable, i guess. However, when I received my drink, I thought I was going to suffer from alcohol poisoning after the first sip. Now, I know some people complain about drinks not being ""stiff"" enough, but I am not one of those people. Bartenders are taught to count their pours (or eye-level them, whatever) for a reason. And these counts are to set up a proportion to make the drink taste less like I'm dying to get intoxicated, and more like I am trying to enjoy an alcoholic beverage -- make sense? I get that they are probably just used to the crowd requesting a heavy pour, however, that is not the right way to do things. And a heavy pour should only be used at the request of a customer who WANTS a stronger drink. A martini is a strong drink in and of itself, which i understand. But that is also why I ordered the drink to be extra dirty. It was all alcohol and no olive juice. Maybe I don't remember my meal bc it was just ok; maybe I don't remember it because I was too busy wondering where my waiter was half the time. Or maybe I don't remember it bc the smell of my martini (which I couldn't even finish) erased all of my memory from that evening. The other customers, however, did seem to be having a good time.

Just when I thought this spot couldn't get any better - they now serve BRUNCH! FFF and I came here for Easter Brunch and were seated right away, lovely surprise indeed. We toasted the holiday with the Damson Spritz - a bubbly cocktail with Prosecco, Damson plum, blackberries and a lemon twist. Oh my goodness was it ever delicious! The coffee is very good too and strong. I hate it when the coffee is weak sauce. We shared an array of things (that's usually how it goes down when FFF and I are together) starting with the Grapefruit Brulee, which was just divine. I've never had anything like it before and loved the combination of tangy grapefruit with caramelized sugar on top. We also had a fruit bowl which was mostly berries and even had pomegranates, not filled with melon. Then in addition to more cocktails and coffee we moved on to the French Toast and the French Omelet - both were absolutely delicious. The french toast comes with spiced pecans which are so tasty. The omelet is filled with mushrooms, cheddar and tomatoes and comes with arugula. Neither entree (or the starter plates for that matter) is too large and perfect for sharing and tasting.

We walked in on a Tuesday night around 7:00 with a reservation at the chef's counter. It was a nice night, if a bit chilly, and a few brave souls were enjoying cocktails out in the front garden. The atmosphere of this place is so freaking adorable. We were able to score a small table for two down by the bar so we grabbed it. We were kind of in the way of the servers trying to place drink orders but they were very gracious about it. I only have a few tiny little complaints. The wine by the glass offering could be a bit stronger and I wish they had better stemware. We had had some wine at Lela Bar across the street so we didn't want to do a bottle, although the bottle list is not bad. I started with the Valdo prosecco and it was very mediocre to below average. My date chose the Chateau Lagrezette Malbec but then changed it to the Johnson Family  Cabernet instead, I wasn't a huge fan of either. I realize the proper pour is 5 oz but when you have a  small glass and only pour up to a proper amount it doesn't equal 5 oz, just sayin. Our waiter was very attentive as were all the people working there. The amuse bouche was sublime, a slice of grapefruit with fennel and mint, I wish they had that as an appetizer! We decided to split a bunch of things so here's the rundown:1. warm red quinoa, black kale, swiss chard, almonds, confit pear, manchego - uhmmm a MUST order, I could be satisfied eating this every day.2. braised lamb shank, mint spätzle, carrot, broccoli, parmesan cream, tarragon - another winner, the use of mint in a lot of the dishes was so fresh and springlike I could almost taste summer on the way!3. DUCK BREAST & CONFIT LEG fava beans, english peas, chantarelle mushrooms, grape tomato, pattypan squash duck jus - the duck was absolutely perfect, crispy skin, moist meat with the leg being insanely tasty.4. green & white asparagus, smoked ricotta, pea tendrils, lemon vinaigrette - this wasn't my choice, I mean asparagus is asparagus but this was definitely one of the better sides I've had.The food is definitely 5 stars, the atmosphere 4 1/2 due to having to shout across the table and the few little pet peeves I mentioned were the only thing holding me back from awarding them the coveted 5 star rating.

It was busy and yet we never felt rushed.  We sat at the bar to watch the chefs prepare each dish right before our eyes as we lingered over generous glasses of Malbec and Pinot Noir, both exceptional. It was a kick to watch them put together beautiful plate after beautiful plate and it gave us a full multi-sensory experience of our meal.

The side entrance lends a speakeasy vibe and gives it some character without being too pretentious (the host greeted my boyfriend and me at the stairs to the entrance with a warm welcome and immediate seating. When I asked for a different table he was willing to accommodate). Rustic feeling: very dark, very romantic and very cozy. I went on a Monday night and it was pretty crowded. My table for two was by the bar (on the floor below the chef's table), so it felt crowded as the amount of people waiting and/or drinking at the bar overflowed to the dining area.Our server was nice enough, but after she took our order and served us our bottle of wine, she didn't come back to our table once. She didn't even come back to put our bottle over ice. When we tried to get her attention, but she was off in her own world. Eventually, we stopped trying and asked the busser for things when we needed them.The food was meh. The crab cakes appetizer was delicious, but my main entree was pretty disappointing. I got the sea bass. It was perfectly cooked, but under flavored. My boyfriend got the hanger steak which kicked the sea bass' ass. I should have gotten something else.Overall, it's just an okay restaurant. Maybe since I expected something mind blowing because of all the hype, I set my expectations too high. The bottom line is if I were to come here again, I would do it differently. 1) Don't sit in that server's section again. 2) If you're coming as two, the chef's table offers a more interesting seating arrangement and dining experience over a table in the dining area. 3) Don't order the sea bass. I'm not cheap when it comes to good dining, but for $23, it would have tasted better if I cooked it myself.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Well, let's see: the amuse-bouche was a slice of avocado trimmed with a little walnut, mint and sweet (honey?) syrup on top. The clam gnocci appetizer served with crostini was heavenly and served steaming hot. As for my entree: I became completely antisocial as I devoured the special that night with the undivided attention it deserved. Butternut squash polenta, kale and shitake mushroom side, and a perfectly seared yet perfectly pink pork chop. My dining companion (oh yea, forgot about him for a minute while making love to my pork chop - hi!) was happy with his duck, but seemed envious of my love affair with my dear pork chop. I don't blame him. I am envious of my Sunday evening self right now too. In other words, abso-effing-lutely. A few randomly useful tips:* Spontaneous as we were, we didn't have a reso but were nonetheless able to snag a seat at the chef's table (read: bar) when we walked in at 6 pm. The place quickly filled to the brim, so reservations are a must. I am told that if you mention you are a neighborhood resident, they squeeze you in. We didn't need to play the Neighbor Card, but I will give it a try sometime. * The entrance is not on Hudson, but right around the corner (Morton I think? I never pay attention because even after over a year of being a West Villager I still get distracted by all the fun things to look at while walking through the nabe) through a little courtyard. * Attire seems wear-what-you-will.

After doing the polite thing and waiting for 5 minutes as the ""host"" (clad in a plaid shirt) spoke to the waitress, I was annoyed. Both had seen us and decided to continue speaking without a better acknowledgment than a glance. The fault is with the host, because he's front of the house and should've checked the waitress, but her behavior also just indicated a lack of accommodation. Service is not egalitarian, but it can certainly be mutually respectful. Thankfully, dinner took a turn for the better. We shared the arugula salad and buttered clams with gnocchi appetizer. And by share, I mean, I had the salad, clams and greens from the appetizer and he had the gnocchi. The salad's flavor profile sounded really promising, but I think the ""spiced"" walnuts were just a little too mellow in contrast to a green like arugula. I am not sure if the arugula should be replaced or if the walnuts should be kicked up. The clams appetizer was great, clams were fresh and plump, very clean tasting dish without being bland. I took the appetizer as entree (or as Aziz likes to call it - tre tre) strategy and had the lemon cured duck leg. The duck leg was served on a bed of creamy corn. The skin was perfectly crispy, it's something between a confit and a fried chicken leg. Not greasy, again, very clean tasting but flavorful. (You know what I mean about duck? It's almost like a horrible body odor sometimes.)He had the steak which was ""tender"". We finished off with the dark chocolate cherry ganache with fresh berries, orange and pear.

Our waiter Roi was friendly.  We had arranged to meet an additional person at another bar later on this evening.  We were handed our dessert menus....and waited.  We waited sooo long to place our dessert order that our other friend arrived and we still had not ordered.  So we brought him to our 4 top and politely requested that a 5th chair be brought over and told the waiter we were ready to order our desserts.  He went off to ask the Maitre 'd for a chair.  Meanwhile we asked the kind lady sitting at the next table if we could possibly borrow her chair as no one was using it.  She complied.  Still waiting for someone to take our dessert order.  By now its been more than 25 min.  Suddenly, Justin the skinny maitre d with the oversized glasses comes to our table demanding that our friend get up from the chair.  ""you do realize you can't use this chair.  I'm going to need it in a few moments.  Since the only one using the chair was a pocketbook we didn't see the problem. A second person came over and also rudely insisted that our one friend get up as he needed that chair now.  We politely suggested that if someone would finally take our order that we would be out of their hair ASAP.  At that point we ordered 3 desserts and two coffees. When the desserts finally arrived we ate quickly so as to not annoy Justin or the other manager who refused to give us his name.any further.  When we were just about finished Justin or the other guy( they looked very much alike) came back to the table and berated us and repeatedly insisted we get up and sit at the 6 top behind us.  We said that since we were almost done that it seemed excessive to move us all since we would be gone in less than 5 minutes.  He then told us ""We are lucky they even allowed us to have the 5th person sit with us.  The arrogance and complete disregard for polite demeanor finally got to us and he stated that he had a large party of 8 so that they needed both 4 tops put together.  We moved ate our three bites that were left and at that point realized it was not a party of 8 it was 2 separate parties.  One of 3 people, the other 2 people.  Since the 6 top we had been forced to move to was actually 3 tables pushed together I'm still perplexed as to the reason why we moved.  We paid tipped our waiter 20%.  We were again approached by Justin or the other one and told that ""We should consider ourselves lucky they even allowed our fifth person to sit there and not eject him.  This is after spending $265.00.  I made several more attempt to explain had they taken our order a 30 min earlier when we asked for the menus we would have been gone by the time the fifth person arrived it would have been a non issue.  He looked down at me and his most contemptuous arrogant voice said"" well, since the waiter insists that he tried to take your order several times and you refused we'll have to look at the security camera to see who is lying"". I don't care how packed your restaurant  is or how cutting edge  you THINK your menu might be.  There is simply no excuse for such egregious attitude and complete disregard for social skills.  The food was certainly not good enough to warrant such arrogance on the part of Justin the maitre d or his doppelgänger cohort who blatantly refused to divulge his name.  I nor will any of my friends will ever enter the premises again.  Additionally, the decor was like a dirty poorly decorated backyard.   The unmarked bathrooms were filthy and did not lock properly.  Somehow I think there must be a couple of pretentious, hipster hangouts where the food is better and the people actually understand the concept of manners especially n the food industry.  Don't bother th food is not anywhere as good to justify such behavior.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

I liked how the menu was short and simple.  I'm always wary when I see menus that make everything good (but nothing great?).  I was torn between the steak and the duck and I went with the former.  The clams were very buttery, perhaps a little too much.  I found myself trying to squeeze the butter out with my fork, but they still had a lot of flavor to them.  The main course was absolutely delicious.  My wife prefers the leaner meat of tenderloin compared to pork belly.  My preference would have always been with the fattier and juicier belly, but the tenderloin was perfect.  The bacon sprinkled on the dish definitely pushed the dish from excellent to perfect.  The medium rare steak was just as good and cooked and flavored nicely.  The leek and watercress was a nice compliment to all the meat we were eating.  The cauliflower puree was very good and the flavor was enhanced by the almonds.  Not a dessert person, I always had the thinking, if you're not full before dessert, then there's something wrong with your entrée.  The service was excellent.  The host greeted you on the way in and out.  It is definitely a plus to feel welcome to a restaurant.  The waitress helped my wife and I take photos and was more than happy to take more when the first shot didn't come out well in the dark.  The chef even offered a small tasting of another appetizer, which was always very good! The meal was perfect and I really was happy to take my wife to celebrate an important occasion.  On a side note, the basement had a big table for 8-10 guests.  It's always from the noise and crowds of upstairs, so definitely a place to be loud and obnoxious with several close friends.  Definitely a place to consider for a birthday celebration!",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Impressive little list. I went for the Duchess (I've been into gin-based cocktails lately...) and it was a hit. Not overly sweet (which I can't tolerate) and great flavor.Step 2: Apps. I wasn't particularly wowed by any of the apps, so opted to share salads to start. The Arugula was phenomenal. Walnuts, St. Andre cheese, lightly dressed... mmm! The Watercress was just ok. I'm no watercress expert but as a base for a salad, it was like eating little trees...Step 3: Entrees. I chose the Pork Tenderloin with Mushrooms, Beans and Bacon (oh, and more little trees). The pig-on-pig was a no-brainer, and it was everything I dreamed it would be. The loin lived up to its tenderness, and the house-cured bacon was a perfect accent. I also tasted the Hanger Steak, which would have been great, except for the over-saltedness (my pet peeve).I skipped on the sides, but would like to try a few next time. Yes, there will be a next time... I also hope that next time they will not be ""sold out"" of their Pinot Noir by the glass, or at least they will offer to open one of the 3 other Pinots on their bottle list (yes 3 others, and no they were not an option)...Other thoughts: good/cool crowd (some old but mostly young); definitely a solid date spot; attractive staff; reasonably priced. It's a must-try.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Tip of the day:  The entrance is on Morton St, not Hudson.What a cute restaurant! Greeted by a small gardened yard and attractive wait staff, how can you not like this place?  What is it about hidden places that pique the new yorker's interest?  Trying to avoid my all time go to meat - duck, I ordered the hanger steak.  As Dan T notes, it was quite a generous cut and executed very well.  However, I would have preferred it if my boyfriend's duck breast was on my plate instead -- I can't help it, I love duck.  The olive oil cake was a bit odd for dessert, and personally thought they should have made an olive oil ice cream to pair with it.

The setup is ok/cool, the no sign, random entrance... I like it but kinda getting old, it kept the 5th star as the staff was very nice, talkative, and on the ball. I was here on a weekday, on the early side after work and there was no-one in the place. By 7:30 the bar was packed and every seat was taken. I ordered the steak dish, and it was cooked perfectly, over the best tasting Kale I've ever had. (I pride myself on making Kale taste good when I cook at home using bacon.) The gratin was equally good, a dish simply done perfectly.

I can forgive a lot if I am in a great space with good service, but no need here. Everything we had was fantastic. We started with the squash dumplings, which were savory bites of heaven, and had the creamy polenta side as a starter as well. Following a few other Yelp reviewers, I had the duck, which was incredible, and the bread pudding for dessert.

Iit's on Morton St, second door (i think its green...) from NW corner that leads to an open courtyard garden--which looks perfect for some al fresco dining or drinks.  It's a bit tight inside the resto but manages to stay ""cozy"" rather than claustrophobic. There's counter dining in front of the open kitchen, and on the lower landing another bar which slowly filled up as the night progressed.  I think the resto is much too small to just stand around the bar for a drink as it feels a bit awkward if you are dining at a table down there but people seemed to not mind it.  Very nice ambiance and vibe for a date, but also ideal for small groups.Food is superb, especially every LAMB dish they have.  Salad watercress, basil, candied lemon, roasted beets, croutons, goat cheese was decent but Spring veggie pot pie, Lemon-cured Duck leg, butter clams + gnocchi apps were winners!

Had a late reservation, once we found our way through the secret green door around the corner, the staff was very accommodating & friendly. Duck confit app was delicious, cornbread and cranberries gave it a rich, sweet scrumptiousness. I got a pork chop special entree-- another unusual blend of ingredients (shiitake mushrooms, blood oranges) made for an unusually delicious meal. My date's sea bass was a great cut of fish, but slightly overwhelmed by the mashed rutabaga it was served with-- our only complaint (a mild one) about the food. With a sort of farmhouse-chic decor, low lighting, and a great playlist on the not-too-loud speakers, the ambiance was cozy and comfortable, good for a date or dinner with friends.

We came here for our 6 month anniversary and I had imagined a delicious, home-style farm to table experience, with vegetables shining through and plates that rose beyond the sum of their parts.What we got was much less than that - there were fresh vegetables, but the flavor combinations were maddeningly incomplete, or tone-deaf. Imagine mexican corn (with paprika, and some sort of mayonnaise...umm yum) completely overrun by terribly bitter sauteed radicchio. A strudel of fennel that had no flavor except for the dough, sitting in a red paste that had nothing - no flavor at all. Or how about a duck breast atop too few potatoes, screaming for some sauce to tie it all together (I initially thought the kitchen forgot to add it). Or a blackberry peach cobbler that didn't have nearly enough cobbler and peaches that had absolutely no flavor. I don't get it - this place seemingly has a lot going for it - cute, tucked away location, amiable JCrew model servers..and yet the only words I can think of to describe the culinary experience is aggressive. misguided, and immature. With some tweaks the kitchen could turn out truly complete dishes, and make this the nourishing place I had hoped for.Sorry to dump but it really fell short of expectations, especially for such an occasion.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

My three friends and I stumbled in late one weeknight right around when the restaurant was shutting down. We quickly apologized and turned to leave, but the staff invited us in and told us the kitchen wasn't closed quite yet. In an effort to make it easy on the cooks and the waitress, we quickly ordered some dishes to share. They were promptly brought out to our wooden, candle-lit table. If I were to go again, I'd order the duck and the cheese plate once more. The duck melted when the skin was broken open with a fork and the cheese selection (particularly the bleu) complemented the duck.

Take a right into a garden terrace and on your right will be the front door. When you walk in you will pass the bar and downstairs is where they have their more intimate rooms and dining areas. As it was my birthday, I reserved the private wine cellar downstairs, but you eat anywhere else here and leave just as happy.To start the night, we ordered a few cocktails: the Hemingway was quite strong, while the Lolita was on the sweeter side and worth a taste. Their prosecco was also light and of good quality.When it comes to the food, the portions are sized well and are more or less filling, though they leave you with just enough room for dessert. We were first given a crouton sampling, compliments of the chef, which was served with a light but savory side. As for the main course, I ordered the only vegetarian entree, the Toasted Farro, which comes highly recommended. The vegetables were seasoned well and were paired well with one another and with the prosecco. The parmesan is what brings it all together. Friends recommend either the Duck Breast or the Hanger Steak if you're looking to satisfy your appetite.We didn't order dessert, but revisiting the menu, I wish we did! Next time I will sample and report back.

The Hudson Mule was out of this world delicious. Absolutely worth the $12 charged.Next, the salads. I like a good salad, but it's rare that I really get excited about a mouthful of cold vegetables. This was not the case at Hudson Clearwater. The arugula salad with spiced walnuts and pear was a hit both times I ate here. Light, crisp, and refreshing.The butter clams and vegetable pot pie were also pretty good, though a bit heavy, so count on sharing if you want to have a comfortable amount of room left for your entree.

You will want a comfortable amount of room left for your entree!)I have tried both the hangar steak and the pork tenderloin, and I am still amazed at how inexpensive both dishes are considering the very high quality of the food.

I knew with the first bite of the summer veggie pot pie, the duck dish, and a few bites of my friends' pike and steak dishes that Hudson Clearwater would be one of my favorite restaurants. 1. Food: absolutely delicious, unanimously concurred. Summer veggie pot pie: creamy, savory, scrumptious. Duck: cooked medium, tender, with a wonderful progression of the sweet and salty in every mouthful. The day's special was a pike dish, and it was tender, flaky, and tasty. The hangar steak was nicely charred on the outside, and flavorful on the inside. And none of those measly delicate portion sizes here. I don't think this kitchen can do any wrong. The Lolita drink was so good everyone ordered the gin concoction. Even me, and I generally dislike and avoid the taste of alcohol. So there you have it ladies and gents, a great value and wonderful menu. 2. Service: lovely and not intrusive at all. Good-looking WV staff, too!3. Atmosphere: bustling bi-level restaurant with outdoor garden area. Exposed kitchen, lots of liveliness and animated conversations = loud. Lots of girls nights out, and a smattering of dates.

So many just dial it up and deliver 3 star meals. So refreshing when I stumble on the real deal. And this is the real deal. Great space - quiet garden seating for warm weather, a chef counter with limited table seating in the semi-raised area, then a few steps down to the bar and main table seating. We at at the chef counter this time and it was perfect. We had the corner stools by the open door leading to the garden providing a refreshing breeze and a panoramic view of the rest of the diners. And, of course, its always fun to watch the cooks in action. We started with the kale and beet salads. The kale was the only non-5 star dish and that is really a personal taste issue - a little citrus for my liking. The beet salad, on the other hand, egad... so delicious. For entrees, I had the tuna special and my friend had the hanger steak. The tuna was perfect - rare on the inside with seared sides providing texture. When dipped in the slightly hot sauce and speared with a snow pea pod... heavenly. I personally am not a hanger steak fan - too stringy - but Hudson's version was well above average. To top it all off, they delivered the best Dark and Stormy ever. Total tab before tax/tip with the D&S and 2 glasses of wine was $124-----------------------2/13/16 Visiteturn?

Chocolate brownie: ummmm I've had betterDrinks: Good mixed cocktails but seemed expensive for what we got. Service: Our server was very nice, but the service was super slow. Drinks took a very long time, food was ok turnaround, it took a long time for water, and to clear the plates, very lax.  Location/Ambience: Very nice, dark, romantic, trendy. Good for a date.

Simple but delectable- Mixed greens special salad was simple, light and tasty- Split the steak .... the chimichurri sauce (that creates a smokiness) may not be for everyone, but I was a fan...and the steak itself was basically butter.- We ordered the lemon bar and dark chocolate ganache dessert. The lemon bar was a real standout. The dark chocolate was good, but perhaps a bit intense.- Oh yeah, the Lolita cocktail was refreshing and a great apertif.- On the per-glass, the malbec went great with the steak, we were 50-50 on the pinot noir, but the grenache was simple and yummyAll-in-all, a really good experience and would go definitely go back.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

353,wjYHw8kH-_s1HdI8pBnZKg,Sasha B.,5.0 star rating,"NOM NOM NOM....There is no better way for this yelper to celebrate her birthday than a 5 star meal in one of nyc's hottest speakeasy restaurant. This was right up my alley. We were able to get a table for two on the same day but we had to chose either 6:15 or 9:30pm. The place is pretty small so I recommend making reservations at least a day in advance to get a reasonable time. Like others may have said, its helpful to note the actual entrance is on the side corner through the courtyard on Morton St, not on actual Hudson like the address suggests.When I got there I had a drink at the bar which only has about 7 seats but they fill up quickly around happy hour time, it was a mix of local having an after work drink and some eating at the bar. Had the hudson mule which was good, refreshing, and the candied ginger was a nice touch. My only complaint is that when the ice started melting it got kind of watery. My friend had the Calacas and it was great a little spice a good strong drink to be sipped slowly and enjoyed just how I like it.My friend and I shared 4 plates so I got a good feel for the menu and everything was on point! To start they brought out a little sample from the chef of quinoa in a yogurt sauce with cucumber and nuts and it was phenomenal! I highly suggest they put it on the menu, great for summer time. Then we had the gnocchi with clams and this was great as well (probably my favorite thing of the night), the clams are already preshucked so you don't have to deal with the shells, but it comes with this rich delicious broth and they only give you two crostinis so we had to ask for more. Next we had the pork belly appetizer which was as big and as filling as an entree (minus the price tag of an entree). My favorite part about the pork belly was the polenta mash that was under it, it wasn't your typical yellow flavorless polenta it was delicious. Next was the duck and brussel sprouts side dish, the only thing I would not get again was the brussel sprouts but maybe it was just a matter of preference. The brussel sprouts were very finely chopped up with sundried tomatoes and in some light sauce that I found to be pretty flavorless and it made me feel like it was frozen brussel sprouts with the residual water after heating. But again like I said my friend loved so I think I just prefer the more oven toasted crispy whole brussel sprout. The duck was good, one of the best ducks I've had (far better than macao trading co) and the skin was lightly toasted. I just wish the skin a tad crispier. For desert we had the chocolate ganache which was very light, which was ok with me because by this point I was stuffed, it was like 5 little pieces of rich fudge with fresh raspberries which hit the spot. The service was good, attentive and the waitress was helpful in suggesting things. Side note: the staff was all very good looking kinda hipster. The only weird thing is we didn't have one consistent waiter but instead like 6 different people that came to our table.Would definitely come back, especially in the summer time to eat in the courtyard. Food was great and not too expensive by NYC standards. Great place to wow a date or take an out of towner.

354,NxdIBd2N33DvnDOkLNC0xQ,Lisa Y.,3.0 star rating,"The Hudson Clearwater is a cute little boite doing its hidden hideaway speakeasy thing to perfection.  You have to find the entrance which is most of the fun and then figure out which door is the right one to make your entrance.  I am pretty sure which ever one you pick you will feel you picked wrong, which is also part of the fun.The drinks are interesting and though there are no strange elixirs there are plenty of additions of weird ingredients.  The finished product tastes great but you can almost read the tedium in the bartender as you order one of these hard to make mix ups.  I am pretty sure he would have liked me better had I just gone with a scotch rocks.  The bar stools are the cheapest and hardest  ones available and you won't want to drink two drinks cause it is pretty uncomfortable. However, I may return in the Spring when the garden is open.  It's always nice to sip outdoors in this indoor city.This is a little celebrity hideout and the night we were there we saw Brian Grazer eating with the EVP Head of Casting for ABC.  The next day Brett Ratner ""resigned"" from producing the Oscars.  So, I guess Brian was going over some host/presenter ideas with the ABC big wig.  Fun job, if you can get it!",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"
355,3jwjEz5i-bACd0183gFXRA,Jonathan H.,3.0 star rating,"Ate here last night with a party of four.The whole mysterious door thing wasn't half as cool as people make it out to be. It's a door to a courtyard to the back/front(?) door of the restaurant. I guess they are going for a Chumley's type of entrance but I am still not convinced it was by design more than out of necessity and function. Regardless, it is a novelty and people love novelties.As SOON as we entered the inside, we loved the place. We were greeted immediately by two gentlemen (owners?) and escorted to the bar. The bartender worked hard and was social at the same time. He did his job very well.  The place is ascetically pleasing with an open kitchen and nice tables and chairs. Whomever laid this place out, seemed to know what they were doing. Just the right amount of form versus function. When the rest of our party arrived, we were seated exactly on time by one of the friendly owners. Here is where it starts to go downhill a little. I had read the Yelp reviews that the waitresses are bad and I always give all servers the benefit of the doubt but the service was lacking in a lot of departments.  Looking around for the answer, i don't know if it is 100% the server's fault but she was to blame as well.  There doesn't seem to be much structure here. There are two managers on the floor who seem to constantly keep crossing paths and stepping on each others' toes and the staff looks like they have no direction.Everyone was nice and smiley and that was great but we probably would have had a couple more drinks if the service was more attentive. Onto the food: We ordered salads and hot apps. They came at the same time.  When I asked Matt (owner) about if this was typical, he said that his partner took full responsibility for the confusion and it was probably because a lot of people don't order a salad and an appetizer. Either or. :-O What? The waitress had previously told us they were running out of room on the pass and she had to bring them all at once. Regardless of why, we had salad and apps on the table at the same time. Matt apologized and gave us complementary dessert. One thing I can say about this place is that management looks like they are clearly TRYING but they need to enable and train staff a little better so they don't have to touch every table.The arugula salad and the raw endive salad were both passable. I guess there is a reason no other Yelper mentioned them.Buttered clams were tasteless. Soft and buttery but tasteless. No salt and pepper on the table which would have helped.Cheddar shortcake was different. The horseradish was a nice touch and the dish was memorable because of it.The Duck leg Confit was PERFECT! It was cooked perfectly. It tasted amazing. The accompanying caramelized turnips were just right. This dish was the star of the meal by far. I would eat this every day. It really was that good.Entrees & Sides:EVERYTHING was cold except the Brussel sprouts side and the Sea Bass (just the fish. the accompany brussel sprouts were cold) & the two other proteins. Sea Bass - It was really good. Skin was perfectly cooked. Nice flavor and salt level.  Something I could eat again.Pork Tenderloin (Not the belly) - Also cooked very well. Tasty but disappointing when you are looking forward to delicious Pork belly for a week. Good nonetheless.Hanger Steak was cooked to a perfect medium.Whoever was cooking the proteins was spot on. The sides...not so much.The place was busy and that is great but it didn't seem like the expediter had full control over the line. It doesn't help that there was either a manager or owner two feet from him at all times.The comped deserts (Thank you again Matt!) were forgettable.After reading previous reviews, we were looking forward to them but the tarte tatin lacked any discernible flavor (maybe some cinnamon, or ice cream ?)Butternut squash cake was dry as dry could be and again with no sauce (was the citrus buttercream missing?)The Ganache was too big and too heavy to be considered a good ganache. No sauce again. We weren't exactly sure why there were segmented orange slices on all the dessert plates also. They worked with the ganache but were out of place on the other too.Conclusion:The food is lacking for sure but there is a lot of potential here. The ambiance was great and the energy level was super high. Not pretentious at all and the overall dining experience was a good one but the wait staff needs improving. For both the diners' sake and the owners' sake.The value is great as the food prices are reasonable and the drink prices are MORE than reasonable. Bottom line is that this place was packed and it seems like management is trying really hard to run a great restaurant.

Rustic vibe, not a lot of space but I didn't feel cramped or that I was eating with another couple of strangers which is often the situation with the village scene. That said, it felt like there were more employees than patrons. You're greeted at the door by 3 people, there are 2-3 bartenders, and 3-4 waitresses, etc. The good: Drinks were a little pricey ($26 a round) which was expected but they were fairly strong and good overall. I had the volver which I highly recommend. We started with crab cakes as appetizers. They were tasty but not very hot (temperature wise). However, the saffron aioli & onion jam made this a great dish and we were satisfied with it. We also ordered a side of potato gratin and had the bread pudding for desert, both of which were also excellent and both were recommendations from our waitress. Speaking of the staff...the staff was very attentive which is great if we needed something every 5 minutes...The badThe staff was very attentive. It was a full court press as soon you get there. You're greeted by 3 people as soon as you walk in. A few  minutes after I arrived I forgot something in my car and my way out the same staff wished me a good night...One of the greeters would sneak in and out of the restaurant and take your drink when you weren't finished, or grab your plate when you weren't done. They were definitely trying to move tables and didn't care if it was apparent. After ordering desert, a waitress dropped the bill on the table without us asking for it. Didn't ask ""can I get you anything else?"" which is a pet peeve of mine when you're paying $175+ for a meal. She did however ask if we needed change two times  within approximately 5 minutes after leaving the bill on our table however we hadn't even look at it yet.We both had the duck entre. Mistake.

I liked the open kitchen in the restaurant and the wooden decor with dim lighting.The service was friendly, but our waitress was reading/mumbling the specials off her note pad which was kind of awkward and distant. The food: We started with the lentil salad with beet puree. The puree was a bit strong, so if you are a beet lover than this is perfect for you. We both ordered fish, the seabass and the walleye pike special. Both filets were cooked perfectly, however, the herbs and ingredients chosen to accompany them were very odd. I was most excited for the potato-cauliflower gratin and the potatoes and cauliflower didn't really mesh and it tasted like two different dishes.The place was fun and the food wasn't BAD it just wasnt amazing!

Service could be a little more sparkling. I walked in to meet a large group and no one really offered to show me where they might be (they were downstairs in a tiny private wine room).

378,LIOQdSLLfAetXDH75SKQQg,Nancy D.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 Stars*I will have to thank my roommate for suggesting such an adorable spot for our catch up session. If you want a cute place to chat with a girlfriend over drinks and dinner in the West Village, Hudson Clearwater is a perfect spot. The restaurant is almost always fully seated (although the bar area consistently seems to have a couple of open seats), so the sound level is buzzy, but never deafening. The last thing I want to do when I'm catching up is yelling ""WHAT???"" every few minutes. I much prefer the bar seating over the table seats since the wait time is cut down drastically. The entire menu is accessible at the bar - there is almost no point in waiting if you are a party of two. Also, the bartenders look like they've come straight out of a high fashion lookbook...I think this eye candy is probably the reason why I spotted Cindy Barshop (ex-Real Housewives of NYCer) and her lady friend lingering slowly over their glasses of wine. I've come on several occasions and I've determined that my favorite cocktail at Hudson Clearwater is the Damson Sour. If you enjoy pisco sours, you will enjoy the restaurant's twist on the classic drink. I've had the Butter Clams, Pork Tenderloin, and the Paremesan Polenta. All delicious! Clams in a buttery broth filled with gnocchi sounds bizarre, but it is surprisingly good! *Will Yelp ever allow me to give half stars? :(",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

I ordered the banana bread pudding for dessert as I was so hungry, which was OK, although I had to ask for extra chocolate sauce on the side, which was a nice addition.

My summary is that it's my favorite of any restaurant I've tried in months, fantastic food, cocktails, and reasonable wine list.

Didn't specify a time since they do tend to get busy, so I figured they would throw me what times they had available. Got a 9:30 reservation.When we got there we entered through the door on the side of the building - it is the second door on the side of the building which leads into the patio area that you go through - nothing is labeled but sometimes the door is open and otherwise you will hear people on the other side. When we got there, the place was packed and we had to wait a few minutes to be seated while another table left. While they were very nice and apologized for our wait (no more than 10 minutes), the only downside is that the bar area is VERY small and on a Saturday night you feel like you're in everyone's way.With that said, we were seated - I ordered a Manhattan which was very well done, and a bottle of wine. I ate the duck, which was great. Everyone else in my part enjoyed their food. One comment about this place is that everyone in there is good-looking to the point that it's kind of weird. The bartender, waitress/waters, and all of the patrons were, like, model hot.Overall, this was a great place. I'd recommend it for dinner rather than getting drinks at the bar, but that's what I think they intend to be their business model anyway.

For dessert: chocolate brownie with fresh berries, apple tarte, and lemon bar were all ridiculously good with a perfect balance of sweet and tart. And the prices were very reasonable for food and drinks.The setting was fun, well-designed with different levels, great lighting and music, and though it was packed, we could all hear eachother at the table without yelling.

Thank heavens for yelp, I only looked like kind of an idiot trying to find the entrance - to reiterate, take a right on Morton from Hudson and go into the second green door. I know, right?! The food at Hudson Clearwater was delicious. I had the black sea bass and it was phenomenal. You are always seeing chefs talking on TV (well I am, I love food TV shows) about crispy skin and how important it is. This is probably the first time in my life that I ate a piece of bass with a perfectly crispy skin, and now I know why they are always obsessing over it, because it really makes a dish. Oh man, it was incredible. I couldn't even speak when it came, I just had to focus. Then when it was gone even though I was full I felt so sad. And for around $20, you just cannot beat that. The only reason I do not think Hudson Clearwater deserves five stars is that it is just a tiny bit cramped and once they figure out that you aren't going to spend a crapload of money the service I felt was somewhat dismissive.

I emailed the restaurant 15 days ahead of our reservation request and got a reply to with telling me reservations are taking two weeks ahead of time. So I called the next day and made a reservation for a Saturday at 8 o'clock four people.  Despite making the reservation two weeks ahead of time I was greeted three days prior to our arrival with a phone call saying that there was a mixup with the reservations and that they could no longer honor our reservation time and at the restaurant was completely booked for Saturday.  Having worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years, this seems very suspicious to me, particularly because it took so long for them to contact me with this mistake. They did offer to make alternate reservations at another restaurant, but couldn't necessarily say at that time what the restaurant would be.Ultimately they did make us a reservation for the night before, but that doesn't work with our plans so we will not be dining at Hudson Clearwater. I am sure the restaurant is amazing and the food is very good. However, any long-lasting restaurant understands the importance of every step in the process.

The staff is very hip and attractive, but the host especially didn't seem to know what he was doing most of the time.  He kept giving us the wrong menus (lunch for both dinner and then dessert), and the waitress would return with correct menus, and apologize.  After we finally ordered, we asked for some bread - as we were starving, and she said they could serve it as a ""side"".  Our food was very good - charred octopus app, and the duck and gnocchi entrees were very tasty.   After getting the correct menus sorted out for dessert, the cheesecake with gooseberries was fabulous.  Because I'm a fan of the food, I guess I'd come back again to see if the service was any better, and maybe we should feel lucky that they comped our $5 bread...right?  I'm guessing this place might make a better brunch spot, but I'd give it another try.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

It was very crowded but the wait was not so long for 2 of us, we were seated and greeted w brief intro of the restaurant: it was newly opened for less than a month, dinners only Tue-Sat, but they will expand to open 7 days and do brunch.  We had grilled scallop special for appetizer, first of all, it was prepared and served in such aesthetic way that I feel guilty eating them. OMG, it was the best scallop I ever had, soft, moist and flavorful.  Speaking of guilt, my gf had pork belly for her entree, let me tell you something, it was one hell of a dish that we both concur we'll die very happy if this was our last meal which causes our arteries to clot! But that wouldn't be the case so we'll definitely go back!  I had grilled hang steak which was very tender and juicy, oh I cannot tell you in words how good the gratin was, I just wanted to have more! You've been warned that the portion is quite small, then again, the quality is exceptional, and the service's perfect.  Even though there was full house, we were treated very friendly, our server gave good recommendations, short wait for the food and water glass was always filled.  We had lemon bar and butter squash for dinner, the lemon bar was so refreshing and tantalizing!  It was such a great experience at Clearwater w food, service and ambiance.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

Um, hi, how about a WELCOME, nice to have ya? I'm not even a Southerner, people, but come on, have some more hospitality than that. We sat and had a few drinks.. I had a really interesting beet juice cocktail with jalapeno tequila, then switched to a less intense mezcal cocktail. We ordered the beet salad & the butter clams, which were both fantastic. The beets were yellow & red and tasted very fresh while the butter clams came in a ramekin warm with a buttery broth and soaking with fluffy gnocchi. A nice crostini came along with it to sop up the broth. We shared our entrees - the arctic char & the hanger steak with a side of eggplant ratatouille. Both were fantastic but I honestly can't remember details b/c by then I was supporting a nice buzz. At this point, they were already trying to take our plates from under us and I had to tell the waitstaff twice that we we not finished yet. It was 8:30 pm at this point. So annoying.

My favorite part of the meal, however, was the dessert. The apple tarte tatin with creme fraiche, and the dark chocolate and cherry ganache were divine.Though the best thing about this place is definitely the atmosphere! Hidden behind a courtyard, it has such a wonderful air of mystery. Yet inside is anything but: warm and cozy with exposed brick and fantastic lighting.

Very typical cute West Village restaurant - cozy and warm.The food - delicious. No complaints about ANY of the things that we got (both of the clam appetizers, brussel sprouts, steak, chocolate bread pudding). Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly.The drinks - some of the best drinks I've ever had. I got the Hudson Mule - very delicious.The waiters - ahh....you would think that for a restaurant of this calibre that the waiters would be a little more organized...but alas, no. We had 3 different waiters throughout the night...although, the one that we ended getting most of our food from was great. But the first two waiters had NO idea what they were doing. It took them almost 10 minutes to even come over and give us water. On top of that, it took them another 10 minutes to come back and see if we had any questions about the menu. The host was nowhere near the front of the restaurant so it took them nearly 10 minutes to seat us for a reservation we were on time for. The host then told us to wait at the bar saying that: ""the table will be ready whenever the tables clear up..."" - very vague and unclear. I didn't know if I was supposed to get a drink or not. So I didn't. After waiting 10 minutes, during which I could easily have had a drink, the host finally comes back over and tells me not to get a drink as the table is almost ready...All in all, the food and the drinks make it a worthwhile experience, but I don't think I'll be back again.

Ok great, I thought, downstairs (3 or 4 steps) in the sunken dining room, nice!!!  NO, downstairs in the basement next to boxes of wine and the toilets (AND - there were available two-tops in the ""sunken dining room"" upstairs).  I was appalled and insulted (I have been living downtown for 18 years, come-on), but wanted to behave in front of my friend, therefore I did not complain.  There was another couple seated down there but no one else.  The wait staff kept coming to the basement to grab bottles of wine from the stacks of boxes on the wall next to our table.  CLASSY!!! I am not sure if they were trying to create a ""hipster""experience by having tables in the basement or it just was in bad taste...!!!The food: my friend had the  grilled scallops to start and I had the aged white cheddar shortcake with roasted root vegetables and horseradish crème fraîche, 2nd course: I had the hanger steak, and he had the butternut squash risotto, we then shared the lemon bar to finish off the meal.  I was very impressed at how fresh everything was that we ate.  I do recommend ordering the grilled scallops (it was the appetizer special) because they melted in our mouths.  Everything else was very, very tasty.  Would I go back? hmmm, only if they promise not to stick me in the storage room the next time...(I did tell our very kind waitress my feelings about this).My advice - food is worth it, but if they try to seat you in the basement, tell them that you will wait for a better table UPSTAIRS.  Moral of the story, always ask for what you want!

The directions offered by other Yelp reviewers were helpful in finding the place. I wouldn't say it was difficult; there's a door leading to their outdoor dining area (on Morton St) on the northwest corner of Morton and Hudson.The place is tiny and my party of 2 was sat in about 10 minutes without a reservation; the caveat is that it is summer and a lot of the usual competition was probably in the Hamptons.I started with the vegtable pot pie. Not very impressive. Essentially a creamy broth with corn, beans, tomatoes etc. in a small bowl with an overlying puff pastry/crossant. My wife had a arrugala walnut pear cheese salad which was average.For my entree i had the duck breast which was cooked well with nive veggies on the side. I thought it could have used a little more juis. My wife had the cod which was very good and had an interesting sauce underneath - again, could have used more of the sauce.Overall the staff was friendly and attentive. I think it was generally okay, nothing special. I dont know if I would go back unless I happened to be in the neighborhood.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

460,AHPgq_U3LW-XjRc1sybGjA,KJ W.,4.0 star rating,"After reading conflicting reviews on this place, I had my expectations in check, but found I definitely didn't need to; every aspect of the experience was great. I love the atmosphere: small (wouldn't recommend going with more than four people in your party), intimate, dimly-lit with LOTS of candles (even on the stairs going down to the bathroom), nice light wood and brick exposure. Cool chef's bar.Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.Drinks: I usually don't drink specialty cocktails, and I always stay away from gin, but the Lolita sounded so good, I gave it a shot. I could easily drink buckets of this deliciousness on a rooftop pool. Or at the dinner table. But I stopped myself at one and moved on to wine. Strong wine list.For appetizers we got the brook trout, cheddar shortcake, and watercress salad. They first two were definitely good, but pretty low-impact. Salad was nice, but unremarkable. Entrees were all pleasing, too. I had the bass, which was cooked just right and served with delicious sides of brussel sprouts and smashed rutabaga. These sides were my favorite part of the meal. My friends loved their entrees, the duck and pork, which were both cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  So if everything was so great, why only 4 stars? Because nothing was absolutely, outstandingly, oh-my-stars superb, but it was all very pleasing. I would recommend it, especially for a romantic date.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"
461,5lttrFu3qYOjIGDkrNRgdw,Anna M.,5.0 star rating,"FAVORITE SPOT IN NYC. Yes that's a bold statement for NYC which has some of the greatest restaurants in the world. But on my last trip I found myself there several nights in a row, each time excited to try something new. I don't like the big touristy restaurants i prefer  the super hip tucked away joints with incredible food and sophisticated clientele. I also see a celeb or two hiding out in this place eating the incredible steaks and seafood. I just hope too many people find out about it...Try everything and then come back and try the rest. It doesn't hurt that the owners are four cool guys who love their customers as much as their food. You know they care because even the owners bus their own tables and come by personally. Get to know them.There are only a few of these hidden jems left in NYC.

Food was lovely as was the atmosphere....but the way we were treated was outrageous. Rushed the whole meal and then kicked out for another reservation which was an outrage with no warning when we had a reservation for a group. When I discretely told the server that we were displeased she was incredibly defensive and made it worse. I will be calling tomorrow to speak to a manager.

The place is nice...the food is good...and the drinks are fun....but way too much attitude and over priced (different than 'expensive').  Plus, over the pain with 'getting a table' and where to sit and blah blah blah. Plenty of spots that they were 'holding' tables for reservations - which they say they don't take reservations. I mean - come on, folks. Dime a dozen - and the bartenders are only cute enough to keep our attention so long. Haha.

473,fzNESmFoBbCgNw3eQgzPkA,Sarah A.,3.0 star rating,"Hudson Clearwater is the kind of place to go with girlfriends, not with parents for someone's birthday. The service was excellent, and the food was overall very good, but the tables are a little cramped and the hipster vibe is a little much. I had the trout appetizer; maybe I've been watching too much top chef, but I thought the trout was overdone and the pastry crust was too heavy. Also, the caramelized onions were almost non-existent and there was too much of the slaw mixture on top of the tart. The crispy duck was excellent, although my husband thought his hanger steak was a little salty (as was his black-eyed pea bisque).Finally, we ordered two rounds of cocktails before we got our appetizers and there was never any bread, crackers, or anything on the table for us to munch on... maybe that's old-school, but we all inhaled our appetizers when we got them b/c we were starving and half in the bag. Also, the birthday dessert came without us even seeing the dessert menu, so the one measly lemon tart was passed around for six people.Overall, I'd say they have a few kinks to work out, but it has promise.

478,P7b2o0X8gcukl_l1eHaoJw,Aryanne F.,2.0 star rating,"My overall rating has much more to do with overly crass service than the food, which I admit, was excellent.  That said, the entire wait staff was pushy throughout our meal - busing dishes and drinks off the table that were clearly not yet finished, serving us our check with our desserts, and that's after having ordered QUITE heartily.  Exactly 2 hours after our reservation time, while still sipping our after-dinner drinks (yes, we ordered those too), we were told that our reservation time was up and that we needed to leave.  Mind you, no one told us we had a 2 hour limit, though they claimed to make this clear at time of reservation - sorry, but that just didn't happen.  Back to being asked to leave - there was no invitation to have a drink on the restaurant at the bar (which was so packed that it was pouring on to our table with everything from bags to body parts in our faces at several points throughout the meal), just a swift kick to exit, and to do so promptly.  The experience of what had truly been a delicious meal was unfortunately ruined.  Though I expressed disappointment at the way we had been treated, the host did nothing but continue his haughty demeanor.  Despite the quality of the food, I would not recommend this restaurant, nor will I return - nothing about it is so unique or earth shattering to make me want to subject myself to such a negative experience again.",Hudson Clearwater,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Wine, Bars"

The duck was tender with crispy skin and cooked to a perfect medium. The pork chop had great flavor, but was a bit tough. However, the crispy bacon, mushrooms, white beans and watercress on the bottom of the pork chop were delicious! We shared a side of julienned beets, which pleased our palate. Had a meyer lemon bar for dessert...let's just say, I'm still thinking about it right now. Overall, good food and great service.
