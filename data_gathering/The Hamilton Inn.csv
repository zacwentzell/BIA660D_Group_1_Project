It seems like this dish now comes with three crisps instead of how it previously came with two. ALOT more tuna tartare per crisp as well. Who can complain when you are getting more food than you actually had expected right?I tried the French Onion soup dumplings for the first time, and while the soup was delicious and cheesy, the dumplings themselves were super chewy. I had to basically eat around most of them. Overall would definitely come back, next time I want to try the eggs benedict!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I've heard a lot about this place throughout my time in JC and i thought I'd finally give it a shot. Service was subpar, I had drinks at the bar prior to sitting down and the gentleman who helped me was very apathetic and hard to get a hold of when I wanted to pay. After moving to the table we ordered a lot of food which was all decent, nothing exceptional though. Our server, though sweet was equally inattentive.I had to walk towards the back where she was rolling silverware to pay.Not worth it.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
2,QwS328Pn1xFKgp-Csrzivg,Abby L.,2.0 star rating,"My fiancè and i always pass by this place and decided to try it out for dinner this time. Walking in, we noticed it was a Cute place, with a nice ambience - low lighting w tealight candles at each table. There was no host in the front, so we looked to some of the employees to at least let the host know were waiting. They made eye contact with us and no one moved. Finally, when the host arrived, we were seated. Looking at the menu, i didnt expect for most of it to be sandwiches. There wasnt much entree choices. I dont know if they had dinner specials as they were not offered to us. So we just went with what they had on the menu.Appetizer: Truffled Egg Pizza $15... ""Sunny side egg, panchetta, spinach & mozz on pizza dough"". This was really good... egg was cooked well, crispy crust, oozy cheese and quite tasty. Since this was good, expectations were high for the main course.His order: The Inn Burger $12... ""100% Organic, brioche bun w Fries"". He wanted it cooked medium. Its a burger. Simple enough... how can they mess it up? When it arrived, at first sight.. it wasnt on a brioche bun, instead it was a sesame seed bun. The bun was very dry and a bit stale, so if it WAS a brioche bun, we couldnt tell. The Meat wasnt cooked as ordered... his burger was cooked medium well to pretty much well. He complained of the outside being burnt and ""charcoal-y"".  Needless to say, he barely ate his order.His extra side order: Mac n Cheese $9... tasted and looked like box mac n cheese topped with some grated cheese to make it look ""made from scratch"". It was bland and watery. My order: Salmon $27 ... ""Salmon w Butternut squash risotto & pumpkin seed oil"". When the dish arrived, all i noticed was a whole lot of risotto and a singular, piece of salmon that looked dry on top. The risotto was cooked well, but it couldve gone without the pumpkin seed oil. The salmon was okay... a bit over cooked, but still edible.All in all, we rated the foods taste (with the exception of the appetizer) and presentation was quite underwhelming. As you can see in the pictures, we didnt finish a good amount of our meal. It was definitley not worth the almost $80 check. The only reason we gave it 2 stars was for the appetizer and our waitress's good service.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I live very close by and have given it 4 or 5 tries giving them the benefit of the doubt maybe they've just had an off day.No. The staff here just literally can't cook. I should have known when they asked me ""how would I liked my turkey burger cooked""? Perhaps - cooked? Nearly everytime I'm there they've run out of several menu items (usually what I'm ordering) - and the servers never seem to know upfront.  Even basic bar food, like nachos, is bad.

Turns out the table was incredibly drafty and someone asked to switch, so they decided we were the ones to do it.  Fine, I lived with that.We ordered the french onion soup dumplings, which were REALLY good, but the portion was just too small for $12.  I ordered eggs Benedict solely because it came with homefries, and if I ordered them separately, it would have been an extra $5.  It was good, but nothing to write home about. My friends got the chilaquiles, which was definitely delicious and unique. One other friend got a meatball sub with truffle fries (which are also good, but I do not like truffle).Overall, I think it cost more than it was worth.  The $5 mimosas are good, but small.  I am not a cheap person, but this was a pricey place for average quality and portions.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It takes a special bartender to get this jusssttttt right and he got it justtttttt right! Great start before ordering food. We then split the french onion soup dumplings and the potato goat cheese perogis. Both were delicious and special shout out to the creativity of the french onion soup dumplings. Only thing I could suggest would be to get smaller spoon to fit in the holes of the escargot gratin dish to get all the broth. For entrees, I got the tuna burger with a side salad and P got fish tacos (3). Taco dish was way bigger than he expected. Flaky white fish and great accompaniments.

Then we were asked if we had a reservation which confused me because I was told t was first come first serve. So I promptly went on opentable and there was a reservation open at least every 15 mins so I promptly made one. We were finally seated and were told that the booster chair will be brought out shortly for my baby nephew. They mentioned that twice more but it never came which was not a big deal because the nephew found a way to entertain himself.

They have both outdoor and indoor seating (with lights decorating the outside) and a pretty expansive bar. My fiance ordered the Rueben and I got the Mexican Torta. My fiance thought his Rueben was okay - very oily, it was dripping while he ate it. The mexican torta was okay, I thought there were a bit too much crema sauce in my sandwich, which dulled a lot of the other flavors.Overall, not a bad spot.

Another time they gave me a gin drink when I asked for a vodka drink. What did it for us, again, was NYE pre-fix dinner. We had a 7:30 reservation and they had already ran out of the desserts.

What more could you ask for?The Hamilton Inn is a Jersey City staple, and after a few visits it's not surprising to see why. I've only ever been in for brunch, and the menu is phenomenal. You can take the brunch route and go with a classic like eggs benny or avocado toast or take the lunch route and enjoy anything from a lobster roll to a turkey burger. Basically - the menu has a ton of options.On my most recent trip, I ordered the truffled breakfast pizza. Confession, I had been drooling over the Instagram pics all morning. The insta-cravings delivered, and this pizza was nothing short of incredible. The egg and pancetta were crispy, and the melty cheese and spinach added the perfect texture. My mans went with the steak eggs benedict and finished every last drop. They've got some great brunch drink deals, and you can snag a mimosa, bulldog or bloody for 5 bucks.

Then we were asked if we had a reservation which confused me because I was told t was first come first serve. So I promptly went on opentable and there was a reservation open at least every 15 mins so I promptly made one. We were finally seated and were told that the booster chair will be brought out shortly for my baby nephew. They mentioned that twice more but it never came which was not a big deal because the nephew found a way to entertain himself.

You can take the brunch route and go with a classic like eggs benny or avocado toast or take the lunch route and enjoy anything from a lobster roll to a turkey burger. Basically - the menu has a ton of options.On my most recent trip, I ordered the truffled breakfast pizza. Confession, I had been drooling over the Instagram pics all morning. The insta-cravings delivered, and this pizza was nothing short of incredible. The egg and pancetta were crispy, and the melty cheese and spinach added the perfect texture. My mans went with the steak eggs benedict and finished every last drop. They've got some great brunch drink deals, and you can snag a mimosa, bulldog or bloody for 5 bucks.

Our experience with the brunch menu was just ok. We both had the breakfast burrito. It was a LOT of plain rice and black beans and a tiny amount of eggs and pico. We were both more than halfway through the day burrito before we found any eggs at all. It was a pretty mediocre black bean and rice burrito.  Could really benefit from eggs all through out and maybe some cheese or salsa or something bc it was so plain.

Additionally, the menu says Monday holidays will have brunch menu and prices but I guess New Years Observance day doesn't count as a holiday.

Our waiter was helpful and checked in on us. There's a liquid lunch special 12-4 pm with 5 dollar drafts and select wines. I got the grapefruit margarita which was delicious. We started off with truffle fries that we devoured in about 5 min. I got the veggie burger (in the menu it says on an English muffin but I asked for it on Chiabatta.) I ended up getting on a bread that the normal burgers were on but no complaints the bread was much tastier than any chiabatta I've had. The veggie patty itself too was very flavorful.

Then a bartender told us off for bothering the people next to us and moving the chair, which put a sour taste in all our mouths, so we immediately left.If a reservation is mandatory, fine, but don't say you'll accommodate walkins then. Don't tell us to pull up a chair to account for our whole party and have a different staff member yell at us for doing that. It makes you look extremely disorganized and it's rude.We did return because we were hoping to have a different experience.

Sometimes, however, you need to be reminded of the standout restaurants that started the trend. The Hamilton Inn is one of those, and it is as good as ever.First off, the bar & restaurant has the laid-back charm of the Hamilton Park section of JC.  It's pretty as a picture from the outside, and quaint and charming on the inside.  A full-sized oak bar is a great spot for an after-work drink and snack, and there are enough tables, arranged spaciously with plenty of elbow room, so the dining experience is spot on too. You're always greeted with a smile. We arrived early and took it upon ourselves to secure a lovely table in the front window. The service was professional from beginning to end.  Our appetizer (crab cakes) and our entrees (grilled Ahi tuna burger & roasted sweet potato salad with grilled hangar steak) were excellent. The dessert menu had some impressive offerings, but we were seriously too full.

Maybe it was my fault for ordering raw fish here but I hated it. They over-marinated it with soy sauce which either means that the fish isn't fresh, or they don't know what they're doing. The crispy wonton wrapper was a nice touch though. It was almost like an Asian flat bread but the tuna was executed very, very wrong.For my entree, I had the lobster risotto which I really enjoyed (so that's the reason behind the three stars - I hate one course but loved the other). It has corn in it, which was fresh and not canned because a lot of the kernels were still stuck together.For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate cake. I wasn't a huge fan but the only other choice was a banana cream pie and I'm not too fond on bananas.One thing that I didn't like was that the whole table has to do RW.

Their roasted sweet potato salad is always a winner, as are the potato and goat cheese pierogies! The most recent time I came around, he suggested we come in for Sunday brunch. We got seated right away at one of their outdoor tables after arriving around 1pm. You definitely catch a hipster vibe from the atmosphere and staff, but in a classy and tasteful way.GET THE BACON BLOODY MARY. Don't ask questions, just order one. You will thank me! They offer a fine red sangria, as well, if you're a wimp and spicy cocktails aren't your thing. We split the huevos rancheros (which was easily some of the best I've had) and chilaquiles - which comes with this perfectly seasoned chorizo alongside two fried eggs, torilla, pico de gallo, and queso fresco.

Right when we walked in, greeted by the host and sat us down right away even though we were 15 minutes early. While the menu looks superb, we were there for the restaurant week selection. We both ordered the Blue Point Oysters for the appetizer (6 per person!). I was debating between this and the salad but I'm so glad I made the Oyster decision :) SO good - also they run like $2.75 or something a pop. So, deal! For the entree I ordered the 100% plant based burger and my fiancé had the hanger steak. I've eaten a lot of burgers in my time and I must say, being that it was made of 100% plant ingredients, it blew my mind how similar the texture it is to beef, and you don't like like fat cow after eating the whole thing! It was one of the best burgers I've had, hands down. My fiancés hanger steak was cooked medium, and it was sooo juicy and tender - of course, 100% grass fed beef. Amazing. Both entrees came with crunchy outside fries. Dessert!! The menu had two options so naturally we ordered one of each :) flourless chocolate cake (SO rich and decadent served with ice cream) and banana cream pie (home made whipped cream topped with chocolate chips!) the crust was this amazing cinnamon/gingerish flavor - just supreme. This is one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant, in a long time.

My problem is that the menu is lacking in creativity and never changes (but for one or two swap outs). If you're gonna have a static menu, then you MUST have several daily specials to keep people coming back. I have lived here a year now and it's just too boring to have the same options every time, with nothing new to try.  Even specials like Tuesday lobster night need to be updated....lobster works great as a summer special. But mix things up for the winter! I feel like the chef is lazy...he created a menu once and taught everyone to cook it and now his work is done.  If i want the same menu every time for years and years, I'll just go to a diner.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We sat outside, which was very nice. After waiting a half hour past our reservation time, they put together this awkward table that didn't fit in the space (stairs jutted into the table) but the host attended to us until we fixed it ourselves. The lamb burger, French onion soup dumplings, and banana cream pie were great. Chilequiles and truffle fries were underwhelming. Our server wasn't that attentive (never came just to check on us or ask if we needed anything after taking our orders) but because we're not shy we yelled out to her as she went in and out the door and had everything we needed and she was very efficient. Overall we had a blast between great company, good food, and sitting outside on a gorgeous day. One quick note from a service expert (including managing a Michelin starred restaurant): I called hours before to say we were going to be 9 people instead of 8. The person who answered the phone instantly told me they would try and do it but we wouldn't get an added table. My tip : don't tell guests what you're NOT going to do for them, unless you absolutely have to. It was off putting. I know the tables are prime real estate during brunch. I wasn't asking for a whole new table for one person increase. Just say okay and do what you have to do. Large parties are coveted at restaurants and one extra person should be welcomed with open arms. They acted like I increased it by 5 people.

All restaurants seem to be closed and only open for dinner device and if they are open, steak is only in the form of a salad or protein in a sandwich, not the star it should be. We needed meat, as we often do when we galavant, so my mission was height with obstacles. Luckily, I found Hamilton Inn has a steak frites entree at this sparse time of day. Question of the hour: Was it good though? We arrived, had kind customer service, and chose outdoor seating. The ambiance indoors was hipster bar meets hipster brunch, wood everywhere, stylized industrial farmhouse modern interior, the tasteful usual when it comes to this area. We wanted sunlight with our steak, so outside seating it was. We ordered: one steak frites (medium rare) & one steak frites sans frites with a side salad instead (medium rare) plus two Arnold Palmers for drinks. The food came in a timely manner and the steak was sublime! Finished with blue cheese & herbed butter, there was nothing to complain about whatsoever, tender, flavorful, with good quality beef. As hoped, it was cooked to perfection. There was perfect pink to sear ratio and the frites were crispy, truffled, dreamy. The salad was  fresh with mixed greens and light vinaigrette, a lovely fresh accompaniment. Our server checked in, but didn't crowd us and let us enjoy our meal. Steak brunch on a weekday was a success. This was the best steak frites I've had in jersey city and without a doubt, this is where I'll go when this craving comes at me again. I almost want to have the identical meal today, which is the day after, which means someone had better talk me out of it because I don't have the kind of budget for this, calling.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

After another 20 minutes went by, I called again, only to learn the delivery guy supposedly came, but left the order somewhere (?) without calling or anything. Of course, the kitchen had just closed, so we didn't get to eat dinner.Hypothetically, if I were the manager of The Hamilton Inn, and I knew that someone's food was floating around with an unlikely chance of ever making it to its destination, and I knew that kitchens across the city (including my own) were about to close, I would probably choose from one of the following options: (1) do nothing, or (2) be ready to replace the order before my kitchen closes.

It was an instant sensation from our group.We ordered the truffled French fries to share, we delved in to it while waiting for our main entrée. I selected Huevos Rancheros it consist of two fried eggs, tortillas, black beans, rice, jalapeño, avocado and sour cream. It was delicious and filling for its $12 value.This is truly a neighborhood gem. I genuinely enjoyed the outdoor dining since the streets are fairly quiet.

Then we arrived and we're told that there were reservations so they may not be able to accommodate. Perhaps they should of sent us on our way. But alas, they got a table ready and down Hamilton Inn hill we went. The top of the hill was the French onion soup dumplings. Predictable French onion cheesy goodness but the soup and the doughy dumpling didn't come together quite right with the escargot bowl filled with soup that was left untouched because the spoons were too big to actually get the soup. Lobster roll was decent. Lamb burger was average. Truffle fries got the job done. Steak frites needed tenderizing love and care. Brick chicken fell like bricks all over my insides. The dish was an oily slop of soinachy soup with fingerlings that were so soggy they might as well be mushrooms. The chicken was barely cooked through with remnants of so-called chimmichurri on top.Simply put, certainly no smash hit like it's Broadway namesake.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The fish was pink in the middle and way way too much lettuce. The food was not enjoyable at all. The waitresses never came to check on us and I really could have used a refill on my water to get down the dried chicken.I will not be coming back.

Oh it was quite good full of avocado, black beans, tomato and nice cuts of crispy chicken. Great but missing something, flavor, yeah it was just right but it didn't deliver on the flavor.

This past Sunday evening, we met some cousins who live in Manhattan at The Hamilton Inn. The reviews were good, the location, near the Holland Tunnel, was perfect, and the menu seemed to have something for everyone.My wife and I arrived earlier than the other four family members and we ordered some drinks at the bar. The cocktail list was interesting and reasonably priced. I ordered the Ruby Red Mule and it rocked. (I ordered another one during dinner.) My wife ordered an entire bottle of wine as Sunday is half-price wine night at the Inn - who knew? It was a great surprise and benefit and after one glass, she brought the bottle to the table when the rest of our group arrived; that was a nice savings for some delicious white wine!The vibe at the Hamilton Inn is a bit old world as it's been there a while, but the clientele is generally young and the menu was exciting - a great combination.Our waiter, Mauricio (I think) was ""Johnny-on-the-spot."" He was knowledgeable, caring and had some great suggestions for us.With six of us, womeone is bound to have an issue, whether with the food or with  a request that was overlooked. Here, none of that. Each and every appetizer (the crispy wings with the Asian glaze, oysters) and every entree (chicken parm was fantastic, French Dip tasty, Burger was juicy, Ahi Tuna yummy) was enjoyed, devoured and savored.All in all, a great experience and we wil be back there soon!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It took about 10 minutes to find street parking. Despite this, it's a nice neighborhood to drive around, so that was a plus. It was cool seeing the old brownstones. We decided to sit outside, since the day was nice and not too hot. There were only a couple of people dining inside, so it wasn't crowded and the service was quick. The inside was cool and well-decorated. The bathrooms were clean, as well!Our server was cool and made sure that we had a great experience. We ordered the following items: candied pecan salad, crispy buffalo chicken wings, the potato and goat cheese pierogies. We shared those things and were satisfied at the end of the meal!The candied pecan salad was definitely by far one of the best salads I've had. The fried goat cheese balls were perfection. Not too fried and coated with batter, so you could really enjoy the creamy goat cheese. We had an issue with the first order of wings, because they ended up being drenched in sauce and were cold. However, when we brought that up to our waiter, he offered to bring us another order with the dressing on the side. They were great! They weren't too fried, were meaty, and the fact that we could just dip it into the sauce was great. The pierogies were yummy as well!The prices were good. A little expensive but doable. This is definitely a cool place to come on a date, with friends or family, or just to hang out and have some ""me"" time.

Wow what luck :)there was a wait for a table outside so we waited the twenty minutes out at the bar over a delightful round of cocktails. I had the bacon bloody and he had the bourbon mint tea. His was better!! The Bloody Mary was okay and it definitely didn't skimp on the bacon but it was lacking in flavor. When we were seated I switched to a mango Bellini- it was half the price and a much more delicious drink! We ordered the truffle egg pizza and the lobster roll with sweet potato fries instead of regular fries and a side of bacon. Bacon was not crispy enough.. Shame on you guys!! You should know better !! The truffle pizza was okay. The lobster roll was plentiful with lobster but really missing a kick or additional flavor. Overall, a 3 star good experience and a 4.5 drink and service experience.

174,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"The Hamilton Inn just gets me.Its upscale, bar-and-grill, corner-property persona is charming. Their surprisingly good Chilaquiles and addictive Sticky Wings are reliable picks. And when I was last here at a table of 12*, the well-trained staff was most attentive despite a busy brunch crowd.But what speaks to me most? No joke, it's the $4 mimosas. Four dollar mimosas!Could I drink my weight in brunch cocktails at some other restaurant's ""bottomless"" offering? Sure. But it's been a while since I let myself do that because that tends to result in me binge drinking and me binge drinking leads to bad decisions on a Sunday where I want to keep the party going and bad decisions on a Sunday where I want to keep the party going leads to really rough Mondays where I hate myself and quite possibly the rest of the work week where all I'm trying to do is survive till Friday so I can not go out and pass facedown on my couch. And I just can't do it anymore, kids, so $4 mimosas at my own speed it is. To me, four bucks is a steal, which comes with a sense of security for my wallet, liver, and lack of any and all willpower. Everybody wins.Now, brunch food - I mentioned the Chilaquiles. Despite The Hamilton Inn's founding father moniker, they do offer quite a bit of Mexican-leaning items. And their aforementioned crispy tortilla dish is one of the best I've had outside of a proper Mexican restaurant. Spicy red chorizo meat blends with the scrambled eggs, queso fresco, and salsa to create this really nice, bright, and bold base. For more lunch-y fare, splitting an order of their Sticky Wings (technically a special, so ask if you don't see it on the menu) with the squad is probably a good move. Employing more outside-America influences here, they're Asian-inspired, substantial in size, and as advertised, deliciously sticky.Have I ordered other dishes here and not been as satisfied? Do I enjoy asking myself questions? Yes and yes. Chilaquiles, wings, and (a respectable number of) mimosas seem to do me just fine, so that's my recommendation and I'm sticking to it.*The largest they can accommodate, and frankly, a bit of tight squeeze at the front windows.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We made reservations via open table and had no problem booking a week in advanced. Boom, moving forward. So upon arrival,  we were given the option of which table we wanted to sit at since a few were open at the time we went for dinner. We ended up smack in the middle at a round table since the only other options were the booths by the windows, which the host said might be a little drafty for cold ass winter we've been having.Waters were immediately served, drink orders were shortly taken, food and drinks were served well within minutes. The food overall I thought was very good. The $1 East Coast Oysters were a steal and truly pretty good for nightly special. I had also ordered the INN BURGER as an entree and BANANA CREAM PIE for dessert. The banana cream pie wasn't all that. The only other option on their dessert menu was Flourless Chocolate Cake, which in past experiences didn't sit well with me. My friends had ordered it and to my surprise, it was pretty darn good!!  A little nutty. Hazelnut nutty if my palate serves me correct. The banana cream was more banana pudding of out prepackage powder box type mix. As for my burger, I thought It was overall tasty, except I wish I had more meat in it. We're talking like a 2oz-3oz difference from 8oz. Any smaller and it would have been a kid size burger! Overall I would say the specials are what makes this place. $1 Oysters and half off cocktails made my night.

Not raving about the oyster special as some of them were really small or didn't look fresh. The dumplings were good though - cover anything in a blanket of cheese and it'll be amazing. We then split the Truffled Egg Pizza and the Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Steak. I wasn't too impressed at this point. It would have been better had the eggs been more over easy but the yolks were hard and had a stronger essence of the truffle. The salad was overly dressed for my taste  and he waitress didn't ask how we wanted the steak cooked, so the whole salad was a moot point. The service was attentive and the ambiance is fun.

You come up with a gimmick or some enticing deal to bring business into your slow brackets- then you give it half effort because the deal is not profitable I guess. $1 oysters sounds great, and admittedly the only time we've visited Hamilton inn was for this deal. That being said- I always order something else and we usually drink, so it's not as though we are coming and dropping $12 and leaving. Today we stopped in around 4pm as usual. The bartender seated us and brought over waters. We then waited for 5+ minutes in an empty restaurant, until the bartender once again came over and took our orders. I don't think he was supposed to be serving us, but clearly the server was nowhere to be found. Husband ordered a dozen oysters, I ordered the corned beef sandwich. I didn't even particularly want anything on the menu, but he wanted oysters so alas. The food comes out, and the oysters are completely dry (how is that possible?) they're kind of stuck to the shells, and they're all room temperature. The ice in the tray was clearly just for show. We didn't risk eating them, took the sandwich to go, paid the tab and left. So despite not even being able to sit there and have our lunch, I still dropped like $30 only to have to go find another place to eat. Side note: the corned beef on the sandwich was great when I reheated it, but I would have enjoyed it much more if we didn't have to go on a hunt for proper oysters.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I hadn't been back in probably a year but I remember the food and service were great, so I expected the same. Unfortunately, maybe it was an off-night, but our server did not seem interested in providing good service. He approached our table and didn't smile nor did he seem happy to be there (it was a relatively short gentleman with a beard). My elderly mother, being picky, had asked for cole slaw as a side instead of french fries, and our server would not accommodate her request. I couldn't understand why, since we noticed that the cole slaw is served on the side with another sandwich, and my mother ordered the Inn Burger. In addition, the food was mostly just not good. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and they arrived cold, the cheese looked like it had been sitting out for awhile before being brought to our table as it was not melty as expected, but rather, by the time it arrived at the table the cheese had congealed into a rubbery mess on the nachos. It was honestly really gross.Also, I specifically asked the server to please make sure her burger was well-done (I know, I know, it's an abomination to cook a piece of meat like that), as my mother is really squeamish about her meat being even the slightest bit pink. She took a bite of the burger and it was already pink close to the edge. She couldn't finish it. She didn't send it back because our server was not friendly, we felt so uncomfortable about the prospect of sending our food back.My sister's chicken parm came with the option of fries or a salad. She opted for the fries, assuming they would be on the side (the menu does not say otherwise). Instead, they served the chicken and the sauce on top of the fries, rendering the fries completely inedible as they were soggy from sitting in the sauce for so long. Again, gross. The one highlight is that my seafood stew was pretty tasty. It was a cold night so it was a welcome dish. I'd say The Hamilton Inn is not what it used to be. I'm not sure if it's under new management, or they've hired less experienced staff, but the entire experience left so much to be desired. I don't think I'll be back as there are so many other great restaurants in town that care about the quality of the food, offer good service and don't turn their noses at people who ask for simple substitutions.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Brunch has $4 mimomas, screwdrivers, greyhounds and bloody Mary's. All the juice is fresh squeezed. We started with the truffled egg pizza. It is $14. Worth. It. It is a crispy flatbread with the best flavors! The truffle oil gives it the perfect touch. Another appetizer we tried was the French onion soup dumplings. They are $12. They were yummy but not anything new. The dumpling was a nice touch and it is a good size portion. Comes with 6 dumplings. I personally ordered the fish tacos for my brunch entree. $12. The fish was cooked perfectly but the slaw was not the best. Very plain. The filet Benedict was a better entree choice. $19.

My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and the Truffled Egg Pizza.  The Egg Pizza had just the right amount of salt, and crisp.  It was an explosion of textures and flavors.  The Bloody Mary had a cocktail sauce taste.  In all fairness, I do not like them so I do not know how they fare against others.  My friend liked it and ordered a second one; she said they had a nice kick.  I hear the Bacon Bloody Mary is to die for.They added a Filet (Mignon) Benedict to their menu.  I really wanted this with lobster.  Though it was not on the menu, they added lobster for a mere $5.  One of the owners, John, even came out and thanked me for the idea.  When I asked what idea, he said the Surf 'n Turf Benedict.  It was delicious.  The filet was cooked perfectly, tender, and juicy.  There were large chunks of lobster, firm and tender at the same time.  They did not skimp on the lobster.  I would look for this new menu item or ask for it.  I also had the World's Best Brunch Cocktail (WBBC).  This was a Mimosa with St. Germain added.  The St. Germain added a sweet twist to it, so much better than a plain Mimosa.  We were too full for dessert, but we'll definitely be returning to the Hamilton Inn.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
209,lsA4JwS7KN_JTMQucNx6Kw,Ann Marie E.,1.0 star rating,"We went to the Hamilton Inn yesterday evening. The drink menu was extensive and the food menu is sandwich/burger-type fare. I had the French Dip and would highly recommend it. While the food was very good, this place gets 1 star because of the inside temperature and also because of the service. Yesterday's temperature was approximately 95 degrees outside with a heat index closer to 104 degrees accompanied by typical insane NJ humidity. And the restaurant was not much cooler inside. The temperature outside the restaurant was actually cooler than inside. The air inside was still and there was not a single fan on to try to combat the heat.  I made a reservation online and called while en route to ask about where their parking was located. At no time did anyone mention that their A/C was broken--a fact that I think is imperative to tell customers before they walk in. We actually only went to the Hamilton Inn because the restaurant we wanted to go to was actually closed due to issues with its air conditioning--you'd think the Hamilton Inn would have done the same! I was appalled there were other customers in the restaurant as it was so unbearably hot. We were also sorely disappointed with the waitstaff. We had to ask someone to take our order. There was also one point in the meal when I looked up because I was in need of something and the entire dining room was completely unattended. All of the waitstaff were gathered in the back. This, compounded with the sauna-like temperature, made for a very uncomfortable meal. I'd consider going back in the winter months--maybe.

This review is solely based on my experience during brunch today. My BF wasn't drinking and only had water. We waited until he finished his and my water and both of our meals to get another glass of water! It was actually mind boggling that no one came to fill it up and when our plates were cleared, our waitress finally stopped by for more than a flash second and he finally had the chance to ask for water and both of our glasses (after more than a half hour) were filled and the bottle was left on our table because the waitress probably figured out how annoyed my BF was with trying to get some darn water. It was clearly busy but seriously? I had avocado toast which I have also had from a few different places in JC (short grain, warehouse etc) and the toast from Hamilton Inn was bland and boring. It's literally an English muffin with avocado and a poached egg on it. It also had pickled onions but the onions I had were more raw than pickled. There's nothing else on this and it lacks flavor. Certainly not worth getting as a brunch item. I also got my usual truffle fries which I love. My BF got the steak eggs Benedict which he thought was only good because of the hollandaise sauce.  He was pretty disappointed with the steak.Will I be back? Yes. I seriously love Hamilton Inn. We had our first date here and it's literally a staple in my life. I enjoy the atmosphere, the drinks, most of the food and like to support local businesses.

The Brioche French toast was good but for $14 I would have expected alittle bit of a bigger portion. The Inn burger was cooked Medium just as I requested but lacked taste other than the char from the grill. The truffle fries were pretty good. My daughter just wanted scrambled eggs and bacon and my other daughter wanted toast with jelly ( but they didn't have any jelly or jam) only honey and only got one piece of toast cut in half. The scrambled eggs were just plopped on the plate with no special presentation. Menu u wise for brunch the definitely aren't kid friendly. When u say brunch u would think they would offer a few breakfast items for kids. Instead it was grilled cheese, chicken fingers, and pasta .

Service is hit or miss, usually miss. Food is very uneven. The French Onion Soup dumplings are amazing with melted cheese on top. It's a creative dish and well executed. The sandwiches are standard but not worth the $10-15 price. Oysters are good, especially for $1 on Wednesday nights.Decent mixed drinks but the sangria is really watered down.

Ha!We also were able to bring in a small cake for the birthday celebration.  Initially, on the phone we were told that they would charge us a few dollars to cut the cake but we never ended up getting charged for it.  Maybe because it was so tiny!  But, I liked the fact that they were OK with letting us bring it in! Lastly, I dig the ambiance a lot.  It's very simple but elegant and laid back at the same time.  Almost a rustic vibe too!  (Outdoor seating is still happening as well!)",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Case and point with the Nachos Oaxaca we ordered (with grass fed steak), The cheese had stilled and wasn't ooey-gooey cheesy anymore.  Chips were also soggy.  I ordered the Special Omelet of the day (something with asparagus, lobster and Cheddar Cheese).  It was all right, but very small in portion and that itty bit cost me $17.  Some home fries and cold toast were served alongside.  The novio got Huevos Rancheros, which barely deserve a 1/5 star because it was so bland.

242,lkKKGOijmKkg3Tj4YkmA3g,N. O.,3.0 star rating,"As a resident of the Hamilton Park neighborhood who lives a block away from The Hamilton Inn, I frequent this lovely restaurant often. It consistently offers quality food in a convivial atmosphere, and until today has never let me down. As others have indicated, Wednesdays at the Hamilton Inn is $1 oysters night. My friend and I decided to partake. This specific night happened to also be restaurant week, and they were offering an ala carte menu, which while seemingly tasty, we passed on to select our favorites from the daily menu.The food: The ahi tuna burger, which is by far normally the best ahi tuna burger this side of the Hudson, was off tonight. I don't know if it was the cut, but the tuna was chewier than normal. In addition, the slaw topping was runnier than usual. The accompanying side salad didn't taste as fresh as it usually does. My friend had a turkey burger and truffle friends (they make the best truffle fries) which he enjoyed. The service: This area of our dining experience is where I was the most disappointed. The Hamilton Inn staff are friendly, prompt and accomodating. Indeed, our host was so helpful in getting us sat right away despite the fact that it was jammed at 7pm on a Wednesday - a likely result of it being restaurant week. Our waitress seemed pleasant, but she was disengaged. She never checked in on us after the food runner brought us our meal. In fact, we only saw her when she took our order, and when she processed our bill. Furthermore, our second order of drinks - water and beer - took longer than reasonable (over 10 minutes). Also, a busboy that was clearing an adjacent table of an oyster plate spelled jostled the plate and inadvertently spilled oyster ice water onto my friend. He didn't acknowledge that he did. Not a huge deal, but it's something you don't expect from the Hamilton Inn.

Our waiter was fine, nothing notable to mention about the service. The problem here is the food. We started with a half dozen oysters which were very dirty and a lot of the dirt had made its way into the oysters liquor and who wants that? Also, when serving oysters, you want to use crushed ice, it allows them to nestle into the ice and ensure none of the liquor is spilled and you can easily apply condiments, not the case here. If you eat them enough, you'll know this isn't a small addition.We also had the french onion soup dumplings which were tasty, but mostly because of the gruyere, the execution was off, nothing like the quality at Stanton Social. They pretty much fell apart upon removal from the dish.For entrees, we had the ribs which were not quite ""fall off the bone"" as the waiter promised, but a little dry and worse, the sauce was a thin and tart. I had the steak frites which was not cooked to my requested medium and lacked salt and pepper. Hanger steak can be a little tough at times, better places would have served it cut on a bias (less of an issue, but preferred). The maitre ' d butter added nothing to the dish as it lacked the flavor needed to make the addition worth the calories.I'll close by saying the sandwiches which we did not have, looked very good, if I tried this place again, I'd go that route. I get the impression that if you live in the area this could be a great spot for a beer and a good lunch/casual dinner, but the entrees seem like a weak point.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The shredded romaine lettuce was yellowing and dried out.  The Grilled Chicken breast that I had added on top was bland and tasteless, as if it was out of some large frozen bag.  I munched on some of the chicken and feta, but mainly focused on the cucumbers and olives - a pitiful lunch.  The aforementioned French Toast was oddly concocted with really thin slices of what may have been a squashed croissant, but was sweet and whimsical nonetheless.I also grabbed some forkfuls of the cheesy grits, which were remarkably creamy and similar to a decadent mac n' cheese.  A bite of the bland guacamole was worthy of a cringe, though.  The French Fries were tasty, but definitely could have used more salt and less oil.In regards to the service, I give the restaurant props for accommodating our ever-changing party size and reservation time, but our waitress had the personality of a rock.  Oh, and how could I forget to mention that there was a hair on my side plate and my glass of water lovingly included a floating bug.  Lastly, when I turned in this gross water glass, I did not receive a replacement throughout the entire meal.Overall, my brunch at The Hamilton Inn was marginal at best.  However, the casual décor, brunch cocktail specials, and vast menu would potentially draw me back, especially if I were accompanying someone with a child.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

My first time was a late night midweek at the bar. Place was dead. Beer was fine and ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It was a bit bland and tasted more firey burned than juicy chicken. Bartender didn't say much but was nice. Second time was during peak brunch time on a Saturday. It was packed, there was a wait, but the host was cool to get us seated as soon as possible. I thought the brunch tasted great, but the presentation was very mediocre. I had the burrito, looked like it came from an office cafeteria, but it tasted good. Last time was for dinner, ordered the chicken parm, came out super fast in maybe less than five minutes, I was shocked! I guess the microwave was on full blast. Tasted like diner food,  which was disappointing for $19 and didn't even come with any salad or anything else, just the chicken and pasta. Also, my glass of Malbec was warmer than room temperature like the bottle was sitting by the heater. I would go back maybe for happy hour and brunch and maybe try something different on the menu, but dinner is overpriced and presentation is not impressive.  The host is cool, he seems to always be there, and I've gotten more attention from him than the servers or bartender. Also, the atmosphere has an early 1900s Americana bar feel to it. I liked that.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I'm sorry, but your mimosas aren't great, your menu is incredibly limited, so there's no reason to have a stick up your ass.

The mimosas and bellinis were good and the coffee was above average.This seems to be a popular spot for brunch and gets plenty busy,so its a good idea to reserve  a table if you are coming as a group.I love the area that it is in.That plus the way its interior is decorated gives it an air of extra coziness and a laidback homey feel.The server we had was attentive and nice.Definitely coming back here for more.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Appetizers: lobster bisque, fried calamariEntrees: free range chicken, pan roasted red snapperDesserts: flourless chocolate cake, banana cream pie There was an issue with my chicken order not being placed properly so we ended up having to wait ~20 minutes extra for my entree to come out. My bf being the gentleman that he is waited to eat his snapper fish, although they brought that out early. The waiter felt really bad and apologized multiple times and provided a free cappuccino and bread + butter for me. When the chicken entree did arrive though, it was totally worth the wait and absolutely delicious! I didn't try my bf's snapper but he wasn't a huge fan - he said my chicken entree was better. The lobster bisque and calamari were yummy too. And the flourless chocolate cake was so amazingggg - so warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I thought the banana cream pie was just OK but my bf liked it a lot. Even though our waiter messed up my order, he definitely made up for it by apologizing - so we would say the service is great. The ambiance is nice. There's seating separate from the bar for a nice brunch/lunch/dinner but there's also a large bar to sit at as well with TV's mounted at the bar. The place isn't huge but it's got a good vibe going on. We came during a week of a huge snow storm around 6PM and when we left around 7:30ish there was actually a lot of people at the bar for dinner - but it wasn't crazy shoulder to shoulder crowded - just enough of a crowd to make it feel like people were actually venturing out of their apartments during the freezing cold! I would come back to sit outside when the weather is nicer and order from the regular menu. I also wouldn't come here regularly as it's way too expensive!

However, I must update because my latest visit made me think twice and otherwise. The food was lacking standards of the first few times, and I was left feeling disappointed. For those who frequent this restaurant will notice that they have adjusted their menu as well, for better and worse.I've only been here for weekend brunch, and it seems they have expanded their brunch menu to include more entree options which is great. However, with the addition of new menu items, they've also increased the prices. Their delicious Steak & Eggs brunch went up at least 20% in price (was $17, but now $20). My beloved favorite Eggs Florentine has lost the smoked salmon topping so now it's just spinach (and there's no option to add smoked salmon). I was a bit disappointed to see some of these adjustments made, but I assume that The Hamilton Inn has garnered that much popularity that they saw fit to increase prices and adjust some of their dishes based on demand. Nonetheless, they still kept to the $4 cocktail specials for brunch, which I'm very glad for. On my last visit on a Saturday afternoon, I went with my usual poached eggs for brunch -- the Eggs Benedict with Ham topping and a side of home fries. It was a dish that never failed. This time, it failed. One egg was nice and yolky, and the other was looking ugly, running with water and completely boiled through. The overall dish temperature wise was very lukewarm -- ham was like a cold cut, home fries were rubbery, and the english muffin was burnt on the edges. The Bloody Mary I ordered had a wilted celery and the lemon garnish still had seeds in it. For me, it's all about the details, especially if a restaurant has built a certain reputation in my mind. I am beginning to feel that eggs benedicts have failed me more times than not though, and perhaps I should not test my luck by ordering them every time. Despite the less than awesome experience at The Hamilton Inn, I certainly still support them and plan to go there for weekend brunch, but they have to get their act on track.

While I don't think 3 stars is necessarily such a bad thing, I thought it was a good sign of customer service to be so concerned. We decided to return on $1 east coast oyster night. This is a phenomenal and apparently very popular deal. The place was packed with people eating probably more oysters than they would have if they were normal price. (Our order was delayed due to an order of 112 oysters... really?) My theory on $1 oysters is they're cleaning out the last weekend's stock before this weeks comes in. However, there was nary a putrid bivalve in the bunch- they were perfectly clean with a hint of the sea. The other dishes we ordered were the nachos and the kale Caesar. The nachos were a bit better than last time- not as greasy. The kale Caesar was great but I'm a sucker for anything including raw kale. I'm going to up it to 4 stars, cautiously. It was exceptionally hot in there, possibly because of the crowd and the fact it was the hottest night of the year. We also had a few awkward moments of wait time- to be greeted, seated, served drinks at the bar, and served our first courses.

I usually love pumpkin ravioli when it comes in a butter sage sauce. I received 5 ravioli in a sauce as dark as gravy. The entire dish tasted similar to a pumpkin spice latte minus the coffee; overly sweet and overly spiced. It was overpowering and unappetizing. I only ate two of the 5 that were on my plate. $20The paparadelli pasta dish with fried egg and pancetta was also overly salty and instead of a sauce, came in a bowl with enough water that you could have considered it broth $21So the entire meal came to $80 with the 2 small appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 beers.

I'm a big fan of the truffled egg flatbread and fish tacos, both are great -- as are the daily drink or happy hour specials. My girlfriend and I keep meaning to get there for half priced cocktails and $1 oysters.My meager 3-star review, however, has a lot to do with the quantity-to-price ratio I've increasingly noticed on some of our delivery orders. The asparagus side, for example, is $9 and most recently (late August) we only received 7 stalks of asparagus. I'm sorry but a vegetable side should not cost over $1 per piece of vegetable.I decided to  chalk this up to a one-time mistake, but last night we ordered, among other things, the goat cheese pierogis. This is a dish I haven't ordered from them in a while, but always enjoyed both the quality and number of pierogis received. Yesterday, we received 3 whole pieces for $9.

333,cm8uQnyZi-KZkSbWMViYwQ,Marisa D.,5.0 star rating,"Its fitting that Hamilton Inn is my first yelp review as it is one of the first restaurants that helped to establish Jersey City as a ""Foodie"" destination. My husband and I  have been going since it opened and we can honestly say we have eaten there over 100 times with friends and family. We have tried everything thing on their menu but find ourselves gravitating to the same dishes over and over. For our standard Friday meal I order the Candied Pecan Salad with chicken and my husband orders the Ahi Tuna Burger (if he is feeling uber healthy) or the French Dip (when it has been a tough week). Its rare to find a salad that leaves you both satisfied and feeling healthy and this salad does both. The dressing is super light and fresh so no guilt in ordering extra and the goat cheese is presented as 3 crispy balls served warm. The Ahi Tuna Burger is a great value and it always cooked to perfection. The side here is a rich salad with varied greens but can easily be subbed for sweet potato fries. When we bring friends or family and indulge in the appetizers again here we have our go-tos. The Asian BBQ crispy wings are a true fan favorite. Unique in its savory and sweet flavorings and I am not sure how they are so crispy but its Amazing. The serving is enough for 4 adults to share no problem.  The Truffle Egg Pizza is served as a long flat bread and is a great way to start a brunch.John, the owner, is always there on the weekends ready to welcome familiar and new faces alike always ready to make the dinning experience the most pleasant and relaxing.

I used to think it was dumb to write off a place after one bad experience. I've come here many dozens of times over the years, from when it was the Hamilton Ale House in the 90's. I even gave a good Yelp review previously. After my TGIF visit July 24th, I get that I walked in and sat at the bar at the wrong day and time. No eye contact; little attention; irritation when I asked a question about the beers on tap; eagerness to return to side conversations behind the bar, and to check inventory. For such a good menu, why give a paying customer the total ""food-court shuffle"" when you have questions? Fortunately for me, I had the bartender repeat what I ordered; it was different than what I gave. Instead of an apology, I got an annoyed look.I planned to spend 60-90 minutes but the lackadaisical, inattentive service greatly increased the time spent. The bar was 3/4th full when I got there. It was empty after I left, late afternoon. I guess everyone got the message: your money's welcome here, not you.At these prices, shouldn't a minimum level of friendliness, professionalism, or at least a sense of welcoming, apply?

It is obvious that the place is kept up well and the bar looks like a nice place to hang out for a few drinks. Fully stocked and had lots of NJ beers on tap. Overall the restaurant is really just a normal neighborhood restaurant. I'd say mostly locals go there or maybe people who want to wait out tunnel traffic who do not eat fast food. We got our menus and started looking at what they had. The menu is setup a little awkward. The sandwiches were reasonably priced and looked good, but I did not want a sandwich. The other options sounded OK, but cost $25ish/entree. I do not mind paying that, but they're charging WAY higher than they should in my opinion. I decided on the fish tacos and it was pretty good. Nothing special, but I was happy with it. It was a busy night so it took about 20 minutes to get our check from the waitress - it happens I suppose. Also when we were finishing our drinks they made us move to another table. I guess they needed to combine our table with another one to fit a larger party. I felt a little disappointed at that. They never informed the waiter for the table that they moved us to either. So the whole experience can be summarized with ""ehh"".  Hence the reason for the 3 stars.

The only cons are that you are too close to your surrounding tables and it is very busy and noisy.

BUT...I have a gluten sensitivity, and I ordered a burger with no bun. When they brought it out, it had a bun and I said ""OH it was supposed to be with no bun,  I have a gluten intolerance."" The wait person who brought it out originally had said, no problem and took it back. Returned only moments later with the bun-less burger. That basically shows me that in the timing they were gone, there is no way they could have re-cooked the burger they simply removed the bun, re-applied fresh toppings and brought ti back out. For me, because I only have a sensitivity, not full blown celiac  disease, I said nothing and just ate it. But if you do have celiac, then you can't have anything that even has a spec of gluten on it... so this would be a major problem. That said, the drinks were good, our waitress was attentive, we went there for the $1 oysters on Wednesdays and they were delicious, so the overall meal was great, and all is well that ends well I suppose.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The first time we went for dinner on a weekend and I had the lamb burger, which was tasty but not something I'm pining to go back for. Honestly, there wasn't anything very memorable about dinner. Just standard fare American food.Then we came twice for happy hour because I'm always lured in by the dollar oysters on Wednesdays. Unfortunately, both times, the oysters were quite gritty and the oyster sizes are very inconsistent (some being tiny!). However, the drinks are strong and cocktails are half price on Wednesdays as well. I don't think I'll be coming back for the oysters though. We also went once for brunch. I got the omelette of the day which I would not recommend. It was rather lackluster and the heirloom tomatoes turned out to be just regular cherry tomatoes. But my friends raved about their dishes, which included the french toast, chillaquilies, and huevos rancheros. I would come back again for brunch but try their other dishes instead.We made reservations three out of the four times, which I would recommend.

I like to refer to them as ""breakfast nachos"" with my friends. The chorizo is split down the middle, and charred until crispy.

My wife and I ate here last Saturday night, though it was far from busy at 7pm. They had ample seating outside and it was a great night so we opted to sit outside. They sat us down at a 2 seater that was directly next to the kitchen, and had a horribly wobbly table thanks to some uneven concrete beneath. My wife asked if we could sit at another table a few feet away, but was told ""that's a 4 seater"" despite the fact that it was just 2 tables pushed together. I completely understand needing to keep some table inventory for larger groups on a Saturday night, but literally 2 minutes later another couple came by and they split the table up anyway...leading to quite a bit of frustration and a mediocre first impression. So we sat at a wobbly table able to hear every plate and cup clink as they were bused. I had higher hopes for the food, as they had a Lobster Roll on the menu, but was somewhat disappointed when it arrived. It was rather small, and came on a $0.25 bun that looked like it had just been purchased at Stop 'N Shop. I also found out 5 bites in that the bottom was charred a bit from the grill. I've had many lobster rolls in the NJ, NY/Brooklyn area and this unfortunately sat at the bottom of them all.My wife had a good Chicken Sandwich, and the wine, beer, and Pierogi appetizer were very good, along with the general atmosphere, which was kid and dog friendly (of which we have both so understand that's hard to come by).So overall not an amazing experience for our first time, but not bad either.

At this point, I've eaten here a handful of times and enjoyed each visit. I think it's one of Jersey City's hidden gems, located in the quaint neighborhood surrounding Hamilton Park. It's not a very large restaurant but I love the cozy, casual and intimate atmosphere. My food favorites: The potato and goat cheese pierogies. Why are there only 3?! I could probably eat 10. No sharing. They're topped with caramelized onion and not regular, but TRUFFLED, sour cream. Truffle oil seems to be a nice addition to several things on the menu. They have this spicy dipping sauce (I think it's sriracha based?) that is excellent. I load it on the East LA fish tacos and just about everything else. MM. Other cool things about the menu: Wagyu burgers (US version of Kobe beef, really juicy and yummy), super tasty veggie burgers, housemade sauces, ravioli and risotto specials... honestly, everything Ive had here is good. Bonuses: Tuesday Trivia along with half priced pitchers, but if you're into fancy-ish cocktails like I am, you have to go Wednesdays for half priced cocktails. Normally, they're about 10-12 bucks a pop, which is fine considering how much alcohol they contain. Try La Dolce Vita. It has Titos handmade vodka, prosecco, st germain and peach nectar.

This place would be great!But alas, I have to actually taste things when I go to restaurants.Crab cake: Mushy on the inside, slightly less mushy on the outside. Just enough crab in it to qualify it as crab cake. Decent presentation, with sprouts and drizzled sriracha-mayo sauce. The flavor is what I expect of a crab cake that you buy frozen in a store-bought package. Maybe a little bit less. Crème brulée french toast: I don't understand the reference to crème brulée. Where is the crème, and where is the brulée? Ohhh I get it. The former must refer to the eggs in the batter they make the toaste with, and the brulée must refer to the fact that you have to actually ""toast"" french toast. But I could find no difference between this, and any other cafeteria food service french toast. The bread was kind of soggy. I guess they didn't brulée it enough. Barbequed eggs: Two english muffin halves. Pulled pork layered on next. Then, a poached egg to top them off. A side of breakfast potatoes. The pulled pork reminded me of when you microwave some Costco pulled pork, leave it on the counter for an afternoon, and reheat it again several hours later. The taste and moisture were zapped out of  the meat, leaving behind a stringy, vaguely pulled-pork-esque substance. The egg was poached perfectly, though. Ok, there's little reason to mention the lifeless peppers and potatoes, at this point. The dish as a whole was arranged beautifully and really photogenic. But again, my mouth is doing most of the judging here.  You can sense some recurring themes here. Three words that describe what was common to most of the items we had here: Soggy, pre-made, but pretty. The place was cute, and the server was very nice.

Like I said this might only pertain to the rather boring brunch menu that I see at restaurants all over the place.  Based on the soup dumplings I will give them another chance for lunch or dinner.Also I mentioned the French fries issue to the manager as we were leaving and also told him that it happened to the guy sitting next to us.  He merely responded that it's a menu typo...",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Very cape cod-esque, lots of wood, lots of candlelight. Chalkboards, etc. The cocktails were awesome. We had 3rd trophy wife, cucumber and berries, and a dolce vita. All were amazing.Ordered 10 oysters, and cape may salts are new to me. They are a bit smaller, mildly briny, and would have liked them slightly more chilled, but they got the job done.

Burger was good, expected more of a Minetta Tavern-esque burger, but the patty was surprisingly lean and beef tasting.

I heard about their brunch specials and decided to catch up with some girlfriend's over brunch. But this was on a Friday morning and brunch is only on Saturday & Sunday. No worries though, because the regular menu is great still! I ordered crab cakes and sweet potato fries. The crab cakes came two on a plate and are seasoned to perfection, it's taste kind of like some Caribbean spices, and it's drizzled with an orange sauce that has a zesty flavor. The sweet potato fries are the BEST I've ever had (and I had a best before I'd tried these-- I've switched teams). My friends had the roasted pecan salad (I think that's what it was called) it had fried pieces of ricotta cheese in it (yum), classic buffalo wings and one more thing I can't remember. Everyone's food was great. Also the red sangria's pretty good too.     The next couple of times I've visited I've had the fried calamari which is so good! Chicken fingers w/ the little one (good too)-- they fry with panko. And on one occasion I just came in for drinks with a friend. From 1-4pm they have liquid lunch with half priced wine and sangria. We were loving that of course. Our bar tender that day was Kevin (our fav redhead) he was so much fun and really nice. All of the wait staff is pleasant. But Kevin's our favorite.

As long as the stools have backs, I have zero problem with sitting at the bar. In fact, often it's a better experience since I get to chit-chat with the bartender a bit. He described some of the house cocktails and gave me a taste of Pimms. We stuck to the $3 brunch cocktails, but I'll definitely try the fancier ones on a future visit. A lunch menu is available as well as brunch on the weekends, which is a big plus to me since I am one of a rare breed who is not that fond of eggs, french toast or pancakes. Jeff and I split the lobster roll, 4 Kumomoto oysters, a side of mac & cheese, and the shrimp po' boy sliders. This wound up being way too much food. The sliders were the least interesting. I added some Tobasco to the one I ate in an attempt to give it some flavor. The lobster roll, on the other hand, was really good. It had avocado and sliced cherry tomatoes and the roll was soft and perfectly toasted and of better quality than your basic hotdog bun.  There are 5 taps. Nothing too exciting (Stella, Blue Moon, blah blah), but also Abita Purple Haze. There are about 20 bottle options including the usual crap, but also including a few I'd happily toss back: Maudite, Leffe, Rogue Dead Guy, Duvel. Okay, those are the only ones out of the whole list I'd drink. But the point is that if we went there for dinner once a month, there would be at least one beer I'd be happy to have with my meal.

The best thing about this place is the outdoor seating which our other favorite restaurants rarely have. The beers on tap have always been delicious.

For dinner, The Truffled Egg Pizza was delicious if a little expensive. The runny egg and the pizza melded deliciously. The craft beer of the week paired very nicely. For brunch, the creme brulee french toast was amateur (flattened croissants with maple syrup) and the waitress couldn't tell me why it deserved the name creme brulee. My friend's croissant with bacon, egg, and cheese was good and the bacon crisper than most. However, I get the same thing at the deli near work for 1/3 of the price.

473,yOrOJHRqqdTmPFESXyR5-A,Tom F.,4.0 star rating,"My girlfriend and I have had our eye on Hamilton Inn since we moved to Jersey City last fall, and our first visit did not disappoint.  The menu of Brunch specific items is small, but high quality, just enough breakfast type options to balance with their full menu of lunch entrees, salads, and sides.  You can't beat the brunch drink offerings - $3 for a bloody mary, screwdriver, or greyhound.  I decided to upgrade to the Bacon Bloody Mary - since everything IS better with bacon, after all.  It was good, but for $7, you are just paying an extra $4 for a slice of bacon in your bloody mary - the flavor doesn't infuse into the drink enough, so next time I will just go for the regular $3 bloody mary.For our entrees, I got the creme brulee french toast and ordered a side of home fries to balance out the sweetness.  The french toast was soft and not overly sweet, with strong hints of pure vanilla that pairs well with the strawberry compote that's served on the side.  The portion size is not overwhelming, but with the side of potatoes, it was plenty - and I have a big appetite.  My girlfriend got the traditional eggs benedict, served over english muffins with a slice of ham on each.  She enjoyed the fact that the hollandaise sauce was served in nice proportion - covered the egg, but not drowning the whole plate.  The eggs were cooked nicely, with the yolk runny enough to make a nice additional ""gravy"" for the plate.We are both looking forward to returning for another brunch, or for dinner, or even just for drinks.  Their bar is big and comfortable, with hooks for coats or bags (which not enough bars offer).  And they offer a small number of quality craft beers on tap plus a few more craft beers in bottles for those of us with a more adventurous taste in beer.  Plus the spirits and mixed drink menu is excellent, so it would be great to stop in just for a drink any night.  Can't wait for our next visit!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Luckily, I remembered about The Hamilton inn, we've had brunch here once before in Sept and everything was good but this time it was great. They more than made up for beginning of the day. There was a pretty long wait for a table but every now and then the host made sure to keep us informed that he was doing everything he could to get us seated and that was all I needed to hear to know that this was going to be a much better choice than the first place. Acknowledging your customers is the key to keeping them happy! The wait ended up being longer than they served brunch until but they kept the kitchen open for us to order from that menu which we all definitely appreciated. And naturally since it was late and they were so busy they were out of a couple of things but they sent out a complimentary app and even desserts at the end of the meal. Our server Carlos was great, very attentive and helpful. All in all, I have to say they really blew me away today.

When we sat down, we took forever looking over the menu because everything looked so good we just couldn't decide...but while we perused the options, I ordered a screwdriver and he ordered a maple old fashioned. God I love brunch. Anyway, we ended up splitting the truffle egg pizza, upon the waitress's recommendation, and I had the omelette of the day - fresh mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and basil - and my boyfriend had the chilaquiles. The truffle egg pizza, which sounds really weird, was fantastic!! I love everything truffle, so maybe I'm biased...but it was so good! Two sunny side up eggs served atop pizza, so you get that runny egg yolk with the crispy crust and hot melty cheese? Mmmmm....My omelette was also amazing, and how could I forget the side of bacon I ordered! At first I was like, $4 for a side of bacon?? But then I found out they basically give you half a pound of bacon, totally worth it! AND it was super delicious bacon. All bacon is delicious, but somehow this was EXTRA delicious! Boyfriend's chilaquiles were awesome as well. I ended up having two more screwdrivers because you can't really beat the price ($4 at brunch, woo!), and we left the place drunk, full, and happy.The only issue I had was that we'd specifically called right before we went there to ask if they had seating available right then, and they said yes, but when we got there (like a mere 5 minutes later), all the seating was taken and we were told we would have to  wait or we could sit at the bar. We ended up sitting at the bar, which was fine, but I was just slightly peeved that they said seating was available and it wasn't. I mean, yes we could've probably made a reservation for a table in the next 5 minutes, and they can't help when people come in, but, you know. Particulars.

I politely informed the waitress and she took it away. I was brought back the same burger with the same raw spots. When I complained again, this time to the manager, her response was, ""I suggest you order something else, because the outside of the burger is going to be burnt and not cook the raw spots."" I was never offered a new burger. I ordered the pizza instead, and when my bill came, I was charged for the pizza. I had to request that the bill be adjusted. Again, I asked the manager directly. She said sure. The bill was adjusted. Since this was the kitchen's error (hello, raw turkey meat!), I don't think it unreasonable that I be offered a new burger, and then charged for the pizza. I would not recommend this place.The person next to my party ordered a new slice of banana creme pie. It came as a tiny tart in tin foil. Cost $8. When he addressed it with the manager (yup, same one), her response was, ""yeah, that sucks when you pay for something, and you're disappointed."" Sorry, that's unacceptable, and I don't think you need a Stern degree to recognize this. The manager then compared the Hamilton Inn to The Embankment and other restaurants. Not quite.

503,Tvoi-tiOiCg429kMoueysg,James M.,2.0 star rating,"I REALLY wanted to like this place. First, it was one of the only places open the day after the hurricane, so it had that, ""you can't keep us down"" attitude that you'll often find in  ABC after school specials. Just being able to sit down and de-stress put us in a good mood.It also had a great selection of 80's music playing, which was a lot of fun. I mean, if I walk in and ""The Safety Dance"" is playing, man, thats practically a 3 star review off the bat. Bonus if the guy who actually sang the safety dance is waiting on you. Which didn't happen, but by judging by the amount of other top ten hits Men Without Hats had, it could conceivably occur.For an App, the server recommended Asian Style Buffalo chicken wings. At first, it thought it was because my GF is Chinese-American, but I realized they were on the menu and stopped speed dialing the ACLU. This was the highlight of the meal, as they were crispy, but they kinda over did it on the soy sauce.Then the entrees. I had the pulled pork, which WAS tasty, with a touch on cinnamon, which I'll admit was an interesting. The issue however was the portion, which was really small. It was basically a dollop of pulled pork placed on a toasted roll. Very disappointing,  The fries were mealy and really added nothing except extra time on the treadmill later on. The GF's fish tacos were decent, but nothing special, certainly not going to be giving Rubio's a run anytime soon.  The side order of mac n' cheese was especially frustrating, because it appeared just to be regular kraft mac and cheese. Why charge 6 dollars for this?Even though this IS a 2 star review because our experience wasn't that great, I would definitely recommend trying this place.  Honestly, we probably will go back for another try ourselves. One, we went the day after the hurricane. It really might have been an off-night. Secondly, the atmosphere and staff were cool and seemed to really appreciate the patronage.

My 3 friends and I came for brunch about 2 months ago on a Sunday at 11:30. The wait was an hour, which we expected so that was fine with us. The place is tiny so there was no room to wait inside. It was pretty cold out, so we made a quick run to Starbucks, sat for a while, and came back an hour later. When we went to check with the host an hour from when he originally told us, he said there was still a wait but he wasn't sure how long. He seemed really stressed out and I felt badly to push the issue, so we waited outside another 25 minutes. When we went in to check again, the same host said 15-20 minutes. 20 minutes later, the host said AGAIN another 15-20 minutes and apologized with an attitude. We waited another 20 minutes (total of over 2 hours waiting outside in the cold at this point), and then went inside to ask again. AGAIN we were told ""only about 10 more minutes."" We had already waited so long, we figured another 10 minutes couldn't hurt. Long story short it was almost 3 hours of waiting outside in the freezing cold when we decided to just go somewhere else to eat instead. Their brunch ends at 3 and it was almost 2:30 anyway. When we went in to tell the host to take our names off the list, we overhead other people saying ""they called in a reservation an hour ago"" and were seated. This means we could have just called from outside when we were waiting and maybe we would've been seated. Absolutely ridiculous. It's a shame because we were really excited to try this place, but I'll never go back again.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
514,9LNKSIN49SrT24eZHCYivw,Randi E.,4.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I caught the tail end of Hudson County Restaurant Week, starting at the Hamilton Inn  for dinner on Wednesday. We both decided to get the $35 prix fixe, but we got add-ons because the deals were too good to miss.Wednesday at Hamilton Inn is half priced cocktail night, taking a delicious cocktail from $12 to $6, making it even more worth it. The two that we chose were pretty tasty. The one I had (Third Trophy Wife) was thick, sweet and tart, while my  boyfriend chose the Hamilton Inn Margarita, which was cool and refreshing. Another deal of the night was $1 salt oysters, so we indulged in our love of raw seafood, we ordered four. The freshness was overwhelming and the oysters were meaty and smooth.For our starters we ordered the crab cake and the pierogies. Both sound pretty basic, but the layers of flavors was substantial. The crab cake was served with a baby salad of microgreens and what they call a sriracha aioli. The faint crunch of the delicate greens played nicely off the soft stringy texture of the crabcake, while the aioli added the element of heat to the dish. The pierogies were stuffed with potato and goat cheese, topped with caramelized onions, and served with a dollop of truffle sour cream. I was afraid that all the flavors would be too strong--the heavy balsamic note of the onions, the potent punch of goat cheese and the aromatic truffle-- and would compete and end in disorder. But instead I was surprised with a harmonious competition, because each flavor hit different notes at different times, but helped the other flavors to their shining moment. And the crunch of the outside and smush of the inside was lovely.For an entrée my boyfriend ordered ribs that came with a red cabbage slaw and cheesy mashed potatoes. The meat was cooked perfectly, falling off the bone, soft and manageable, and the mashed potatoes were very smooth but not too cheesy. The only downside I found was the barbeque sauce. It was a little too sweet for my liking. We both were longing for some kick to even out the flavors. But we found the kick in my Pappardelle with crabmeat entrée. My tomato sauce was like an arrabbiata sauce, spicy, thick and colorful, littered with wilted grape tomatoes and succulent crabmeat. The homemade pasta was delicious and thick (how I like it), serving as the perfect foundation for the heat of the sauce and the cool of the sprinkled crabmeat. The whole meal fell very flat at the end with the desserts. There were only two options on the menu, so we ordered one of each. The flourless chocolate cake, although good, was not my ideal. I knew what I was in for, but I wish it wasn't so chocolaty. Loved the texture and the melty vanilla icecream, just not the overwhelming chocolate. The other was a banana cream pie, which was difficult to eat. The crust was so sweet, crunchy, and thick it was impossible to break easily with a spoon. It was like all the sugary deliciousness turned into a candy in the oven, making it incredibly hard. The filling was unsatisfactory and almost unpalatable. It felt fake and left a film on our tongues. But we decided we would deffo go back, because the food food was absolutely delicious, and the service and atmosphere were friendly and trendy.",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

However, I went in today looking forward to a yummy meal that I've been enjoying a lot lately, only to find they changed their menu this week. The only chicken sandwich is fried (which I can't have) and the artichoke appetizer I love was replaced with unhealthy fried food. I went for the Ahi Tuna Club and it wasn't good.

522,5rL4OuhdE_ybWSzCvTWOPA,Rosie C.,5.0 star rating,"On Sunday nights, the Hamilton Inn is the place to be! Why, you ask? Half-priced bottles of wine! This special makes for a wonderfully wine sloshed evening (try the amazing Nieto Malbec, which is an overhwelming favorite that ends up being close to retail price) that is more than worth the trip.Cheap booze isn't the only reason to visit this throwback neighborhood spot--food is finger-licking good, prices are generally recession-friendly, and the vibe is relaxed. I've been slowly working my way through the menu, and my faves are the Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders (lettuce, avocado, tomato, super spicy aoili), which I often eat as my entree; the East LA Fish Tacos (avocado, pico de gallo, sour cream), which have some of the same seasonings as the sliders; the Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, which can be ordered as a side for an additional charge if you ask nicely; and the Candied Pecan Salad (field greens, pears, warm goat cheese, balsamic vinaigrette) with the most amazing fried goat cheese balls of all time. If they had a side of those magical goat cheese balls, I would order two. Which would probably be a good idea since my boyfriend and I have been known to fight over the last one in the salad. Seriously. Word to the wise: order two salads.Speaking of my boyfriend, who is even more knowledgeable about the menu than I am, his favorites are the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies (truffled sour cream, carmelized onions), French Dip (sliced filet mignon on ciabatta, creamy horseradish au jus), and Barbecued Ribs (PBR-braised and smothered in homemade sauce).To be completely fair, I must mention some of the not-so-hot menu items we've had: the Ahi Tuna Club (too dry)and the Inn Burger (underwhelming overall), plus, my favorite salad seems overpriced for its size. And full disclosure, my bf had food poisioning after eating the Fish Tacos two weeks ago, though we both love the restaurant so much that I'm hoping to convince him to overlook it as a freak occurrence.A must-try for anyone in Jersey City, Hoboken, and the surrounding areas!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

They came with sour cream and guacamole that was probably from Costco. - House salad - that was pretty good. - Salmon and risotto - eatable - Pumpkin Ravioli - eatable, but also probably from Costco - Pasta with meat sauce - fine, but nothing special As for the service...also not very impressive.

If people show up to eat, and either because you accept reservations or because there's a long line of people, or because two thirds of your diners are there for birthday parties, whatever the case may be, you aren't likely to have a table free for more than a couple of HOURS, you should say so!You shouldn't say: ""Oh, it's going to be a while, 30 minutes or so, is that alright?""Because you know what, people will wait. People will stand in the cold for half hour because they don't want to constantly be in the waiters' and other patron's way, and then, pissed off, they'll wait inside. For an hour and a half. Not just 30 minutes and then leave. And then when they see you, Ms. Hostess, seat about five parties, knowing full well they were number three on the list, they'll ask: ""how many more minutes do you think it'll be since it's been a few more than just 30?""If you ""check"" your list, and nobody's been crossed off from in front them, you've seated FIVE PARTIES,  and you can't give a straight answer about whether or not the parties seated had reservations?? be prepared to lose customers.

549,1Yq4N8_Ezn7PO-uflf3QEw,Meghan H.,5.0 star rating,"Had a really good experience at Hamilton Inn this evening.  We made reservations for 8pm and arrived shortly before (less than 5 minutes early).  When we arrived, the host let us know that the table he had set aside for us had two folks at it that were nursing their drinks and generally taking much longer to finish than expected.  He asked us if we'd mind sitting at the bar while they finished.  He was generally apologetic and we really appreciated his tone about the situation, and as we certainly weren't in a rush and the bar wasn't crowded, we sat down and ordered a couple drinks.We had our drinks and were waiting for a bit, but it was pleasant.  The table they had set aside for us still didn't open up, but a different table opened around 8:15, and they came over to seat us.  Before we could even ask about transferring our bar tab to our check, they told us that our first round was on the house because of our wait.  I was floored by that level of customer service and solicitousness.  I'm not used to restaurants taking reservations that seriously, and it just set off our experience on the right foot.The food was also quite good.  Top-notch American fare.  We got the French onion soup dumplings as an appetizer - a nice twist on an old standard.  For the main course, my husband got the Wagyu burger (side note: he asked the waiter which he'd recommend between the burger and the steak frites and the waiter recommended the burger; I always appreciate an honest opinion even if it means the waiter is recommending the less expensive dish) and I ordered the ahi tuna club sandwich.  Both of the main dishes were good enough to basically preclude conversation.  And as a bonus, we had enough room to order dessert - we split the banana cream pie.  So good.As a bonus, the prices are really quite reasonable, and the service is attentive but not at all smothering.  Given that we had at least three other dishes we wanted to order, we will certainly be back.  Great neighborhood place!(The rating might be a little inflated.  I think the food was a very solid four.  But I was so very happy with their service and attitude toward the customer that I had to go with the 5-star rating).",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It has a dimmed setting indoors and offers outside seating(if weather permits). With this being my first time there, I chose to ask for recommendations. Server seemed to prefer all the highest priced items on the menu. I ended up getting their wings to start off. If you get stuck choosing between the wing flavors, get the Asian BBQ wings. Really juicy and the sauce was so good you could drink it. Also had the truffled egg pizza. The amount of truffle in that pizza was perfect. The egg on the top added a creaminess that finished it off nice. My main entree was the INN burger. I believe it was their house burger which was really good. The one thing that got me was the additions on that burger. The additions made the burger go from affordable to overpriced. Trust me, I'm not a picky or unreasonable person. The burger jumped from $10 to $20. You tell me what you think. The burger otherwise was very flavorful and cooked just the way I asked. All in all, I think the food was well worth the trip.

And the point is there are not that many restaurants around the the Hamilton Park area to be compared with. Neighborhood gem? That's because there are very few gem in this area...I live around Grove Street, but not by Hamilton Park. This morning I past here and liked the brunch ambience, so I decided to go back to try their dinner which turns out a big disappointment.I ordered a lobster roll which costs $18, and the roll was just the size of a hotdog bun or even smaller. Part of the bun was burned completely toasted. The lobster stuffing is decent, but the whole thing doesn't worth $18. The dish is supposed to come with a side of french fries, but I asked the waitress if I can sub it for asparagus which is also on the menu for sides. On the menu, both french fries and asparagus are $6 if you order them for sides, but when I asked them to sub it for asparagus, they wanted to charge me $2 more. I don't get it?? The manager came to explain it's because they give out bigger portion for of french fries when you order a side of french fries, compared to what they would give you in a dish....What?? I still don't get it? But why does it have anything to do with my asking to sub for asparagus? I guess they just wanted to charge me more. Only $2, so fine! And guess how many asparagus that came with the dish after I had to pay $2 more? 8 pieces of asparagus....haha! I can only laugh now! (So basically 8 pieces of asparagus cost $8....this is the most expensive asparagus I've ever had in my life - $1 each!)If you have no other places to go in this neighborhood, then I guess you would say this place is great.

In fact I've been back 4x's since I've giving it a 2nd chance! To start the decore is cozy and has a homey feeling with out being dated!   The service was friendly and attentive and very knowledeble on the menu and wine list!   For appitizers the French onion Dumplings are AMAZING.. served in an escargo plate its quirky, comforting... perfectly seasoned, perfectly browned.. this app is a 10!  We also ordered the wings which in my opinion are the best in NJ. For our entree's we have tried the Filet Mignon and braised short ribs which were both cooked perfect and seasoned excellently! The wine list isn't extensive but decent..  the only negative I can say is that the White sangria is a little watered down and bla..however with SUndays being 1/2 price bottle of wine night it wont be missed!   We will definetly be returning to this new JC favorite!!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The place has a completely cool bar vibe on the inside. All the staff is super friendly and helpful. We ordered BBQ wings, but they brought us Buffalo. Even though they promptly fixes their mistake, they still gave us the Buffalo wings to keep also, which I thought was a nice touch. The food was delicious. I got a turkey burger with sweet potato fries and had to double check that it was in fact turkey and not beef because it was the most delicious and juicy turkey burger I've ever had. Can't say enough good things about this place.

But I'd been disappointed too many times in the past and had sworn off of it.I went back only because I had heard they had new owners. NOT TRUE according to our server.BUT TO BE FAIR-- the food was improved. Well, the entrée at least. The nachos were a disappointment...a little greasy. And are those chips deep fried??The chicken entree was very good. A simple dish- crispy skin, moist and meaty- the asparagus needed a little more work- very overdone. And I might suggest less gravy or putting it on the side, to let the crispy skin shine, otherwise you risk it getting soggy very fast!Now, all they need to do is up their game with the bartenders. My cocktail Hendricks, tonic, light ice and cucumber lack the zestiness and crisp taste that I'm used to at others places in the neighborhood.I'll come back and try this place again....cause I really want to like it!!!!!",The Hamilton Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Desserts,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I was not around for the Hamilton Ale House, but for now, what the neighborhood has to offer, the Hamilton Inn is nice. As for drink choices, they have a good list of drinks for everyone, but I would hope that they would offer drink specials or a happy hour. I sat at the bar mainly, and have been there on 3 occasions. It's a comfortable place to meet for a drink. As for the menu, it is a good choice of common upscale pub-fare. However, I am not a fan as much. I think the portions are small and the flavors are nothing to write about. I would be a bit more enthusiastic , if the prices were justified for the menu or portion size.

I really liked the ricotta cheese that they brought out for the bread.I got a Caesar salad for an app, which was just okay. I had one friend get the calamari, which was a normal app size, and 3 friends got the crab cakes, which was one small cake per person. The size of the crab cake app didn't seem to match up to the size of the calamari. We all got the penne vodka, which was good. For dessert 4 of us got the creme brulee, and I liked it. One friend got the pecan pie and didn't like it. The service was fast and our waiter was very attentive.
