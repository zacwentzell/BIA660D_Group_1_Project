The place seems to always be filled with college students on their laptops - after all, it is right by the Stevens Institute - so if you're a really big group, don't expect to be able to fit everyone at one table/area. Other than that, the employees were super nice and the girl who rung me up was very sweet as well. As far as food, I only ordered the chai tea latté, so I can't say much on behalf of their bakery items - they did have a little glass case full of them - but the latté was good. Nothing fancy or outrageously delicious, but definitely good, and piping hot, if I might add.

The ingredients sounded fresh, but they weren't. It was too sweet for my taste buds. If you get it and don't like things to be too sweet, let them know. The space is very welcoming. It was buzzing with people chatting, reading studying and catching up with friends. They had a few baked good options on the menu that were gluten free but for the price they looked tiny and not so appetizing. I didn't try.There was also an overpriced shop area in the back. I usually like that stuff but it is situated too close to where people were drinking coffee. As I was browsing the items I felt like I was getting too close to coffee sippers around me. I might as well have sat on top of their tables. My first impression was a miss... But the place was full so they must be doing something right.

I wanted a pastry of some sort and  when I got there on a Saturday mid day they didn't have much (image with review). I was sudden that nothing to my liking was there, therefore I stuck with a ""drip"" coffee, which was delicious. My friend ordered some tea which was also to his liking. We sat down and just watched at the Saturday interactions happened, which was peaceful. The music selection was ideal and gave me that welcoming feel. I loved the exposed white colored brick wall, it added to the Kafe. They have seating outside, but it was a little chilly to sit outside, but a few people still did all bundled up in their scarfs and coats, it was kind of perfect if you just wanted to enjoy the fresh air and drink your coffee. We thought this place would even be perfect for blogging, escaping the office, have an interview, or even a date. I hope you take a few minutes to stop by as we did before out Washington street shopping began. To make this adventure even more complete I meet Rosie the doodle, she was sooo adorbs sitting outside on one of the benches, very friendly.

I've certainly had better gluten free vegan chocolate chip cookies but the one at Bwe actually tasted pretty clean and not so unhealthy - not too sweet or fattening.  It was also thin and flat which tricked me to think I was eating a huge cookie but I'm sure it's equivalent to a regular sized cookie.  They have two cases of pastries next to each other.  I thought only one case contained gluten free vegan pastries but according to some reviews here, other pastries such as sticky buns and blueberry danishes in the other case are also gluten free and vegan...?

It has a very charming exterior with two or three tables to sip your beverage if the weather avails. Once you enter, you are met with a gorgeous espresso machine, gleaming proudly as light pours in through the large windows. The walls showcase resplendent local art along simple white brick. There are selves that have a variety of trinkets and merchandise to buy, all of which work as accent pieces to the decor. Along the right wall are several boards with information about the café's cause (the purification of water in Haiti), the café's schedule at large, and the menu. The menus are explicit and the selection is replete with tea and coffee to suit a spectrum of tastes.The interior is equally as simple and charming. Seating was no issue on a Saturday evening, although I'd imagine Fridays are a bit different. You will find the odd hipster with glassy eyes on his computer, poised to type, while sipping his artful latte. Might I add, the latte art is top tier. I was poured a stunning rosetta.I sat on a stool facing the window for a street view. My mom ordered a tea that was a gorgeous deep, rhubarb color. I think it was an herbal, berry tea. The ice was crushed and the tea was delightfully potent. I bore the kind of potency that pinches your cheeks and plays on your taste buds.  I first ordered a café au lait and wasn't satisfied with the taste. I returned to the counter and ordered a latte, met with the same pleasant disposition from the first order. The latte was creamy and full-bodied, the espresso had a nutty quality that was scrumptious. I can't imagine how satisfying it'd be on a cool fall evening.The place itself is a bit hushed but one could definitely make friends with the staff and foster a casual comraderie, I'm sure.

I took a sip of a mildly under-sweetened latte here, and I must say that I was both impressed and reminded of my hatred of lattes. Bwè boasts the most comfortable seating area of any coffee shop in 'boken, at least in my humble opinion.  The window area was an absolutely delightful fortress of the complete lack of solitude in a busy coffee shop, as I was attempting to get some writing done. The dark roast was not overly burnt, as is annoyingly fashionable by any respectable Java dispenser in an upscale setting. Every blend contains Haitian beans, claimed the exceedingly pleasant and damned good-looking barriatocrats doling out caffeinated beverages to the public. I think I can confidently conclude that this is the best coffee shop in the 'boken tundra, or at least the next best thing to a book store or a library. It feels odd to make the latter comparison, but if loitering is the chief purpose of such places, one could do a lot worse.  Oh, and last but not least, the Maya Angelou quote written on the chalk board and the Beatles providing the background music are all greatly appreciated, Bwè staff.

Great atmosphere to get things accomplished as mostly everyone in a seat is productively jamming away at a paper, proposal or resume. Getting a seat can sometimes be a challenge, but it's worth the wait. My only complaint, if I have one, is that the music is too loud. I like that they have tunes playing, but I don't think they need to be so loud that I can't drown them out at a respectable volume with my earbuds.  Their open mic nights are fun and different for Hoboken, and give a true city vibe/feel to the town.",bwè kafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea"

The baristas were friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was relaxed.I really enjoyed my large iced coffee ($3). Their large size is what I would typically call a small though, and they serve the coffee with tiny ice cubes that melt really quickly. I practically chugged my coffee because I didn't want it to get watered down. There is also a big tea selection and they offer a variety of baked goods (muffins, scones, cookies, etc.) and some items are gluten free. I ate a cinnamon walnut scone that was nothing special, but tasted good.The spaciousness of bwè allows for plenty of tables/chairs inside, plus there is outdoor seating in the front.

I heard a ton of hype about this place, and like most things it seriously failed to live up hype. I ordered a latte and iced coffee, the iced coffee was seriously blah, and they put this strange ice in it that just melted one block after taking it out of the store. The latte was just pathetic, and with zero micro foam care and skill. The had about a 5-6 wifi hogs taking most of the seating (these people most account for some of the positive reviews). So basically, they butcher the worst selection of la colombe coffee, but they do sell trinkets and small artwork...so i guess thats a plus??

It has a great energy and could honestly spend hours here talking to the owners and other people from around town. What a great local spot!Now, about the goods: They're wonderful! The coffee has a smoothness to it that you can't get anywhere else in the 'boken, their smoothies are amazing, cookies and other foods are as fresh as can be!I also feel great coming here knowing that some of the money goes back to helping build Haiti after their horrendous earth quake a couple of years ago. They are committed to their philanthropic routes and never knew that buying a cup of coffee could make me feel so good inside!A+ for this hang out!",bwè kafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea"

There is a complete dearth of interesting, trendy places in this entire city. There are so few cool. local spots around here, especially in the way of coffee shops. Bwe is probably a 4 in terms of general atmosphere and such (you'll find cooler in Manhattan and Brooklyn, of course), but my goodness this staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious. 5 stars it is. Welcome to the neighborhood.",bwè kafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea"
