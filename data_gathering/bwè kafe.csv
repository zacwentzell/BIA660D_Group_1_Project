The inside is super cute like I said, I get sort of an island vibe from it. When I read the history online, bwe is a Haitan (sp?) word so I can see where I got the island vibe from. It is always busy with people at the computers at work. When I went with my friend, it was very quiet almost like a library so we had to whisper which is ok. Their coffee selection is good & prices are reasonable. I got a latte while my friend got a mocha latte. To put almond milk costs extra.

It's nice to see a smaller place thrive in the area and for good reason. The staff is incredibly nice, genuine and helpful. Possibly the nicest bunch I've ever met and interacted with at a coffee place. It's my perception they genuinely care about coffee and you find that in the coffee they serve and their method of preparation. It's an art.I personally by a few times a week to pick up my standard Americano. It's the best americano in the area unlike other places which serve extremely bitter and watered down americano. The americano is so rich and smooth, the way Americano should b. The only food I've tried is the pistachio cake which I really liked! I was surprisingly not too sweet which I liked and had a hint of rose flavor in it. It paired well with my americano. I ordered it on recommendation for the staff and was very happy with it! Bwe kafe also has sandwiches, breakfast foods and pastries. They recently started serving gelato from a local gelato place. I tend to grab and go but occasionally sit down to read. It's a nice, peaceful environment to sit in and read a book or meet a friend for coffee and conversation. You also get a pretty view of the Manhattan skyline as an added bonus. Pretty interior decor and design too! No wifi on the weekends though if you're planning to do computer work.

60,f-gyTX2RSinH7COsn0UInQ,Cat V.,4.0 star rating,"This is the second location - first is located on the north end of Hoboken. I've been a fan of bwe coffee since I came back to the area a few years ago. Like the other location, it has a mellow hipster vibe with modern chic decor (i.e. white paint, light wooden furniture, exposed brick/piping). Always love to try something new out of their coffee (fair-trade/partner with La Colombe) selection especially since a certain percentage of proceeds go to support Haitian youth. So you can feel good about intentionally choosing to drink coffee here where you're contributing to making a difference for someone else :)The staff are always helpful and friendly, some work at both locations so its nice to see a familiar face. The price is a little more than I'd usually pay but again the quality and reason behind it are worth it. Lots of seating from standard table and chairs to sofa seating and long-table, sharing. They provide all your coffee/tea fix-ins at a table parallel to the register and coffee bar (ie. milk, cream/half n half, agave/honey, sugar, napkins, stirrers, utensils, etc). They also have a refrigerated shelving unit with sparkling water, fruit juices, and yogurt and sell some wholesome baked goods as well. There's a clean and handicap accessible restroom. However, one of my biggest issues with this second location is the parking. It's metered street parking, which due to the huge construction of luxury condos in the Newport area is costing you $0.25 per 10 minutes. Best to take the light rail ($2.50 for single ride) or PATH to Newport ($2.75 for a single ride).

Some may call this lazy, but I'm not walking any further than I need to when it's cold outside :) So I usually go to Starbucks for my soy chai fix. Anyway, my birthday is tomorrow and I'm not in the office today (I take actuarial exams, so today is a study day for me - yay!), so I figured why not give bwe a try for an early birthday treat. I prefer almond milk over soy milk, so when I saw the almond milk option I was already sold. So I got a large Almond Chai. As I sit here sipping my almond chai, I'm wondering WHY?? Why did it finally take me so long to try this place out? The chai is incredible. It has the kick you want from a chai that many commercial establishments cough cough don't have. I can't speak for the coffee (although my boyfriend enjoyed his mocha) but the chai here is definitely comparable to Birch Coffee (one of my favorites) in the city. SO GOOD. They also have a loyalty program - buy 10 drinks, get one free. So that's always a plus.Regarding bwe itself, there are a good amount of seats to sit and do work. There's also great lighting and the space feels very open and relaxing. About half full on a Tuesday at 10:30am.  Definitely less crazy than the other coffee establishment nearby.

Only the second day since opening it's doors this Bwé Kafe offers a super chill vibe, already more chic & Urban Outfitter-esque than it's Hoboken sister though just as wood heavy. Attracting families & hipster yuppies alike this cafe, full of natural light and a relaxing view of the Hudson, offers great coffee with a cause for all! All their blends have beans from Haiti and they contribute to Love for Haiti (an organization that supports grass roots educational projects) and Coffee for Water (an organization that provides clean drinking water to schools, hospitals and orphanages). As if coffee didn't make me feel good already now I'm drinking for a good cause! Definitely a great cafe to get some work done, missing the intimacy & conversational vibe of Modcup. The space and coffee bar reminds me of the La Colombe location on Lafayette near NYU sans the huge bar in the middle. Unsurprising that they would adopt a similar style as they do brew and serve most La Colombe coffees considering their love of helping Haiti. Though this bar is far more petite and perhaps can't accommodate more than 4 drinks at any given time, don't think there will be a ""morning rush"" here more of a ""grab coffee and chill"" kind of place.

I'll pay $3 for a large cup of drip coffee with that in mind. Their food options are mostly of the gluten-free and organic types... very expensive chocolate bars, etc. I'd love to seem them connect with a local bakery and offer some breakfast pastries.There's probably room for about a dozen people to be working before it gets crowded. I came in around 1pm on a weekday and it was pretty full of people working on laptops, having meetings, etc. I can imagine that this place will get pretty good business from nannies and stay-at-home parents as well as the work-from-home professionals.

The staff is friendly, the coffee is consistently good and there is a small selection of baked goods. I've read a few reviews complaining about the no wifi on weekend policy. The same people complain having to wait for a seat when they visited the cafe. That's the problem, students and freelance workers hog tables and seats for HOURS while sipping their $3 coffee while other patrons and paying customers don't have a place to sit. So I for one LOVE the NO WIFi policy. If you're going to sit on your laptop and hog an entire table while paying patrons look for a place to sit and enjoy the coffee and bakes goods they've paid for, then stay home on your own wifi or visit your public library. It's a cafe, not an office, conference room or library!!  Here's an idea, on weekends try sitting across form a breathing human being and having a conversation rather than banging away on your keyboard... you may like it!I'm sure it's clear that these people piss me off!
