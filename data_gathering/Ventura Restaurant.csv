1,_3GXviI4n0q_R2pTcyXJbQ,Janice B.,5.0 star rating,"I tried their pork with rice and beans and chicken empanada. Absolutely delicious. Really feels like homemade warm food. It was cheap, with a drink costs about $10. More suitable for to go because it has just few counter seats. I was in town for a couple of days definitely would recommend this place over any fancy joints around. People are very friendly. Seemed very popular among locals.",Ventura Restaurant,5.0 star rating,,Dominican
