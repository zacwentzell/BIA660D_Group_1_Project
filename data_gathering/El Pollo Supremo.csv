0,w3czn31CGNmzHFtsWxmuVg,Denise C.,4.0 star rating,"It seems as though this location of El Pollo Supremo gets mixed reviews on almost all the social media sites. However, I'm happy to say I've never had a bad experience here. Only once did I stray from the chicken and get something different (tacos, which came three to an order and were just fine). Chicken has always been tender, flavorful, and juicy. I like their congri rice. My favorite side, though, is their fried yuca. A small order is plenty and each time I've ordered it, it's been perfect: super crispy and golden on the outside, sinfully starchy and creamy on the inside. I don't find it to be terribly expensive as others have said. Generally, a single meal will run you about $6-8, but the portions are pretty filling (at least for me).  You won't stand around here because of slow service, it's because everything is made to order. I'm usually pretty impatient, but this has always been worth the wait.",El Pollo Supremo,3.5 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Cuban,, Chicken, Shop"

Ordered 2 orders of the 2 piece combo, rice and beans, fried bananas and a Snapple - under $20 bucks. The chicken was good, not earth shattering, but definitely worth a try. The rice and plantains were much better made. Eating area was clean. The bathrooms not so much.

6,zOBahND2nh49GcybXNC9Pg,Kerry B.,3.0 star rating,"Food gets 4 stars but had to deduct 1 point for service. This place is your average chicken spot. Relatively clean with a quick turnaround time for food to be ready. You'll find many patrons coming in and out at any given time. My major beef with them is lack of disclosure when something costs extra and this time around they did not give me the parts of the chicken I originally requested.Take-out is an extra charge and when I asked what drinks come with the takeout combo, they listed a plethora of drinks and then I chose the tamarindo drink. I thought the price was a little high when I left, but I was in a rush and the guy seemed a little apprehensive about me viewing my food before leaving. I glanced at it, but I was on my lunch break, working from home so I couldn't tarry.I get home, look at my receipt and open the box and lo and behold, there was a 50 cent charge for the drink and 30 cent charge for takeout. It's kinda silly considering it's pretty much the same kinds of containers for dine-ins. Why not just factor that into the cost in general? Then for the drink, he most certainly should have told me it was extra up front. I'm not going to lose sleep over 80 cents but it the mere principle of the situation. I have a right to know any info that might influence or impact my purchasing decisions.Insult to injury, they gave me a mangey help of a wing, dried up small leg and a thick chicken breast. I specifically asked for dark meat. I don't like white meat, especially when grilled and not cut up/butterflied as this is the driest part of the chicken and I like it juicy. On the bright side, at least the flavor was good. Will go again but will ask what's extra upfront and check my food before leaving.",El Pollo Supremo,3.5 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Cuban,, Chicken, Shop"
