We worked with Natalie (the event manager) to arrange everything at pretty much the last minute and she and the staff were so fab to work with. This is a great venue - bright, airy and spacious if you're looking to do a family get-to-gather, a birthday celebration or any event in general. They have family fun days over the weekend; face painting, balloon making, a band et al ... definitely a hug hit with kids of all ages. We chose Sunday for our small birthday celebration and it was perfect. We ordered party platters from the catering menu and our guests couldn't stop raving about the food - the jalapeno poppers, smoked wings, chicken tenders, fries and brisket were a hit. The drinks were great and Maria, our server was very accommodating. The space is airy and well lit and lends it self for great pics! There's also a small gaming arcade for kids at the back of the restaurant. Besides family fun weekends, House of Que has great lunch specials and live music nights.

H.,1.0 star rating,"Giving a 1 star review due to an experience we had with a bartender purposefully trying to overcharge us.   I came here on a Saturday during Dueling Pianos which is a lot of fun.  I went to the bar and asked the bartender about the wine selection to which he supplied me with a drinks menu.  On it, pretty much all the wines were listed at $7 a glass.  I pointed to the Sauvignon Blanc and requested 2.  The bartender came back with 2 cups of wine and told us the total was $28.  When I asked him how it can possibly cost twice as much as the list price on the menu, he at first avoided me before ultimately replying ""Yeah...they changed the menu and that's the price now"".  I found this suspicious being that I spotted several customers ordering from that very same menu and asked him, ""The price doubled on just this particular wine or all of them?""  to which he quickly responded ""All of them"" before quickly taking away the menu,  turning his back, and avoiding us. I was incredulous so went to a different portion of the bar and asked a different bartender whether the wine prices had in fact doubled overnight.  He indicated that this was NOT the case and the price was still $7.  Ultimately not the end of the world as we just ordered drinks from the honest bartender the rest of the night but wanted to give everyone a head's up as from what I'm hearing, this unfortunately wasn't an isolated incident so keep an eye out!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque
2,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"Although House of Que smells like bathroom cleaner, I must say that their brisket is actually pretty good.Our party of four showed up on a Thursday at around 6 and aside from what looked like a small company having a work HH, and a few families, the place wasn't too packed. We decided to go with the Pitmaster's Pick for 4 (1 lb of brisket, 4 ribs, 4 sausage links, half a smoked chicken, and 4 medium sides). The brisket was very tender. It needed a bit more flavor but the BBQ sauce definitely helped. The ribs weren't bad, the sausage links were tough and super salty, and the chicken was dry. As for sides, we got the collard greens (super salty), potato salad, beans, and cole slaw, which was great.While it wasn't the best BBQ, there don't seem to be a lot of BBQ options in Hoboken. That being said, if I come back, I'll just get the brisket and cole slaw, or maybe try one of their sammies.Tip - HH is Mon-Fri (11 am to 7 pm). Just don't get the 'house wine'.

They can pretty much sing anything!As for the food, the corn pudding is amazing. I thought it would be a cream since it said ""pudding"", but it was more like a corn bread served in a cup. The bread is buttery heaven, so moist and warm. The corn gives it some texture and additional flavor. I highly recommend trying it! I also had a BBQ chicken sandwich, but it wasn't as good. It had ok flavor, but the chicken is extremely dry. Expected much more from a BBQ place, especially when it boasts bringing Austin to Hoboken. Drinks are okay priced - $8-9 a drink. They make a great gin and tonic. Shots on the other hand, are pretty expensive. $8 for a shot in the small plastic cup.

We opted for the inside as it was very hot today.The staff here were very helpful and extremely friendly. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter who made a few recommendations for us. My group decided on a pound of the smoked wings naked and the Pickmaster's Pick combo with 4 sides. The combo includes 1lb of brisket, 4 ribs, 4 sausage links and half a smoked chicken. For the sides we got the mac salad, mac and cheese, slaw, and chili. The food unfortunately looked a lot better than it tasted minus the chicken. The chicken items were all surprising really good! My favorite was the smoked wings. Getting them naked really brings out the smokey taste and when dipped with ranch, it turns it into an epic appetizer. Everything else tasted okay. To be honest most of the items were very bland. Even when dipped with one of the two sauces provided it still wasn't that great. The sides were nothing to talk about either. It wasn't great but it wasn't so awful that it was not edible.Overall, this place is very average. I was extremely impressed by their staff and how quickly all the food came.

Used to come all the time, bring my friend's... that's when the bartenders were absolutely awesome. The only one still there is Rocco. Anyway so this time around... National Margarita Day, they get the promo wrong, terrible drinks and food was okay at most. First off, promo that was texted out was ""margaritas 1/2 price all day"", we get there and the bartender tells us it's frozen margaritas. Misled. Then she tells us after 7pm it's ladies 1/2 price bar, so okay now we order our spicy margaritas on the rocks, The weakest, most bland tasting drink we've ever had and the lowest grade of tequila. They never made them this way, just because you're running a promo you shouldn't change the quality of the drinks. Then the manager came around and asked how everything was and we told him the drinks sucked, he asked how and we took him just blah, no alcohol in it. He told us it was a new bartender and he will give us extra tequila.  That didn't work one bit, drink still tasted like trash. At the very least, he should've offered to remake the 2 spicy margaritas. Then it was bill time, he tells us he gave us a discount, sure it was like $2 off.

18,yKGaw3kHYtO5k6ejm6I8Ww,Katherine S.,4.0 star rating,"I have visited The House of 'Que on two occasions. My first visit was during the week at around 7 pm. It was comfortably busy and we were able to sit outside without a wait. Our waiter was friendly and did his job no problem. We started with beers and then decided to share a few appetizers. We had the Nachos with pulled pork added into them as well as the quesadilla and curly fries. All great choices, very happy with what we ordered. On my second visit we went on a Friday night at around 11 PM, where we sat at the outdoor side of the bar. We ordered 2 drinks each from the bartender who was great even with a busy inside bar. We then ordered a burger and fried pickle spears. Burger was super fresh with great flavor. Pickle spears were good as well but we were too full to indulge fully in them. The only thing I was not a big fan of was how loud the piano player was on the Friday night visit. The bar was not crowded enough for how loud he was performing and the performance was not entertaining enough to be such a focal point of the bar. While he did perform some songs that I totally loved and was able to sing along to, I do feel that it was a lot for the energy in the bar. I definitely think I would have enjoyed this aspect of the scene more if it was not so loud. Overall, both experiences were great. I love anything with outdoor seating and a good view, having great food totally brings the whole deal together. *Good food, good drinks, good service, outdoor seating, nice view, comfortable seating, good for groups, entertainment*",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

38,yKGaw3kHYtO5k6ejm6I8Ww,Katherine S.,4.0 star rating,"I have visited The House of 'Que on two occasions. My first visit was during the week at around 7 pm. It was comfortably busy and we were able to sit outside without a wait. Our waiter was friendly and did his job no problem. We started with beers and then decided to share a few appetizers. We had the Nachos with pulled pork added into them as well as the quesadilla and curly fries. All great choices, very happy with what we ordered. On my second visit we went on a Friday night at around 11 PM, where we sat at the outdoor side of the bar. We ordered 2 drinks each from the bartender who was great even with a busy inside bar. We then ordered a burger and fried pickle spears. Burger was super fresh with great flavor. Pickle spears were good as well but we were too full to indulge fully in them. The only thing I was not a big fan of was how loud the piano player was on the Friday night visit. The bar was not crowded enough for how loud he was performing and the performance was not entertaining enough to be such a focal point of the bar. While he did perform some songs that I totally loved and was able to sing along to, I do feel that it was a lot for the energy in the bar. I definitely think I would have enjoyed this aspect of the scene more if it was not so loud. Overall, both experiences were great. I love anything with outdoor seating and a good view, having great food totally brings the whole deal together. *Good food, good drinks, good service, outdoor seating, nice view, comfortable seating, good for groups, entertainment*",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

The macaroni and cheese was a bit on the mushy side, and the brisket chili was a bit on the dry side. The peach cobbler was ok, but same as the rest of the sides, isn't why you come here.

Since I only eat fish and poultry, it's hard for me to give y'all a good breakdown of the good and the bad. BUT, I can tell you this: they have a lot of options for every meat lover, and despite hearing that the meat might be slightly tough or dry, there's their house BBQ sauce and corn pudding that should make up for any void. They have live music - an added on plus for folks who love singing along while downing some brewskies. the impeccable service shall not go unnoticed. They have Bloody Mary specials on weekends until 3pm- you get to make your own, which is fun, but careful with the tops, as they easily come undone.The place is huge with some outdoor seating available as well.

We took the train into Hoboken, and the fact that this place is only a short walk away was a definite plus. Reservations can be made on OpenTable, and we were able to easily push ours back a half hour since we missed the earlier train. We were seated promptly, near the stage where they have live music, which was our only qualm as we had to shout a bit to hear each other talk. But we are pretty easy going and made the best of it. It was a warm night, so the windows were open to a patio area and offered great views of the city. The windows being open also offered extra bar-like seating facing into the restaurant, which I thought was a great use of the space.My party ordered the fried pickle spears, Texas 3 cheese nachos, state roll of Texas & two pitchers of the ruby red sangria to share. Everything was delicious. The only thing I would pass on for next time is the state roll of Texas which was a little too spicy for my taste (but for reference, my taste buds are sensitive to spice). I ordered the HOQ burger: a 1/2 lb ground beef & smoked brisket patty with lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, american cheese, queso & special sauce on a brioche bun served with fries. I also added the bacon option. I was so hungry and it smelled so good that I forgot to take a picture to show. It was cooked just the way I asked, medium well. Even though the burger was juicy, the brioche bun kept from getting soggy.We didn't stay for dessert this time, but I think it's safe to say that we will be back again for another low-key girls night out!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

This is where to go for Austin style smoky ribs, brisket or wings with a side of hospitality and a view of NYC.Came on St. Patty's Day last year. Owners were onsite and made everyone feel like VIPs. They went all out for the big day - free drinks and tshirts were given out. But the best part of the meal aside from the amazing food was the service - exactly what you would want from a small town like Hoboken. They were completely charming and dedicated to making sure every guest that walked in felt welcome. Such sweethearts! Made me like this place even more.The food was awesome. We got the lunch special for $13 with a taste of the ribs, brisket and sausage plus 2 generous sides. The ribs were meaty with a legit bark (a must for any good BBQ). Brisket was super tender. Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. Even the collards were delicious! Everything was so good and the place had such a great vibe that we ordered another round of ribs plus wings. Again, smoky and great portion. Can't end a meal like that without dessert - an enormous chocolate chip cookie served warm and warm peach cobbler. Do not leave without trying both. The design was also worth noticing. Lots of communal tables, huge booths and cafeteria style dining option make this the perfect place for groups. Every detail was perfect for Texas BBQ down to the tin ceilings with stars in the ladies room. Plus the whole place was spotless - no sticky menus, clean floors and it smelled only of good ol' bbq. This place gets everything right - food, service, vibe and decor. Does not always happen in Hoboken. We really needed this place.

I asked for two new beers about 30 min ago before my meal came out - I have since finished my meal and my beers never came.3. Speaking of meals -- I ordered the pound of brisket. 3 other people did as well. For a total of 4 lbs of brisket. They brought out one tray of brisket and a half tray combined with someone else's order and tried to pass it off as 4 lbs of brisket that were apparently supposed to be shared between the 4 orders even though we were all at opposite ends of the tables....also pretty sure that doesn't add up to 4 lbs....i would think that each order would come on a separate tray since, you know, they are all separate orders....they then tried to pass it up as a complete order and only came over 20 min later with magically 2 lbs of brisket after we had all tried to ration out the measly questionable 1.5 lbs on our table. This has been far from the only error of the night --  What a disaster. 4. There have been multiple occasions where they have come to our table with other peoples orders/food.

It was terrible and definitely one of the worst briskets I've ever had. I asked for fatty pieces but instead I got dry and tough pieces. Cutting it with a fork was not possible, if you told me it was top round I would have believed you.The pieces weren't even cut all the way through and were just plopped on the side of the plate.   Presentation counts for something, even if it's just properly layered and cut slices. It must have been the slicers first day since my pieces should have gone on a sandwich or something.One friend also got sliced brisket, and his portion has better than mine. It was fattier and could at least be cut with fork. I probably should have sent it back, but by the time I ate enough to know it wasn't going to get any better it was too late. Sometimes you just have to take the loss.Five other people seemed to enjoy their assorted sandwiches and salads, and the Palmer spiked tea got rave reviews from a few.

We also got a large Mac and cheese. The brisket was not bad but it was better with there BBQ sauce. The chicken was ok as well. The other people had the pork and they were not that impressed. The mac and cheese was not really that good either. There buffalo wings were probably the best thing we had.Now with respect to the server (Erika) she starts off ok by coming by and taking our order, but then she disappears. I even had to go get side plates from a vacant table since we waited so long. Never once did she really come back to check on us and it was a pain just to even get the check to pay.

A chopped brisket sandwich was on the small side, topped with a few slices of raw onion and some sauce, and rang in at $10.50 (the smallest sides were about $4.50 extra).

I asked if I could get the $2 extra shot to make it better... Our waiter disappeared. He came back and said no, I'd have to pay $10 for a regular shot. I complained that this drink was really disappointing. He went off to ask his manager and came back to offer to make me a new margarita drink with the shot in it, which was fine with me, but it took another 20 minutes to get it! But that was better, although not $12 delicious. It was equally difficult to pay our check. The food was mostly fine. We got ribs (1/2lb, or 3 ribs) and 1/2lb pulled park, both of which just served as a vehicle for barbecue sauce. The medium potato salad was terrible, under seasoned and mealy. The deviled eggs were probably the best, but still... Not really impressive or worth the price. I hope the dueling piano guys find a better place to play.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Food and drinks came our promptly.The food here, for a smokehouse is very WEAK for the HIGH prices you will pay. I have been to better bbq joints that were either family owned or commercial (think Famous Daves) but HOQ was a let down. The ribs were juicy and had flavor so did the chicken, but we ordered 4 sides and none stood out or were all that great. I'd have to say my most anticipated side in the bbq beans was the biggest underwhelming dish for me personally and everything else was just OK and I say that mildly.The menu seemed a little concise as well for the variety of bbq you can typically get. The prices? Lord, granted take note you are in Hoboken and this place sits right on the water but if you're inside and depending on which way you're seated that view is pretty much nonexistent. The sides were $5 each for a small, and a lb of ribs which was essentially (8) and a 1/2 chicken came to $16 and $9 respectively. Our bill was over $50 bucks.All that for mediocre bbq?

Upon being seated we asked if we would be able to try a sample and the staff was really nice about that. Despite that service is SLOW! My uncle ordered a sandwich and his fries weren't bought out until he was completely done! ( However the fries were apart of the meal). I had a rather light meal and went with the sides. I got the deviled eggs, mac & cheese and potato salad. Let me tell you the deviled eggs were AMAZING but then again how could one go wrong with that anyways? The mac& cheese was horrible and I was actually sad because I really wanted to like it but I couldn't. The potato salad was OK. Nothing I would come back for but it also wasn't horrible. Overall, this isn't a bad place but again it's just okay for a quick bite to eat. I probably wouldn't come back. I felt like trying this place out one time was good enough.

Other than that everything else was pretty bland and mediocre on top of overpriced. I lived in NC and have been to Texas and this BBQ just doesn't come close. It is no different than Smokin' Barrel uptown, at last they give you a side with a sandwich there.We came on a Friday night, it certainly wasn't packed but still enough people in there. The server came over and explained our options for either drinks from her and then food at the counter or order it all from her. I have been to Texas where you order everything from a counter but not the part where you pay separate for drinks so we opted for table service. The wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I got 1/4 pound of brisket, 1/4 lbs sausage and 1/4 lbs. of ribs (3 ribs). We got a side of mac n' cheese and brisket chili. Here's my run down:-Brisket - dry, cold and bland. It was a bunch of fat, it was tough and just not good, hardly any flavor.-Ribs - pretty pitiful, mostly smoke flavor, like there was no rub or anything put on them. Hardly any meat whatsoever.  -Sausage - This was by far the best of the 3 meats, it was pretty good, not amazing, but good. This would be the only thing I'd think about getting again.-Mac N' Cheese - Give me Kraft over this any day, bland, dry and just bleh. It was pretty bad. They either need to revamp this or remove it from the menu.-Brisket Chili - Actually not bad, but really just basic Chili that anyone could make at home. It was good but a side shouldn't be the best thing you order in a meal.-Pulled Pork Sandwich - Cold and hardly any pulled pork. I took a bite and it was all bread. I definitely would not order this.Sure they have great views and a ton of TVs which doesn't make a good restaurant. So if you think wall-to-wall TVs make it great than I don't know what else to tell you.

The first round was too sweet but I did order a second one and that one was nice and spicy. We ordered the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches with a side of mac n cheese, brisket chili and sweet peppers. The sandwiches were bangin. The meat was phenomenal and I honestly could have eaten seven of them. The chili was equally delicious-I wish I could make chili like that! The mac n cheese was a big let down for a BBQ place. It wasn't hot and it didn't seem to have very much cheese included with the pasta. Our waitress just seemed overwhelmed with everything and subsequently didn't really come to our table very often and the orders (food and drinks) just took forever.

It's good for Hoboken as families tend to take the tables so the bar area is separate. Lots of TVs as well so great for the games.  Can't wait to catch some baseball here in the summer!The menu has your standard Texas bbq choices though beef ribs weren't a option.  I had the pit master sampler with brisket, ribs, sausage and chicken.  Everything was cooked well, though the brisket was slightly overcooked IMO but overall I found that nothing was that flavorful.  I'm not sure if it was the time or if they rush the process but just didn't seem to have that deep smoked flavor and rub you expect from great bbq. I thought the brisket and chicken were good, the ribs ok and the sausage pretty bad.  I probably won't order that again.The sides were ok as well.  We had the Mac and cheese, potato salad and slaw.  Nothing bad but nothing memorable.My biggest complaint is that's it's very expensive for what you get which seems to be the biggest gripe about the place.  Increase the portions of sides slightly and maybe add some brisket and ribs with less sausage.  I also think they should just include gratuity because you order yourself but the waitresses brink drinks.  Does that deserve a standard 20%?  Overall the staff was friendly, and the food was decent.  While it's not the greatest BBQ it's good for Hoboken, and I'll come back in a month or two and maybe they will work out some of the kinks.  Good luck House of Que.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

111,s1s9ce3n73vRahPxUiXEzg,Cecilia G.,2.0 star rating,"I was really excited to try this place out especially bc they had just opened.  Been looking for a place in Hoboken where I can get my protein fix. Usually during the Grand Opening week, restaurants go beyond the usual to make a good impression so the word of mouth can spread.  Unfortunately, this place read the memo backwards.  For the amount of money I spent for the lunch special, the amount of meat I received was pathetic.   The ribs were 70% bone and the 1/2 sausage I got was nothing to call home about.  The one redeeming thing was the brisket, but they gave me only one piece.  For the lunch special, I was better off buying either the 1/2 chicken or just get brisket.  You're gonna get more meat buying their brisket sandwich than paying more for the special with 3 meats.   The sides were ""okay"" but the amount given was so small.  Maybe 3-4 bites?  You'll see bc the sectioned plates are really shallow.  Plus they didn't even have all the sides listed on their menu.  No black beans/corn salad.  When you see a place like this, the decor and everything looks great.  You expect to get food that is better than Dallas BBQ.  But the portions were worse, so you spend 30% more to eat 30% less.  Only thing worth getting was the brisket.  I'll update my review when if I decide to go back.  The sandwich we ordered... the bread was stale!!! It's grand opening week?!?  (face-palm) Seriously?   Service was mixed.  People serving were great, cash register people were friendly.  Hostess/waitress was nice.  Bus boy seemed lost and needs to smile and not talk so rough around the edges.  So they need to retrain some of the staff.  The beer selection is not as large as I thought it would be for a bar that size.  Maybe the owners and workers should all cross the river to Manhattan go to Hog Pit, Hill Country, Virgil's and see what they have to measure up against if they are gonna charge similar prices.I'm completely willing to update my review, but they better get their act together.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

The Pitmaster's Derby is a solid choice as well if you're looking for some bourbon. With regards to the food I went with portions of brisket, ribs and sausage with my sides being mac and cheese and beans. Honestly, the only food I would consider getting again was the sausage as it was cooked well and had some heat to it. The ribs and brisket were too fatty while the mac and cheese was too runny (perhaps it just wasn't my lucky day!).

We had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, chicken, brisket, and sausage - only complaint was sausage was a tad cold and the ribs were very fatty. Considering they were served by the pound we felt we paid too much for fat. Chicken was fabulously flavored. Corn bread pudding - give me the whole pan! Mac n cheese was good. The BBQ sauces were excellent! All in all not terrible would try again - but be cautious when ordering all those meats by the pound. Might be easier to get the meals that serve multiples.

The decor is awesome and the attention to detail is great.  When you walk in there is a large area to your right with picnic tables and a large projection screen, this area has a biergarten feel with a southern BBQ attitude.  On your left side there are high top tables, a very large bar and a bunch of TVs including a 3x2 grid of screens that can be programed as one large monitor or 6 separate.  Although they seemed to be having trouble getting this to work when we were there it was still impressive.  There are garage doors along the wall facing the water that open to the outdoor seating area (which I really look forward to taking advantage of once it gets warmer!)Food is set up cafeteria style, where you are handed a card telling you all of the delicious BBQ options, from sides to meats, to deserts.  We decided on the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich ($10.50) with a side of mac and cheese ($4.75) (pictured).  Both sandwiches were great our only complaint was that the mac and cheese was cold.     I will definitely be back to try some more great BBQ!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

With credentials from what may be the best BBQ place on the planet, Salt Lick outside Austin, Tx, the bbq here should be top notch. The brisket is good, but in my opinion, a bit drier and less marbled than the deep hearted red slices you get in Texas. With the tasty sauce on each table though, it is delicious. Better than the brisket though, were the amazing wings. These are cooked with a perfect crispy skin and imbued with strong tangy bbq flavor, clearly not just dumped on at the end. Even the blue cheese is better than average, I believe with the addition of buttermilk. Get your hands and face messy with some of these bad boys. The mac and cheese was just ok, only a little stronger than the boxed variety. The brisket chilli was delicious though. Perhaps a bit on the salty side, but it goes down well with a beer. The beer menu is a bit disappointing when comparing with the great craft beer scene in Austin as the only entrants here are Guinness, Sam Adams, and Shiner. Service was very friendly and the food came out incredibly fast. You can order at the table or go up to the butcher to select the pieces you'd like. The menu lists items by the pound, but you can go in ¼ or  1/2 pound increments as well. The ambiance is pretty authentic for Texas with wooden picnic tables, garage doors that open in the summer for fresh air, and even live music pretty often.

Came here on a double date after a day on the pier and as BBQ fanatics, we were all excited to try House of Que out given it's prime location on the waterfront. It was insanely expensive and all of the food was underwhelming. I'd go as far to say as the sausage and the mac and cheese was gross. The only thing I finished was my pickle.Service was also lacking. Our waitress came by once to deliver extra wet naps but drink orders were only taken once at the beginning.

I suggest just going with the brisket next time as you will be happy. The sides were good and average...collard greens were good and had a bit of a kick. The mac & cheese was watery and average. Full bar and I can see this place being super busy during happy hour as their windows in front are garage style and can be opened up to make it an outdoor experience.

I was there for the dueling piano show on Saturday night - the performers were good, fun, lively, played some great songs. However I had a real huge problem with the way this places seats people. It is absolutely absurd. They boast on their website that they have cafeteria style food service and I even heard one of the managers say it someone while we were there. However - they require you to put your name down to get a seat and they take reservations. Which is absurd if you are offering cafeteria style/self service. We got there and it was a 40 minute wait for a table. We were able to grab drinks at the bar and hang around but you need a table to put your food on so we couldn't eat. It probably took about an hour and half to get a drink. The managers were constantly apologizing to people. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and didn't really always seem like she knew when you were going to get your table. To top that off - they also offer waitress service. So its extremely confusing. You have the option of using your waitress or using the self serve option. This place NEEDS TO PICK ONE. If you are going to make people wait 1.5 hours to sit at a table and then tell them they can get their food at a counter on their own - absurd. If you are going to have counter service then you should allow people to pick their own seats. On a Saturday night - this is a bar  - not a restaurant - it is a bar with food and it should be treated as such. I also believe they should NOT take reservations - because it isn't a formal dining environment. It needs to figure things out. Also - they ran out of Fat Tire and PBR before 11 pm.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I decided I'm going to change that tact here as I have with my Waze App and other Apps. ;)We were at House of Que last week with two other couples (6 total) on Friday night, as one of the couples lives in Hoboken, and we all like to party there as its a fun town. We were all stoked, as we were all first timers. We didn't have a reservation and as walk-ins the hostess said it would be about 25 -35 min to be seated. So we gave our name and walked over to the bar to get drinks while we waited for our table. Bar area had a great vibe and was a fairly large, so it wasn't a struggle to get drinks (10min ?). Bartender was nice, yet more important was that our significant others are typically high maintenance about their mixed drinks, so when they all came out ""right"" the 1st time, I knew we were in the right place and we hadn't even eaten yet. We were seated in about 30 min, which was just fine. We were given the choice of ordering from the waitress or filling out our own menu card and walking up cafeteria style. We ordered from our waitress who was very helpful and attentive throughout our stay. We ordered  ""The Long Horn"" from the menu which included 2lbs of brisket, a whole chicken, 2 lbs of sausage and a few racks of ribs. WIt also included 4 orders of sides: we got the brisket chili, mac & cheese, corn (bread) pudding (to effin die for) and Texas cole slaw. The brisket was sliced in varying thicknesses and the thinner slices just literally melted in your mouth, and the thicker slices were spot on. The chicken was very tasty, which the ladies eventually had trouble sharing with us. The sausage was also very juicy (although it needed to be served warmer) and the ribs were fall off the bone and had super flavor (took some of these home as we were stuffed). All the sides were great, with the corn bread pudding being so over the top and only lasting all but 2 min., so we ordered some more of that ! We were all too stuffed to try dessert. (next time we'll take more home so we can fit it in). All of us are into smoked meat joints and were therefore excited to have this place open up. Our waitress brought us another round of drinks, and since they have live music, we stayed for another hour+ drinking. We all agreed we'd come back here in heartbeat and can't wait for the good weather to eat outside. Thanks House of Que - until next time !!

164,oV2C99bdHMtgaTA4-2qDyA,Stephanie G.,3.0 star rating,"Boyfriend wanted to try this place because BBQ options around town are pretty scarce, and it's been a while since we had some smokehouse food.We walked in and loved the ambiance- it looks very ""hill country"" and was hoping the food would be on par. The owner came by the table and introduced himself and told us about some of the events they have on the weekend, and he was really friendly, so far a good experience. However, at the end of it all I was turned off for a few reasons:- They don't serve french fries. Maybe it's not authentic to do so, but I've eaten my fair share of BBQ and have always had fries on the side (i'm also obsessed with fries so it probably bothered me more than most people).- The sides are very expensive for what you get. we got the deviled eggs and Mac n Cheese- we only got 3 halves of deviled eggs for $5.00 (it said $4.75 on the menu but were charged $5) my question is.. where is the other half of that second egg? the Mac n Cheese was just so bland, there was the texture of cheese but really no flavor.- The bun they serve the brisket on is akin to one you'd get from Burger King- way too soft to eat a brisket sandwich on. The brisket itself was fine, but it was plain. It's strange they add coleslaw to the pulled pork sandwich and not the brisket.Overall, I wouldn't come back for the food, but it seems like the nightlife could be where their success is.

Just try not to hold up the line ogling the meats, cause they are sexy as hell as they come out of the pit.I'd say definitely go for the brisket and pulled pork; those are (in my experience) the best offerings. The ribs are pretty good, but are definitely better with a bit of sauce. The sausages, unfortunately, are pretty weak and tasteless. As for the sides, none are outstanding, but drizzle some of the table sauces on the mac and cheese and it becomes absolutely incredible.

Between the dueling live pianos and the humongous tv's showing sports, the vibe can be a bit jarring upon entering this restaurant. But things seem to level out once you adjust to your surroundings (yeah it's a little loud on a Saturday night - but it's fun!). I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers on here. I thought the meat was flavorful and far from dry. The brisket and the ribs both had a good pull to them, not the melt in your mouth overcooked mush that you get at some BBQ places. My only advice to anyone trying this place for the first time is don't expect your typical seasoning on the BBQ ribs. There was definitely something different going on there, I don't know it that's how they do things in Austin or if that's just the chefs own recipe; but it's different. As everyone else has mentioned the corn pudding is amazing. Definitely order a large portion of you have more than 3 people in your party. That was by far our favorite side dish. The Mac and Cheese comes in second. A nice blend of cheeses seasoned with a hint of nutmeg - don't turn up your nose, try it! Their BBQ sauces are a nice balance of tangy and sweet; and served on the side like it should be when it comes to real Texas BBQ.  The sausage is pretty good too and all of their meat had a rich smoked flavor that I was still thinking about the next day.Service here is excellent. The women who work here are sincere and you never have to wonder where your waitress wandered off to. I didn't try any of their signature cocktails but they all looked good and averaged about $12 each. Overall a great dining experience right on the bank of the Hudson River overlooking the NY skyline.

171,Q6nr9knioE35uthtm2RAEw,Ryan C.,5.0 star rating,"I'm pretty confused by some other reviews on here that are putting down this place unnecessarily.  Yes, it is hoboken and you are going to pay a premium on food and drinks as you would in Manhattan.  It is not located in central Texas where you would pay half the price so go in there knowing this fact (as you would think most people dining in Hoboken already would).  And yes, it is newly opened so naturally the service needs to be worked out a bit.  With that being said, this is the first legitimate bbq spot in hoboken that actually smokes their meat and the food, drinks, service, and space are all great!Food:The brisket, depending on the cut, can be really good or a little dry.  This is true anywhere that smokes brisket.  Some other restaurants may not serve the leaner cuts that are a bit dry, but if you want a fattier, juicier cut then ASK for the fatty brisket.  I've gotten it twice and both times it was EXCELLENT.  On par with many bbq restaurants in the city.The sausage is top notch, just get it.The pulled pork is also very good.  It may need some extra bbq sauce to your liking but if you like pulled pork you wont be disappointed.I haven't tried the ribs yet.Sides - I really like the corn pudding, deviled eggs (though are a bit small), and cole slaw.  The mac and cheese is a little less cheesy than you'd expect, but I still think it's decent.Drinks - Standard beer with a few craft beers and some Texas staples like Shiner Bock.  Good Sunday beer specials for football.  The only cocktail I've tried so far is the bloody mary.  It tastes great, is extra spicy, and doesn't taste like it was poured straight from a mix like so many in hoboken do.Space - The space was designed excellently.  When you walk in you definitely get a feel of a true bbq restaurant, similar to Hill Country.  Thought not super ""Texas authentic,"" it is definitely a step above other bbq spots and was much more than I expected for Hoboken bbq.  The cafeteria style counter is the way to go versus waiter service.  This way you can actually see the meat being cut and add more or less to your liking.  The bar is also a really nice size and there are more than enough tables on the other side of the restaurant.  To appeal to the Sunday football crowd, the addition of a good number of TV's and a projector was pretty key.Service - I will admit that the first time I went the service was a bit slow.  We only ordered drinks through our waiter and went up to the counter for food, but our drinks did take a while.  To make up for it, the waiter gave us a free round.  The 2nd and 3rd times I've been there I had no issues whatsoever with the service.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I can't help but laugh when people say, ""It's no Texas BBQ so it sucks."" You're right, it's not Texas, it's Hoboken, the home of mediocre brunch spots, subpar bars with even more subpar bar food, etc. So, yes, it's not Texas BBQ, but it's a nice option to have around. Had the brisket and short ribs as well as the corn pudding, corn salad, and mac & cheese. Overall the food could use a bit more flavor, but their sauces do the trick. The meats were pretty solid. Would've loved more rub of some sort, but still satisfying. The corn pudding was a nice substitute for corn bread (kind of). The corn salad was also good - could've used something else extra. The mac & cheese on the other hand leaves something to be desired. I didn't exactly taste any cheese. Thought it was more of a mac & heavy cream, or something creamy, but definitely no cheese flavor.A friend had the margarita in a mason jar (full of ice) for $13, pricey for sure. Also had two desserts - the peach cobbler & ice cream + pecan pie. Both were also good, nothing mind blowing. Portions were on the smaller side for $6. That said, for 4 people between 2 lbs of meat, 4 sides, 2 desserts, and 4 beverages, our bill was only $95. I personally liked the family style picnic tables, the vibe was cool, the music playing was mostly country, so it fit in with their aesthetic.

The sausage was my favorite, smokey and spicy, the brisket was excellent, although not as flavorful as Clifton's Mighty Quinn's, and very fatty, like half fat, the chicken was moist with a great, barely-there crisp skin, and while everyone else got a better cut, my rib was more a charcoal briquette then a rib, but the little meat it had on it was delicious. My only complaints were about the set up. There was a server, but you had to order and collect your food cafeteria style, and the drinks were out in the open, but were we supposed to order from the server? Who do I tip, do I tip for a cafeteria style set up? We left our whole tip with our server, hoping they split tips. They have two varieties of sauce, both amazing, but they're in identical bottles, so who knows which is which, especially when you're in a group and everything is getting passed around.

I finally stopped in for an early dinner and had a truly terrific experience.  Before I get to the food, I was really impressed with the vibe of the place.  Great location, great staff (so friendly well trained), great city skyline views, loved the communal tables, tons of TVs, validated parking, fair prices, loved it all....totally authentic.I was with a bunch of big eater male friends, so we ordered virtually everything on the menu.  There were no weak points but I'll tell you my personal favorites:* The wings were truly amazing.  And I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur in this area!* The mac and cheese - fantastic.* The Ribs are meaty, and fall of the bone tender.* Deviled eggs - not something I would ordinarily order but one of my buddies insisted.  They were excellent.* Brisket / Chili - one word.....PERFECT.* Corn pudding - if you decide to give this place a try and don't get this, HUGE mistake.  It's the BEST.Not sure if the owner is there all the time but he was when we were there.  He checked in frequently to make sure we were being taken care of and seemed like a genuinely good dude. He really seems to care and is dedicated to making this place a long term success.Bottom line:  Hoboken needed a place like this and I'm thrilled we have it now.  Welcome to the neighborhood!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

And don't get me started with the peach cobbler - if I could marry food, I would marry their peach cobbler. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday afternoon during one of those random north east warm days in January and it wasn't too busy. There was a game on, but nothing crazy that will draw a huge crowd. However, seating and ambiance felt like it was trying to feel southern, but you can't get that mindset when you have the NYC skyline through the windows. Other than that, food was amazing but I'm just really bummed my pulled pork wasn't warm. I would come back to give it another chance, but I'm probably not going for the sandwich route. Just going straight for the meats and maybe 2 orders of peach cobbler this time. Also, found it weird that they put their brisket and pulled pork sandwiches in sesame seed buns. I thought it was going to be a toasty roll, but guess it's not the southern way? Who knows.I'll come back when we have an abnormally warm day again in NYC and make the trip out to Hoboken.

193,lVr8aMbanBJym6xZoC54SA,Kev C.,3.0 star rating,"Mixed review, mostly service issues...Just rolled down there with the fam for some post NYE bbq. The food is good and the build out and scene was done very well and they spared no expense recreating a true Southern BBQ joint. I'll give them props for that. Tons of TV's as well for games and the bar was pretty packed when we came in around 445pm. I would def come back with my buds for a little NFL action. Think of it more of a BBQ Beer Hall as the food as everyone has mentioned is self serve in a fun and casual atmosphere. Thats where I encountered some issues. After getting sat we waited a true 10 minutes for a server, and that was after I got up and asked for one. Did I mention the place was empty? About 6 tables TOTAL. Furthermore, what really ticked me was on the way in (and out!) about 3-4 servers, a busser,  (and the boss, pit master?) see us struggling two get TWO strollers through the door system and not one person helps... Come on!I also think the ordering system is faulty because 99% of the people go up and starting ordering meats but are then told 'I just do sides, meats are down there.' Thats fine, but put up a sign that indicates this as opposed to a generic 'Order Here' sign. In the restaurant / hospitality business, service always come first. Food portions were definitely  small as everyone mentioned but good no nonetheless. It's not cheap, but what is in Hoboken? The brisket and ribs were quite fatty, but the BBQ sauce made up for it and the sides were spot on. PS - Your Yuengling Lager is flat.

Built out a great space. Great outdoor seating (magical views of the Hudson and NYC's skyline), a great live music layout, a great interior layout, well designed bar.   First time I met one of the owners (pre-opening), I was skeptical that someone would, or could, do the real (Texas style) 'Que here in Hoboken....but he had all the right answers. I asked how many hours they smoked their brisket... He answered "" 16 to 20 hours depending on the size of the brisket"".      Right answer!  He went on to say that they had hired Michael Rodriguez, the Pitmaster at Austin's renowned ""Salt Lick"" BBQ palace. Mike is a super chef who not only was great at Salt Lick and now at House of 'Que, but competes in the big BBQ cook offs around the country.   So it's the ""Real Deal"".   Great Bar. Try the Spicy Laredo 'Rita.... A knockout Texas margarita with mulled jalapeño. Lots of interesting Southwestern craft cocktails and cool beers.     Like most Texas BBQ places, the emphasis is on excellent brisket, pork ribs, and house made sausage . But that said, the 1/2 chicken and the wings are terrific. Sides include excellent beans, potato salad, Cole slaw, and even real no kidding collard greens.   And finish off with some authentic Texas pecan pie....Mike's grandmother's recipe. Yum!   Lot's to try here.....   House of 'Que has terrific CW entertainment at night, and also a high tech TVs, especially behind the bar....

It is huge and open and manages to be one of those places that is what you make it. What do I mean by this? Examples: you can stop by for a drink or 5 on a random Sunday afternoon with friends, check. You can come for a casual date for drinks, check. You can come for a more serious date and get dinner, check. You can randomly be craving brisket and walk in and order takeout with your gym clothes on and your yoga mat around your shoulder, check! I may or may not have been guilty of that last one.I love the layout of the restaurant and how they've separated the bar from the dining tables, and how you can even comfortably dine at the bar! Everything I've tried of their food so far, I've loved. So far, I've had the brisket (personal favorite), the corn bread pudding (yum!), and the mac salad (classic). I've heard less enthusiastic reviews of the pulled pork and the mac and cheese from my roommates, but thus far I've yet to have a bad experience.

The space is re-done well with lots of TVs for football watching on a Sunday. In terms of the food the BBQ could have been better. The brisket was dry, the pulled pork is actually chopped and also slightly dry. Pork ribs were very greasy, and sausage was overly garlicky. Mac and cheese was good but served cold. Finally, the chilli was the best thing that we had. Slightly overpriced for ok BBQ. Drink menu has interesting options and decent beer specials for Sunday football. Hopefully as they are open longer the food improves.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque
201,JZJIG5KdsJHITf0i0loGXw,Joe E.,4.0 star rating,"I read the reviews, then took into consideration where House of Que is located, thought about who might come here for dinner and then went there for dinner with a group of 5. We left very happy and very full. We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday and the place was just emptying out from a few birthday parties (so there were a lot of kids in cowboy/girl outfits running around). We got a nice booth along the wall which was much better then having to sit at a picnic table, although the picnic table would have done just fine. After about 5 minutes our waitress came over with water and took our drink order. About 5 minutes later she came back (so far so good). Since half our table was running behind, once they showed up, they got their drinks right away. Our waitress explained the entire menu to us, we wanted to try everything so she suggested we order the; Pitmaster Pit with 1/2 pound of pork shoulder on the side, which she swore it would be more than enough for five. We also ordered; mac-n-cheese, collard greens, corn & beans and coleslaw. About 10 minutes after we ordered, the food was up and at our table. At this point, we all realized that we had been at the restaurant for about 30 minutes and not only had two rounds of drinks, but our food was at the table. I guess some people would consider that a bad thing, but since we were all really hungry, we were pretty happy. Here is the food play-by-play:Sauces- BBQ good, the other one was too sweet (tasted like marshmallows) but everybody else liked it. Cole Slaw- big slices of cabbage/carrots and nice and creamy. Mac-n-Cheese- creamy, a little dry, but that is where the BBQ sauce comes in really well. Collard Greens- take em or leave em....but they tasted pretty good. Still had some of the acidity taste to them. Corn and Black beans- tasted like you should expect corn and black beans. Potato Salad- tasted like you should expect potato salad to taste. The Meats!Now, I know everybody has an opinion on what they feel like BBQ should really taste like, we all know that everybody has had the chance to live in Asheville and Austin or worked in a BBQ shop in high school. Half of us have perfected pulled pork or has a receipt that has been handed down for years....with that being said, if you are planning on eating out you have to take into consideration a lot of aspects to running a BBQ shop in an urban area. Most places that have really good smoked brisket or ribs have been doing this forever! So, it will take some time for a place to get their smoker and meats perfect (or to meat the expectations of every professional home cooker). The brisket and sausage were my favorite, the sausage packed some heat, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. The brisket just fell apart and while it was a little dry, I think if it was too moist I would have never used the BBQ sauce on the table, which I eventually used on everything. The char on the brisket was pretty amazing, not to tough and just enough to give the inside an extra kick. I'm not a rib fan but the rest of the table was and before I knew it they were all gone. I did manage to sneak a little piece and it was a good balance of fat to meat. I did scrape the char off the bone, just because it was there and looked so tasty. The chicken, well, it's smoked chicken so by definition, it's going to be a little dry. Of course I can be wrong (I am sure somebody will say they have had the best smoked chicken and it was really juicy) but the science behind a juicy bird is fat. If you want really juicy smoked chicken,  add more BBQ sauce. Lastly, we had pecan pie and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream...it went quickly. Overall, I would have no problem going back to eat, I am sure they are not going to hit home runs each time, but I think overtime they will get better and the meats are going to be delicious. The only thing that I was really disappointed by was the lack of biscuits and corn bread. I personally think the key to a good southern restaurant is these two compliments, but, I'm not in the restaurant buisness, if I was, I would have biscuits and corn bread.

Yes, the vibes are cool and I would probably consider coming back to have a couple beers with friends buuuut that's about it. Got 2 Texas Palmers to start.... zero alcohol. I didn't even end up drinking mine and my boyfriend got a vodka soda after finishing it in one gulp. Waste of $22.We initially ordered a 1/4 lb of each the brisket (2 slabs) and ribs (about 6) plus sides of slaw and bbq beans for my other half. I was torn about the mac & cheese and when I asked my waitress which she thought about it she was like ehhhhhh its good. Against my better judgement, I ordered them anyway because I felt like it should be good at a bbq spot. Food came out pretty quickly and soon thereafter we were overwhelmed with disappointment. As we took the first couple bites of everything, we were nooooot happy at all. The only item we actually enjoyed were the ribs. With that being said, we were dipping them in their house BBQ sauces, which were much more flavorful than anything else on our tray. The mac and cheese was so gross and mushy, I gave it back and asked for the slaw instead-much better option. Should have stuck with my gut on that one. The brisket was almost 80% fat and that's where all the flavor was. Didn't feel like clogging an artery that night so we barely touched that. Ended up having to order another 1/4 lb of ribs since it was the only thing we liked and didn't want to leave hungry.

They were completely charming and dedicated to making sure every guest that walked in felt welcome. Such sweethearts! Made me like this place even more.The food was awesome. We got the lunch special for $13 with a taste of the ribs, brisket and sausage plus 2 generous sides. The ribs were meaty with a legit bark (a must for any good BBQ). Brisket was super tender. Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. Even the collards were delicious! Everything was so good and the place had such a great vibe that we ordered another round of ribs plus wings. Again, smoky and great portion. Can't end a meal like that without dessert - an enormous chocolate chip cookie served warm and warm peach cobbler. Do not leave without trying both. The design was also worth noticing. Lots of communal tables, huge booths and cafeteria style dining option make this the perfect place for groups. Every detail was perfect for Texas BBQ down to the tin ceilings with stars in the ladies room. Plus the whole place was spotless - no sticky menus, clean floors and it smelled only of good ol' bbq.

Good bar setup, nice bar to drink at/watch games.2. Good seating and TV set up for an event, i.e. Big projector screen set up for NFL championship games yesterday with many other TV's, sound for game and DJ during breaks.Cons:1. The BBQ is terrible here. It's the worst food on  the menu and constantly disappoints.2. The other parts of the menu skimp badly and aren't great either. For instance the Chicken Nachos (Cost $11, plus an additional $3 for meat) I ordered yesterday had noticeably no chicken at all, and was cheesy goup.3. All of the food is overpriced here, on top not being good quality in the first place.4. The service is awful. I hate to kill servers but have been here many times with many servers and I have never had a good experience. Everything you ask for takes very long and is often done incorrectly. Even getting and refilling drinks at your table is a very long waiting game. It's possible that the poor service is reflected up on management, because in most cases there appears like there should be many more waiters/waitresses on staff. I will say, the bartenders are usually great if you are just sitting at the bar. All in all, this is a consistently bad place to come for any type of food and/or sit down service.

Baked beans, Mac and cheese, Cole slaw all have no taste to it. How do you make bland Mac and cheese.. Or bland Cole slaw for that matter? Don't think they even put salt in it. I smothered everything in bbq sauce to get through the meal. Service was incredibly awkward and slow. A lot of the staff seemed to be high when they talk to you..

Some of the best ribs I've had, including at a few BBQ places in Austin that I've been to. Service at the bar was pretty good. The place was quieter than I expected on a Thursday night, but I guess its still relatively new (tough time to open a new BBQ restaurant near winter, I'd think?).The reason for the downgrade in rating is that the ambiance and overall character of the place just seems a bit off given the location. I read that the pitmaster (owner?) is from Austin and cut his teeth at the Salt Lick. So while I get why the place is what it is, It just seems that they tried too hard to plant an authentic Texas BBQ joint on the Hudson river without any thought as to incorporating the the local atmosphere or attitude into the restaurant. It just feels like the Texas BBQ theme is in your face and repeatedly hitting you over the head everywhere you turn. Not a huge fan either of the cafeteria style, when it is otherwise a sit down restaurant with waitress service. Which is it?Long story short - great food, good space, pretty good service. I hope they stick around and do well. The place just feels very confused on what it wants to be.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Arrived at 2:15 and ended up walking out at 3:15 since my table was yet to even receive water, let alone the drinks that we ordered. For some context, this is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant. I'm generally empathetic to servers and front of house staff (used to serve in college), but when we asked where our waters were about 50 minutes in, we were told ""the manager is working on it"", without any apology. We gave it another 10 minutes, but nope. The table next to us also walked out - they had two toddlers and an elderly couple and also didn't receive any water or drinks.

Never got back to us so 45 minutes later we sat at the bar. Well that was a mistake because to get someone to wait on us to longer than running a marathon. We asked 3 waitresses and they all said they would send someone over and they never did. Finally the bartender took our drinks and a waitress came over and said ""oh great you guys are good."" We told her we wanted to order, and our food came fast. The second round of drinks was even more painful, we watched our drinks sit at the bar window for awhile and when she picked them up the beers were warm and flat and there was no vodka in the iced tea.

The atmosphere was perfect for big sporting events and was very laid back. The food was absolutely delicious, although I thought the price of sandwiches were a little too high for Hoboken. They had great drink specials too. The only negative is that once you're seated, your server takes your drink order and then you're asked to stand in line and order your food. Then you come back to your table, finish your meal and the waitress gives you the check. It's difficult to decide a decent tip, when your waitress just brought you drinks and nothing else. My recommendation for the restaurant is to have the waitresses take the order, get the food and bring it back to your table. This way they can get the 20% or more tip they deserve. Otherwise, patrons are just tipping on the drinks. And if you don't order alcohol, then some patrons may only leave the waiter or waitress a very small tip. More so, they should leave a tip jar at the station where you place and pick up your food for those servers as well.  Other than that, great BBQ and an excellent atmosphere!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Saturday night, myself, my girlfriend and our best friend went after we made reservations from their site for 9:15pm. Upon arrival and paying $25 to park, we found that there were parties waiting for there reservations since 8pm. They were not too happy to put it lightly. We asked the hostess to speak with a manager, and we watched her approach several people who all looked over to the several groups waiting to talk to them, passed the buck, and walked away. The hostess also refused to come back and tell us that their management team would talk to us. Eventually, some other people waiting for their tables started flipping out on anyone who worked there, and they ALL told a different story. ""Oh no we aren't overbooked, just busy"", or ""we will seat you within 10 minutes"" and all that BS. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we decided to flag down the next person and told them to get us $25 to pay for the parking we paid to get into this place, and surprisingly she obliged.

244,j1dnDFWsKi13VqQZN6M6dg,Maren N.,1.0 star rating,I only write reviews if I'm either blown away by how good a place is or how terrible it is. This place is pretty terrible. First - I get that it's supposed to be a sports bar but I think the acoustics need adjusting. It is so effing loud I put my hands over my ears and so did everyone in my party and believe me we have been to some loud bars before. I wanted those big headphone they give to kids at concerts. Second - Food. Is. Terrible. I got the brisket and ribs. The brisket I barely had much of it since I had to carve off 3/4 to remove the fat. So after doing what looked like brisket surgery I ended up with teeny tiny bites of actual meat. Same goes with the ribs which were inedible and I tell you I can get through some ribs. Again - most of what is on the bone is pure fat so you have no choice but to pick at the ribs with your fingers to get around it. That I could ALMOST excuse if whatever meat on the bone was good but it isn't. It's really bland. And meat on ribs should fall off but it's dense and on there like glue so you have to use of fork and knife to cut around the fat and try to loosen the meat. After trying to get meat from rib two I gave up. I tried to eat some of the side dishes to fill up but that didn't work either. The Mac n Cheese is dry and bland. Same goes for the cole slaw. It was like I was biting into crunchy nothing. How do you screw those two things up?Third - Service is ok if you can get someone but you do have to go get your food cafeteria style and then you're supposed to tip 20% for a waitress who does nothing. Doesn't take your order or bring your food so with a party of 7 people she gets a huge tip for doing nothing. And then when we asked her to charge credit cards she overcharged our table by over $100. Fourth - WAY too much money for such terrible food. So in the end we went somewhere else for more drinks and ordered more food since everyone at our table couldn't finish their meal at Que. NO ONE should leave a BBQ joint hungry. I've had better BBQ at gas stations. Will never go back.,House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I had the brisket which was just okay, the slaw which needed more vinegar, and the beans which were eh. The mac n cheese was really bad--it was almost soapy. One of the sauces was really good to dip in, but I'm not about to give an extra star for a condiment. I would like to come hang out here and drink (dueling piano's on Saturdays sounds awesome), but $7 for a Shiner Bock is crazy (Shiner:Texas what Yuengling:PA). With the amount of lunch options in the downtown area, I won't be going back for that. Two of us spent $40+ on two lunch ""specials"" and a beer each. I wasn't expecting Franklin BBQ, but I was hoping it would be better than some of the NYC places (Hill Country, RUB). Hearing that the pit master came from the Salt Lick, I just expected better, and it wasn't even close to the good Texas BBQ I've had (Salt Lick, Kreitz Market, Smitty's, Pecan Lodge).

I have also been to the BBQ capital of the world, Austin Texas, and thought it would be tough to beat. Our group of 4 went on a Sunday for dinner with no reservation. We were told there was a 45 min wait, and I was nervous as reviews said it could me much longer. Pleasantly surprised when our table was ready in 20 min. Downside - 6pm and bar was out of first 3 beers I asked for that were on tap. Our waitress was nice and helpful, we got the 4 person combo deal. The brisket and ribs were my favorite, flavorful and full of meat. the sausage was my least favorite and dry. The chicken was above average. We got 4 sides - Mac and cheese which was bland and missing a flavor, bbq beans which were very disappointing - very runny and no taste, also needed a little flavor or smokiness on them. The chili was average, nothing overly impressive. Our favorite was the corn pudding and would highly recommend.Overall, service was slow but the food made up for it. Not as good as real Texas BBQ but a close second. Definitely the best you are going to get. Ambiance was cool and had ample outdoor seating. Bonus - if you park in parking garage and give them your coupon, you get free parking. I'd come back again.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque
268,JTiOqEKExAqIfaaZ46-T7w,Ciara R.,3.0 star rating,"This place is still new, so they may just need some time to work out the kinks. Let me start by saying their customer service was AMAZING, I forgot our waiter's name (tall, black guy) but he was super nice and very helpful. The ambience of this place is pretty nice too, they did a great job making it feel like you're in a backyard. There's a bar along the border that you can sit at while still being outside, with the view of the water and NYC it almost has a Miami beach feel. It also looks like they have a cover band every Friday and dueling pianos on Saturday. I'm not a big country fan but you can check their website for more deets.So, on to why I only gave 3 stars. There are 2 ways you can order here (as our waiter informed us). At the table with your waiter or cafeteria style, where you walk up, choose and carry it back to your table. I was with a group of 5 for lunch, a few of us knew what we wanted already so we ordered with the waiter. The rest walked up to get a better look at what they had to offer and ended up choosing it there. Our ordered food took an additional 20 minutes! I was really disappointed because it comes from the exact same place and it wasn't crowded at all. It just put kind of a damper on my experience. If you ever come here, just go grab the food yourself. I personally think it should all be served this way, as I've been to BBQ places that just offer self service. In addition, the food was cold. Everyone's meat was cold. I'm not the type of diner who needs my food piping hot, but I don't expect it to be cooler than room temperature.I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich, nothing to write home about but the tangy BBQ sauce they offer is pretty good. I had a side of corn pudding which essentially is cornbread with pieces of corn in it, and it was really tasty. Other people at my table had the Chopped BBQ sandwich and they enjoyed it. Overall, I'd come back. I loved the ambience, service and the food was decent. They offer comment cards at the end of the experience to get your feedback, which is a great practice. I wish this place much success.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

The tin roof, red and white colored booths and other normal-looking tables. The restaurant does serve up the country barbecue ambiance. The food is quite good! The brisket is savory and the ribs are fall off the bone delectable. They have sides like collard greens, barbecue beans, Mac and cheese, brisket chili and corn pudding (I can eat that over and over again) The food is very good and the cocktail I had was very tasty. If you want a cocktail with a kick, try the Spicy Laredo Rita.Since they are I'm sure feeling out the clientele, they serve cafeteria style. HOWEVER, it's a clever move, because you can go up the counter and order as little food or as much food as you want by weight. I ordered 1 rib, a quarter pound of pulled pork, brisket and pulled beef, a medium size collard greens and corn pudding and I was stuffed to the gills!

284,Z0UrutyFdIVGSuVPK1IRPA,M T.,5.0 star rating,"Finally, proper barbecue in Hoboken! Absolutely loved the interior which caters to all tastes, either you can sit at the bar, nest in some of the leather banquettes, sit on the 4 seater regular tables or on the benches. TV's all over the place and you can either order at your table or go authentic Texan and 'walk the line'. First time there so we over-ordered of course (everything bar the chicken!), the sausage was a bit meh and I think that's because of the shape meaning a little overcooked at the ends but the spice was fantastic, I prefer my ribs almost fall off so although they were succulent with just enough fat, I almost balk at having to use teeth but that's me being picky. We got their pretty early so had one of the first cuts off the brisket which was divine with a great smoke ring. The pulled pork gives me an excuse to use their fantastic sauces. Sides (we had slaw, tater salad, collard greens) were outstanding...and of course they serve Shiner! Had a chat with the chef (Mike, ex-Salt Lick for 10 years, so he's had some practice) on the way out, very approachable and humble guy, our server Winston was also very helpful It's tough opening a restaurant in Hoboken, we do hope this one makes and we'll do our best to keep the register going.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Nearly everything is delicious. Ribs. Brisket. Chicken. Sausage. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sides were great with my only negative for collard greens. Really like the mac & cheese and the beans. 2. Indoor seating is plentiful. Great outside seating. 3. Good service with very nice staff. I was walking my dog, wanted to eat outside. I can't bring my dog inside, so a waitress offered to watch my dog while I ordered for 3 minutes and I sat outside with him while I ate. Tell me, how many restaurants would do that? Not many. 4. Quick delivery: Ordered at 5:20pm delivered by 5:38pm on New Years Day. 18 minutes on a holiday!!The Bad:1. It's not cheap. I have no problem paying higher prices for good food. Many reviewers compare this to other BBQ joints in Manhattan which isn't fair - I don't want to travel into Manhattan to get BBQ so I will gladly pay the extra cost of having a good, not great BBQ joint here. 2. They need to fix the drink and food order process. It seems silly if you want soda and you need a waitress to serve it to you. That should be manually done. If you need a beer or alcohol, then waitress is needed. But every time I go in, it's a solid 5-10 minute process to get a seat, waitress, order soda then get up, order food, sit down, wait for soda while the food is there, then wait for a check for your $2 soda, pay and leave. Easy fix is simply have a system to order drinks like when you walk in you get a flag on a stand. Want a drink or the check, put up the flag. Waitress then knows you need service. If you are someone, like me who just wants to get in and out, with no fuss - you should be able to get in line, order food and a non-alcoholic beverage, sit down, eat and get out without a hassle. Right now, it's a hassle. 3. The lunch menu special portions are ridiculously small. For $17 it was like 3 bites of mac & cheese, 3 fork-full bites of beans and a small noshing of meats. I left hungry. Maybe add in a $5 super size option? I'll pay it! I almost should have just ordered two lunches for myself. Bottom line is it get 4 out of 5 stars.

Food is good and simple. The staff is nice and friendly, but service is a bit lousy. It's not even that busy and it takes forever to get a staff member to assist.  We had to get up to speak to the waitress about ordering fries, we ordered them, they never arrived, but they were included in the tab.

297,fascMKGCG_Qrl5HLwXHHiA,Jeff K.,1.0 star rating,"It was interesting to see so many bifurcated reviews on this place - I can safely say the negative reviews are deserved. Considered giving it 2 stars just for convenience in Hoboken and waterfront location but ultimately couldn't.The place is a messy array of tables, benches, and chairs - strangely none of it matches and more importantly the layout was entirely awkward. I ended up being sitting in the middle of an isle constantly getting bumped into. Some tables are blocked by columns, others simply should be removed. Service is slow to take orders (though food comes out quick being premade), the hostess was not at her station as we walked in. Seems like several employees just sitting around as we scanned the place to get someone's attention.Ordering food is a task in and of itself given the meats are sold by the pound and ultimately overpriced for what comes out of the kitchen. 1/2 lb of ribs yielded only 3 ribs total but the server said is enough for one person, thus a full lb would have been 6 ribs and well short of a rack for $16. I was surprised the restaurant did not round up for our table of two as to not give us an odd number. A lb of wings yielded about 9-10 wings for $12. 1/2 brisket portion seemed on point given no bones, but would be helpful if servers gave a little better guidance. They should really portion out food in single orders, with the option to order by the pound for large groups (probably more profitable as it is currently). So on to the food:Brisket - tender, but come fairly flavorless. Have to add your own bbq sauce - only two to choose from.Ribs - decent, but lack any sort of rub to make them tasty. Moist but not fall of they bone. NOTE: They only have one type of pork rib which is very disappointing. Most places have memphis dry rub and st louis style at least. Very disappointing to see no beef rib on the menu, but I doubt they would do a good job with that anyways.Wings - chipotle bbq - crispy under, but drenched in sauce. Sadly, probably best thing we tried in terms of taste.Mac & Cheese - HORRENDOUS. Bland, overcooked. Probably the worst I've ever had at a restaurant. Slaw - pretty generic, but met expectations.Cocktails at $11 are overpriced and light on alcohol. Overall I was very disappointed on food, price, and service. Would recommend Smoking Barrel over this place if you are looking for BBQ in hoboken.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque
298,8dbhIn1LtB11HeYfzOk-kg,Steven S.,5.0 star rating,"Based on what I'd read and seen about House of 'Que before I went there last Saturday night (February 27, 2016), my expectations were high. I'm a pretty tough critic, and I have to say that House of 'Que exceeded my expectations. We will be back for sure.From the moment my party of four walked in we knew we were in four a great time. The place was packed, but we never felt crowded. The vibe was just right--House of 'Que tells you this is the kind of joint you want to spend an entire evening eating (lots), drinking (of course), watching, listening (we were there for the very fun Dueling Pianos), and hanging. I'm always in search of what I call being in the moment, and House of 'Que delivers in a big way.Food: Simply put, this is real-deal barbecue. The four of us had the Pitmaster's deal--$72 for a fantastic, abundant mix of ribs, brisket, sausage, and chicken with four tasty sides. You taste the smoke on the succulent meats (they use hickory, oak, and cherry, I think) but it is by no means overwhelming. The two sauces (a ketchup-based one and a vinegar-based one) were just right: They didn't overwhelm the meat at all. We got to meet Mike Rodriguez, who was pitmaster at the famous Salt Lick outside Austin, Texas. This guy knows barbecue and he and his crew serve up righteous stuff. The wings and nachos starters were also top-notch. Details matter to me, so I appreciated the really good chips--not at all greasy, these chips were light and crispy, the perfect foil to the rich toppings.We ended up with a to-go box with two big slices of brisket, a whole chicken leg, and a link of sausage. My wife devoured some of the leftovers the next day.By the way, consider going cafeteria style for your main meal. You can go up and tell the guys which cuts you want. (The owner brought us a special treat of some burnt ends--unreal flavor, which comes from doing the BBQ right.)Drinks: Gotta have drinks with this food. This is no chi-chi speakeasy. Just a solid bar with enough good beer choices and a really good cocktail menu with drinks that are just right for this food. The bar area was rocking when we went but I was able to grab myself a beer without any wait at the bar (after enjoying an interesting twist on a Mojito and another nice fruity drink).Ambience: As I said above, this plays makes you want to hang out. The decor isn't some cheesy, fake Texas roadhouse wannabe. Even though it's right on the Hudson overlooking Manhattan once you step inside you could be in some Texas honky tonk--it just feels right. The owner has clearly taken a lot of care in using reclaimed materials and lots of other cool stuff. There's a lot to look at and appreciate (beyond the attractive women who were there) if you're into that kind of thing. Don't forget to check out the view (especially as the weather gets warmer). House of 'Que is right on the waterfront, so after a satisfying meal you'll want to take a stroll. Who knows? Maybe you'll build up an appetite and grab something to go from the restaurant. Your family will thank you.Don't miss this place. Rally a big group of friends, clear your schedules (and put down your devices), and settle in for an awesome night of fine food and fun.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

301,lR04a6HM-HLMxF1eF4hx4w,Kara D.,2.0 star rating,"Ive visited House of 'Que twice.  The first time with my little family of four, and the second time with my extended family of twelve.  I really wanted to love it both times, but it's just ""meh"".  I think part of the problem was that we had the same waitress twice, and she's pretty awful.  Both times we waited a really long time for her to come to the table, for drinks and for our food.  On our first visit, the food was pretty decent.  We liked the variety.  On this second visit, much of our group decided to order a special that was listed on the board outdoors, but were told that it was not available after 3:00.  Really the board should NOT have been up if that was the case.  Three of us ended up getting burgers.  No one ever asked what temp we wanted the meat done, and when a member of our party asked for baked beans instead of fries the waitress said ""no substitutions"". There was pretty much no rhyme or reason for how these burgers came out two had bacon and one was covered in weird runny cheese sauce, no one requested any of this...and my mom's food came out a full 20 minutes after the rest of ours did.  We sat with empty drinks for more than half of our  two hour experience. When my mom told the waitress we needed refills, she was fed up and a bit nasty.  The waitress got even nastier and never once apologized for the obviously horrendous service nor sent a manager over to apologize.  I really wanted to like this place.  The decor is cute and the location is even better!  Sadly the service is pretty terrible and the food is hit or miss.  Some recommendations: 1)Throw some cornbread on the table when people sit down (even Boston market has this ""luxury"")! Then people won't notice it takes 90 years for the waitress to come back.2) Hire a food runner.  Both times I've noticed the manager running food.  He'd have more time to help customers and monitor tables if he wasn't picking up the slack for the craptastic waitress.3) If your special board is out, offer whatever is on it.  If not, put it away.4)  With that, it makes no sense that the pick three items special isn't a normal menu item.  There should also just be a single side choice to go with all sandwiches. It shouldn't be a big deal if someone wants to trade out french fries, just up charge a replacement.  I don't know, maybe Gordon Ramsay should just take this place over.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

307,hGeyxhm7cjMx-zMEhQvdJA,Jason S.,3.0 star rating,"Been here twice since it opened. First time was a week after it first opened. Pretty meh experience. Ordered both the brisket and the ribs. Brisket was really dry, the rib was solid. We actually had to wait 15 minutes until the ribs completed cooking before getting them, which disrupted the flow of the meal.Went here a week after and had a better experience. Ribs were definitely much better and I thought the mac and cheese were solid. Enjoy the sauces too.The sangria was ""okay"". Not very strong at all and the pitcher wasn't very big. Also pretty expensive at $40 a pitcher.I think they need to fix the whole ""ordering twice"" process. At the table, you can only order drinks with a waitress while you then go up to order food. I'm fine going up, but it makes paying and gratuity very confusing. I think it'd be a lot easier if you order drinks at the bar and then get up to order food.

The atmosphere is cool you can tell they really put a lot of time and energy into the feel of this place.Service: given the unusual set up of this restaurant with the self serve vs table service option one would think your waitress upon arrival would ask if you had dined there before and if not explain how it works. It also would be nice to have the sauce options on the table explained or at least properly labeled.The food: I have been unable to eat dairy for months and was majorly craving some amazing Mac n cheese...this was by far the most disappointing of all, a bland flavorless Mac n cheese with a basic béchamel heavy on the nutmeg and not much else, I stopped eating it after a couple of bites since it just wasn't worth the calories. The pulled pork sandwich was ok but nothing great, not much flavor with a dry bun, brisket sandwich was a bit better but not by much.

Given that he said he only has to go to Jersey City just a few miles away I figured ""how long could it take"". At 8:18, I called the restaurant and was put on hold. While on hold, I was hung up on and never called back. Finally several minutes later I received my food.

When I went there for the first time, I thought their service is not great because they just opened and the employees had not been properly educated. Nope. Their service is just awful. When I went there during the college basketball game night, it was crowded. It was expected so I was ok. The problem was I kept calling their restaurant before going to the restaurant and one guy would keep transferring me but reservation desk never answered or got disconnected right away. I thought that was very weird but since my in-laws came over that night, we went to the restaurant anyway. They said waiting time will be around 30 minutes or more. We waited. There were a lot of tables open but they wouldn't sit anybody saying there's reservation. We waited there for more than 50 min, nothing gets progressed and tables were still very open, not occupied. Everyone was getting upset because there were so many spots but they wouldn't be able to sit. Everything seemed very unorganized. And we said we were going to just do take-out. We were there for the take-out order. We ordered 2 pounds of chicken wings. They said it will be right out. We waited. It didn't come out. I asked and they would say wait for 3 minutes. And nothing came out. We waited 5 min and I asked again. They said it will come out soon. It took 20 minutes for wings to come out. They should've let us know how long it was gonna take for the wings. If they did say it takes 20 min when other food is ready, we wouldn't have ordered the wings. I asked for white bread 4 times (since they looked confused) . I came home and there were NO white bread in the bag. I asked to put more wet napkins in the bag. They didn't.

The hostess as seating people, clearing and cleaning tables. We got seated at a large picnic table. Pretty cool. I am confused as to what style they want the resturant to be. They have self service for some people, loud music bar area other end, middle section has kitchen & then dining area with mix of booths and picnic tables. Anyway, our picnic table was near the register & front door. The trolley had about 12 metal trays, plates, unwashed cutlery & it looked a mess. The floor had food on it around the resturant & I noticed a man with a family across from us take his foot and kick/ move food that was on ground under his table. Our waitress was so run off her feet she didn't get to us to take drinks so the hostess gave us a sheet to fill out to bring up to order ourselves in self service. I did - it was quick. Great. The pulled pork wad little dry,the ribs were amazing!! The beans could have been more texas & less gravity - was not thick but soupy! Another girl started work and she helped out massively. She cleared the unwashed area on the trolley,  she gave us our drinks & cutlery. My husband ordered a cocktail & it was 12 dollars for the SMALLEST jam jar of a drink!! Robbery! Then Our waitress then asked what did we get from the self servuce. I told her the sheet infilled out was up at the kitchen register as we were over half way fibished eating. She just starting looking at our meal & asking questions.. was bizarre. Why fill out sheet? Thought then there must not be communication between the sections. Looking around again - some tables were complaining they wanted to pay cheque and one of the bus boys said it to the waitresses & was apologizing to the table. Just felt it was a frantic experience. I didn't relax one bit! We asked for cheque. The waitress gave it & apologized for the lack of service & frantic atmostphere & said she hopes we come bac! That would be a no! There are nicer places to eat in hoboken!",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I mean zero carbonation, basically beer flavored water.  The other guy comes back and we tell him the beer is completely flat, he apologizes and gets us two different beers, and says ""I'm very sorry, these beers are on me.""  Very nice of him, however those beers were flat too, so something is clearly wrong with their entire tap.  Food arrives and we are starving so we dive in.  Doesn't take us long to realize this is literally the worst brisket either of us have ever had.  It was WAY over cooked, (wouldn't be surprised if it was days old and ""resmoked"").  It tasted more like dry corn beef with a smokey flavor than BBQ Brisket.  We eat it anyway cause we were starving.  The sauces they had helped a little, but even they were bland.  Moving on to the sides, it's really hard to mess up simple things like mac and cheese and cole slaw, and although neither was terrible they were not very good at all.  The Mac and cheese was very blah, I could have made a better mac and cheese at home in 15 mins using 3 ingredients. The cole slaw was clearly a prepackaged mix that had zero flavor to it at all and was overly watery. We aren't the type to complain so we get our check and notice the 2 flat beers that we're ""on me"" as the guy told us, we were indeed charged for...whatever.  We pay the bill and leave and realize if we had spent 15 mins to take the path into the city we could have not wasted our time and money on such a disappointing experience.  Bad restaurants don't last long in prime locations here in hoboken and this is one of the worst I've seen in a while.  Don't waste your time.  I have had amazing BBQ in the city, just take the extra time to go there.  This is crap and anyone who is rating this place well or saying this is actually good BBQ doesn't know what the hell they are talking about.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

It was already too loud so they say me in the restaurant. After waiting for 10 minutes and having 4 servers walk by with no acknowledgement, I decided to take my dollars elsewhere.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

354,bubusM3Glk7FBE1tv5fZ8g,Linda G.,1.0 star rating,"Made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night for 7 people to enjoy the dueling pianos. We got seated right away and the two pianists were great. However, we had the worst service we've ever had anywhere, and the food was not good. It took 45 minutes for us to get our first round of drinks, which were brought piecemeal and included two drinks that were wrong. Same with the food. We had four different servers, none of which checked on us and all of which blamed someone else for multiple mistakes. And when we got the food, the pulled pork was fatty and lacking in flavor, same for the brisket and burger. Fries were cold. And other basics were bizarre - one person asked for jalapeños on his burger...and got a whole, uncooked jalapeño on the side with no knife. What? We won't be going back and strongly suggest you don't waste your time or money either.  Five stars for the pianists, and zero for everything else.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Brisket and their special sauce is DELICIOUS-a must try. Also make very good mojitos. Went here for Super Bowl Sunday and the place was packed with a great mixed crowd of mostly people in their mid-20's and early 30's. Would definitely come back!!!

359,2kKWwe7VRCnNHdbTRhm4yQ,Michael M.,3.0 star rating,"Well, I was so excited when this place opened, and the location is great with views across the river. I have lived much of my life in Texas and Georgia and love me some bbq. Unfortunately the food was mediocre and overpriced. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but tasteless - no rub, no seasoning... It did help to sauce them, and the sauces at the table were decent. The beans were bland, coleslaw bland, but the pulled pork sandwich was good, drenched in sauce. For the price, it is not really worth it. I will probably go back to give it another chance, and try the brisket, just to see if it was an off day. And maybe enjoy a beer in the outdoor area. But again, for the prices they charge, the food needs to be much better. I could see going there to have some beers and watch a game on one of the many TVs. I do like the decor.",House of Que,3.5 star rating,$$,Barbeque
