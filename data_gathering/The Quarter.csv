Quarter is a Mediterranean / Turkish place, and it's  obvious that the American brunch selections are here to appease the NYC brunch crowd. The brunch was good, just not amazing. We ordered the bennie and burger, which were on par with any decent brunch place in town. I'm sure their dinner selections are much better - just looking at the photos, I'm wishing I came at a different time.But the service was IMPECCABLE! The waiters were very nice and accommodating. We had our large golden retriever with us, so they sat us in a nice corner where it would be easy to control him and gave him a big bowl of water. We also had ordered biscuits to share but there was an issue with the oven and we were apologetically told that we weren't going to get them. Once the oven was fixed, they brought them to us on the house! So so nice! Will be coming back for the dinner menu, perhaps will be able to upgrade my review to 5 stars.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"

Started with the kale salad that was doused in dressing and had no flavor. Paired it with a glass of red, which I presume they picked off the bottom shelf at the rite aid down the block. Finished the meal off with some unremarkable pasta and meat dish. Low quality food like this does not deserve space in the crowded village. Maybe if you stick to the oysters and vodka sodas here at happy hour in the outside area in the summer, you'll have a better experience. But unless you live around the corner, and can't bring yourself to walk a few extra blocks to spots like Fish or Jeffrey's Grocery for just that same thing, the Quarter is not worth your patronage.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"

The oysters are fresh and huge and $1 each. The. service is gracious and atmosphere is always pleasant and has a lively bar scene. Brunch is great,and outdoors they even provide blankets for cooler days! Just really visited this restaurant this is our favorite go-to restaurant and we dine here 2-3  times every week . The staff is wonderful and accommodating the food is terrific and we especially love the huge briny oysters and the drinks.

The space is very cozy, which we appreciated. Overall, the service was incredibly quick and attentive - our plates were cleared in no time at all, but we never felt rushed. We started with the Beef & Feta Meatballs as an appetizer, which were delicious! So flavorful and tasty (especially the kick in the sauce!) - I wouldn't have minded having these as an entree. They are perfect to be shared between 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are. For my entree, I ordered the Cavatelli Pasta, which was well-seasoned and a huge portion size. My only gripe was that pieces of my pasta were really undercooked, but as a whole it was OK. We also ordered a side of spicy cauliflower to split... for $8, I was expecting more than literally 6 pieces of cauliflower (I kid you not).

The bartender was awkwardly aloof and distant.  He wasn't friendly at all, and made us feel like we were bothering him.  He kept walking away from the bar and into the back room, leaving no one else tending the bar, and us with empty glasses of wine.  When it came time to cash out, he handed back the receipts, but not my debit card.  When I questioned him, he said he gave it to me, but I told him he didn't.  He quickly realized he left it at the register, and indeed did not give it back to me.  That was the first time he cracked a smile and said ""oops my bad"".  I liked the ambiance of the place, but his demeanor alone would not make me feel welcomed back.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"

And for entrees we ordered the crispy pork shank and the signature burger. Can't vouch much for the burger except that it did come with really delicious fries. But the pork shank was impressive in presentation and in taste. Very large portion that came with slaw and dumplings. Best part of the meal was our dessert drinks.

81,kzLby-ot2JSc7Pbe7NPo2w,Wing C.,4.0 star rating,"3.5 stars - another howaboutwe couple food date with my fiance. Signing up, I was expecting this place to be more of a pub. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves seated in a small cozy restaurant where families, college students, West Village locals all regularly dine in. We arrived at 12:30 for our reservation and they had the table already set up for us. Our deal came with 2 grilled brie cheese sandwich and tomato bisque tasting, 2 Quarter Burgers + fries, and 2 wine/beer. Upon seating, our server immediately came over to ask how we would like burgers cooked and what we would like for drinks. After informing our server that we don't drink, he happily allowed for the exchange of a soft drink instead. Soon he quickly brought over our diet cokes which didn't come from the bar! (they were actual cans! - major yay to no flat soda).Our first course tasting took about 20 mins to come out. My fiance was on the fence of shaking. We kept staring back at the open kitchen wondering where our food was which we saw only 3 people were working. However plates and plates seemed to be coming out with no problem. There were about 7 servers busy delivering food to their perspective table - even to tables who were seated after we did. Our server soon noticed we kept looking around, approached us and asked if our first course had been served. When he learned that our food was delayed, he immediately approached the kitchen staff to learn the status. He soon came back to inform us that the soup was being made from scratch and would be served in another 5 mins. Nice touch to keeping us informed and the fact that we didn't have to wave him down to ask ""what sup?""30 mins after being seated, the food finally arrived! The soup was definitely fresh off the stove.  It was much bigger bowl than I expect a tasting to be. The bisque was rich and thicker than I anticipated - there were still clumps of tomatoes within. I found it very satisfying even as a meal by itself. The grilled cheese however was a total disappointment. The cheese had re-solidified while waiting for the soup to be made. Dipping the sandwich into the bisque to warm it back up did not help - now a soggy, rubbery, tasteless mess. Thankfully, the Quarter burgers came out much faster than our first course. Upon first glance,  I noticed the burger had a nice generous serving of good quality meat patty and a layer of caramelized onion and cheddar cheese. It came with a small serving of the hand cut fries + sweet ketchup.  I find myself really enjoyed the burger - the brioche bun was nicely toasted and the smear of sweet ketchup complimented  the hearty meat patty. Although my patty was a little under seasoned, I find it to be juicy and fresh (nothing sweet ketchup + hot sauce couldn't save!) It was not a grease bomb you usually find in other burger places. By the time we finished which was past 2PM, the restaurant was packed and a small crowd had formed waiting for tables. (I guess West Village locals are used to grabbing late brunch?). While leaving, I stopped to take a look at their regular menu - it  didn't seemed too innovative but for an all American restaurant - this is a solid spot serving all the regular classics. With very warm service (our servers came to check on us multiple times and was very accommodating), tasty food -  (just make sure the grilled cheese is warm and toasty!) - Overall a very pleasant brunch experience.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"

It was a very welcomed sight on the Saturday before Mother's Day, when Mama Susie and Papa Stewart were hankering for some brunchables after ambling though the West Village. This is just your quintessential West Village restaurant, the kind of place you'd see girlfriends eating brunch at in some glossy movie or television show. A small outdoor seating area is shaded by curbside trees, and the inside is quite cozy, with wine bottles decorating the walls. The brunch items all looked delicious, and the price was right. I ordered smoked tomato bisque with mini grilled brie sandwiches. Mama ordered the Eggs Benedict, and Papa went for the omelet with goat cheese, onion, and mushrooms. Everything was superb! My soup was thick, smokey, and filling. My dad's omelet was perfectly cooked, with strings of cheese being pulled gorgeously by the fork each time he cut a bite to put into his mouth. My mom's plate was chock full of goodies, loaded with a delicious tomato-onion salad, an English muffin, crispy bacon, and French fries with homemade ketchup. Our plates? CLEARED. We were all satiated members of the Clean Plates Club about an hour later.My one minor complaint? The mini grilled brie sandwiches? They are...MINI. Like...teeny tiny eensy weensy. I'd compare them each to the size of a really large crouton. Too bad, because they were SO good! I'd pay good money to eat one of their grilled brie sandwiches full-sized. Sumptuous, yet small, morsels. All my mom wanted for Mother's Day was a good meal in the city. She got it. She was extremely happy. Thanks for making her day, Quarter! (And mine as well.

Since the menu looked decent (brunch) we thought we would try it out. We sat outside on a hot day and the service was good, but it also wasn't that busy. I got the french toast which was on the small side. The crusts were cut off and made into four standing triangles, which may look nice on a plate, but it didn't fill me up even half way. Even though I want to believe that they use 100% real maple syrup (I can't remember the wording on the menu, but that was my impression), it tasted a lot like maple flavored syrup (thick and corn syrupy). My partner got the quinoa salad, which tasted very good, but again was a small portion. I'm not someone that needs huge portions to keep me satisfied, but brunch is one of those meals that you just want to feel satisfied and intrigued about coming back for another meal.

109,ev7HlimQnjV-Zuo-WKhC0A,Zoe Z.,1.0 star rating,"Worst I've ever been treated at a restaurant in the area. Here are the reasons why.#1 - this French waiter saw my arm and joked ""Sorry ma'am. This is a classy place - we do not allow people with tattoos here.... *long pause*......just kidding!"" then asked me if I get 'tired of people making fun of my tattoos all the time'. I answered this is 2014 and New York City - so no. Then he continued with ""it's nice to see different people in this area sometimes anyway"". Thanks...didn't know I was so ""different"".#2 - It was 1/2 off all bottles of wine that day. As we were looking through the wine list, annoying & quite full of himself French guy comes back and says ""yeah you can order a cheap 20 dollar bottle of wine. But why not splurge, it's Sunday. Order a more expensive one."" I am not sure how or why he would jump to the conclusion that I was going to order the cheapest bottle of wine on the list but I guess that must be my horrible tattoos speaking for me again.#3 - don't know when it happened but we suddenly had a new server who took our order. 20 minutes later came back to say ""wait, did you get your guacamole yet...?"" which we hadn't. And we were wondering too why a bowl of guac would take so long. He was unapologetic, someone finally dropped off the guac prob 10 minutes later. Yes that's a total of 30 minutes to receive a bowl of guacamole.I ordered the salmon, medium-rare. Severely under seasoned, but I did enjoy the bacon and kale.

Another item that I enjoyed was light as Sushi, bay scallops. This could be as a good choice to start your dinner if shared with four. Everything, except scallops, had a very strong flavors and were all rather salty so it should work very well with wines but for non-drinkers, you may ended up drinking a lot of water like us.Scallops ($14) - each scallops (4) came with its shells, with small cube cut tuna and a light lemony sauce worked. It was Japanese friendly dish, fresh seafood, light and clean and gave a same sensation as Sashimi.Tomato bisque ($9) - a good balance of acid, creaminess and sweetness. I think sweetness comes from red bell peppers(?). Two bite size of brie sandwiches gave just enough crunchy texture and cheesiness.Portuguese Fried Calamari ($13) - It came with Thousand Island. Unfortunately, anything fried things do not travel well and it was no different here. The dish was well seasoned and with salty Portuguese sausage, I didn't need TI sauce. Small spicy pickled red peppers mixed in with fried calamari worked well to balance off the greasiness. Foie Gras Fig Newton ($13) - very tiny bite size sandwiches (2 triangle cuts) that was glazed with a marmalade like very sweet thing. I could only enjoy it as a dessert rather than as an appetizer. The sweetness overpowered and killed the taste of the foie gras. I didn't know foie gras was even in a sandwich.Lamb Tacos ($13) - it was very rich. Lamb was mixed in with a strong flavors (BBQ like sauce). I think it would be much balanced tacos if there were more Escabeche De Cebolla, pickled red onions and cut each of two tacos that came and share half with four of your group. I might could appreciate this dish even more.Kale Salad with goat cheese ($13) - 1/4 inch thick goat cheese had a nice grilled mark on one side. When I bit into it, bacon flavor came through strongly and made me smile. I liked that surprise. This salad had many small goodies, some kind of root veggie (I think it was sweet potato?) that were cut in tiny square and red raisins and pine nuts.

We all ordered cocktails and the mini pork tacos to share as an app (which I definitely recommend). For dinner, I got their burger, which was stellar.

We checked out a few menus of places we were considering and selected The Quarter as our spot because the menu and ambiance from the website was the most enticing. We sat outside on a gorgeous Friday afternoon and all tried different things. I was so excited for the tomato bisque with Brie grilled cheese bites to start off my lunch. The soup had a super smokey flavor. I believe ""smoked tomato"" was in the title but this was no joke. I'm not a huge fan of smoked tomatoes so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised but it was too much. I couldn't wait to try the Brie grilled cheese - basically why I ordered the soup - and couldn't eat more than one tiny triangle because each looked and tasted like had been sitting in a vat of melted butter/oil. I am not one to run from a bit of grease, but when you bit into one of these, your mouth was immediately filled with liquid fat - not in a good way.Then my entree arrived - a gorgeous pan seared silver hake over spring vegetable barigoule (fennel, carrot, garlic, zucchini, parsley).  That was the star of the show - the fish was cooked perfectly, the whole dish was piping hot and amazingly seasoned.

Once you know the great taste comes from a combo of short rib and chuck, you could make it at home, but nevertheless, it was good here and perfectly med rare.The other dishes however missed the mark. The pork chop and soft shell crab needed salt and the crispy cauliflower was actually breaded and fried as well as under seasoned. Wine selection is extensive.But the noise level became so high our table of four ended up shouting to each other to be heard.

I think they can configure  the table to fit you, but it will be tight as the restaurant can get pretty crowded.

Service was a tad on the slow side, but the server was so friendly that we almost didn't notice. I did wish they were better about keeping me supplied with water. My glass stayed empty for 5-10 minutes twice. Gotta keep hydrated!Dishes we liked:Smoked tomato bisque - served with mini grilled cheeses. Drooool.Smoked lamb tacos - these were the hit of the night. The smokiness of the lamb and yoghurt plus the salty feta and tangy pickled onion was heavenly.Baja fish tacos - Not as awesome as the lamb tacos, but pretty good. A little on the dry sideGuacamole - Nothing out of the ordinary. Chunky with some heat.Portuguese calamari - We asked for this grilled vs fried. The spicy cherry peppers were awesome.Quarter Burger - REALLY MESSY. Tasty though.Grilled salmon - This was an interesting dish.

My boyfriend and I were searching for a new place to try out and we were in the mood for a nice, hearty burger and some beer to wash it all down. It was also a fairly nice day in New York City so we wanted to eat al fresco. We walked all around West Village and rejected a lot of restaurants before we landed at The Quarter.The host/waiter was great. He let us sit at a four person table, which is surprising because it sometimes it elicits naysay but he was obliging. We ordered the oyster special (which comes with house beer-- Narragansett Lager) and a bottle of Trappistes Rochefort 10. I have never tried the Trappistes beer but I'm so grateful to The Quarter for introducing it to me. The oysters were tasty and they really hit the spot. They were fresh and had that delicious ""sea"" flavor. We had the burgers for our main course and it was REALLY delicious. The brioche buns coupled with seasoned fries and a sweet sauce with the perfectly cooked medium-rare meat really made my meal.

I counted 6 small chunks of avocado (including the ""extra"") and 8 crispy chickpeas in the whole salad. My boyfriend had eggs benedict that he said were fine but the fries were a bit undercooked (too bad because the taste was good). All in all, both our plates were lacking seasoning. The wine was good although really pricey. On top of the food that was clearly less than ""meh"", the service was pretty bad: 2 waiters passed by us when we were waiting to be seated and didn't say a word.

The food is where this place got crushed. Some issues:1. The quantity of food is TINY for what you pay for (e.g. three tacos for $9 are maybe two bites each). 2. The food lacked any flavor. It wasn't even salted properly and its sad when you have to request salt for several dishes. 3. The dessert was just not good.

When we walked in, I asked the guy at the door if they were serving food. He said yes, so we came in. He moved a chair to accommodate the stroller, and we sat down.Someone brought some tap water and then we got nothing else except sideways glances from the staff for 15 minutes until we walked out. The party of 2 got menus, drinks and a food order placed during that stretch. Again, the place was nearly empty, it was 4pm on a holiday weekend, and the baby was asleep.

(totally my idea)  We ordered the cowboy ribeye which came with duck fat fried potatoes (OMG OMG) and a side of creamy béarnaise sauce (I really wanted to pour it all over my body, that's how good it was, but that totally would have been INAPPROPRIATE); we also had the hanger steak; and my dish to share was the short ribs (nothing short of amazing) with mashed potatoes.  I hope my friends don't read this review; I was suppose to cut my short rib into even thirds for sharing, but I may or may not have done so, so as to ensure I had the larger piece.  Shameful, I know.  However, we then partnered our food with The Quarter's amazing wine selection.....and let us not forget dessert!  Bread pudding, banana spring rolls with a cilantro sauce, and a peanut butter and chocolate dessert (whose name I forget, but I can still remember it's deliciousness on my palate).  To end, this was such a great catch up session with my girls, and The Quarter added so much more to the experience.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"

197,rVmDu86GWU_NTKdnKUko2Q,Art G.,2.0 star rating,"""Doggie, doggie--ni-i-ice doggie,"" said the waitress I called, signalled, politely asked for. She was providing a water bowl for some mangey mutt that belonged to the couple behind me on the patio. Was she TOTALLY deaf? ""Waiter!""--but still no response or even the slightest recognition that I was sitting there and that it was the 3rd time I called to her. Her ""problem""? I am pretty sure it was a combination of ""profiling""--single at a two-top, on a somewhat busy evening and plain old nastiness. I had come to try the fish taco special. Ordered a ginger ale to go with it. Even though these laughably small tacos (shouldn't there be a taco standard? Why allow restaurants to call drink coasters ""tacos""?) were as small as they were, I thought there was style and flavor to be had there, and I wanted to order other dishes. I was apparently first served by the host guy, and when he passed by as I was finishing the tacos I asked him for the menu so I could order more. Since he wasn't scouting the area, I figured I should order from one of the waitresses moving back and forth on the patio. The server I targeted for the request heard me. Oh, she heard me. But she decided I wasn't worth her time or trouble--old man, single at a two-top, ordering a cheap special--what could i want that she was interested in? But the point is (Owner Take Note!) that i was 1] a paying customer and 2] I wanted to order more, and I called to this poorly trained waitress four times. The fourth time got my dander up and I spun in my seat, got up and was about to follow her deaf ass into the resturant when the host guy saw me, knew that I had been calling--shouting in the end--for Miss Waxears--and intercepted me. He took my order. The next dish was just okay. I was served my a second young woman who knew how to do her job. But the total tip was cut in half, thanks to Miss Nastypants. Note to owner: train your staff to SERVE EVERYONE! And dump that five-letter word. She was the taller of the two women on the patio on Tuesday, June 16.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"
198,yDplMmHXhh9z1B0tt7bBZQ,Ashley R.,3.0 star rating,This review is for brunch. I think it would be lovely to sit outside here for brunch on a nice day. We were seated inside. I got an omelette. It was good. You don't get a toast choice. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was good. It wasn't outstanding or anything very special. It's casual.,The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"
199,KRHeAcg9YiYB0lOZAKmmXg,Leslie S.,2.0 star rating,"I REALLY wanted to love this place but, sigh, I just couldn't. I had walked by a few months ago I think when they first opened and thought it was adorable, the waitress we spoke to was friendly and I liked the space. I visited last night with a friend that had been before and in his words had "" the best pork chop ever "". Maybe I should have ordered the pork chop. When we walked in around 7 the place was empty except for a few gentlemen at the bar. Granted there was a nor-easterner brewing outside. We sat at a table by the window and for some reason the waitress rubbed me the wrong way from the get go. She was a little bit pushy and just didn't give off a great vibe. We were going to order a bottle of wine so I asked to taste a few selections they served by the glass as well and I wasn't overwhelmed with any of them. She suggested a Malbec in the $50 category. I'm not a HUGE fan of Malbecs as there are A LOT of bad ones out there but my friend, who's birthday celebration it was, tasted it and liked it. To me it was very mediocre. We decided to try a few of the shared plates. The black eyed pea hummus with crispy ham and evoo was OK but a small portion and certainly not worth $8. The Cacik yoghurt, cucumber, dill, lemon and a hint of garlic was average again, and a small portion for $8. We actually had to ask for the bread that went with it. next we ordered the Sojouk Lollipops spiced Turkish beef sausage and here is where the whole price thing was really starting to get to me. Literally this was 5 slices of pepperoni for $8. There was no accompaniment at all and just slices on sticks. Really?? I was a bit off and not feeling this place so I decided to just go with the kale salad for my entree. I love kale but I have no idea what they did to this one. It was a small portion, finely chopped, with squash I think some cranberries and a round of goat cheese on top. It was so overly dressed with what I want to say some kind of duck fat dressing that I couldn't really eat it. I was thinking lite and they were thinking covered in grease, for $14. My friend ordered the Braised Short Rib Of Beef stuffed with foie gras, green apple and golden raisin chutney. The short rib was good, VERY small portion but the mashed potatoes were just OK, $28. Now if you follow my reviews you know I have no problem spending money on good food but I really felt so short changed here. The portions were very small, the flavors not great and very heavy, like they were covering everything in a layer of bacon grease and the service was a bit strange. For a few dips, a salad, 1 entree and a mediocre bottle of wine to be $155 just doesn't seem right to me. Even at 1/2 the cost I think I would have still been disappointed. Sorry Quarter but competition in NYC is WAY too stiff for you to survive how you currently present yourself.",The Quarter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish"
