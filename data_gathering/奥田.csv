You can tell they were made with fresh ingredients and cooked very carefully. They served two handmade deserts, too. I was full but both of them were so good and refreshing! The chef Endo and his assistants explained each meals. It made the dishes even more enjoyable:) The place was cozy and beautifully done. I love their well selected plates and delicate display. I enjoyed total experience of taste and visual:) Very fulfilling! Thank Okuda for the beautiful night before Christmas!!",奥田,4.5 star rating,,Japanese
1,q1P19WvpTXFTmfU7oXgkag,Chester G.,2.0 star rating,"When I heard Chef Toru Okuda was going to open a new restaurant in NYC, I was excited as he is the owner of Ginza Okuda and Ginza Kojyu. But the NYC branch is absolutely a failure... much worse than any other kaiseki restaurants... Please read my reasons as followings:1. All meat and seafood were overcooked, especially the fish soup, and lobster/abalone... dry and hard to swallow. But I found I was wrong until the beef was served... because It was even worse than both 2 dishes I mentioned above! The quality of beef is terrible (not wagyu, just... you know... the cheapest beef you could buy in any supermarkets). There is no exaggeration to say these 2 pieces of beef are the driest and firmest meat I ate in 2017... hard to cut... not mention to eat it...2. The quality of raw dishes were also unbelievably awful. Chutoro's quality is even worse than Sushi Nakazawa's... Maine uni is a disaster to me too... 3. The presentation was a mess. Again, Chutoro Uni Sushi. I believe Endo-san never made the sushi before... Uni fell down, and then chutoro, and rice split apart... unbelievable... Same as beef dish's presentation.4. Waitstaff's service was pretty good honestly but Endo-san disappeared in the second half of 2-hour dining experience... Nobody in front of us... Seems like 7 of us were not well respected...5. The dining pace was uncomfortable. Sometimes we were served with 3 dishes continuously but sometimes we waited 30 minutes for the next dish. And I called for check at least 4 times (around 25 minutes) before I paid and left.6. Cash only... Nobody told me their POS machine didn't work when I made the reservation over the phone or stepped in the restaurant. I had to spend 20 minutes on running to the nearest Chase Bank and withdraw money.Overall, I am disappointed by everything in this new restaurant. More for improvement... in both food, and chef's service and etiquette.",奥田,4.5 star rating,,Japanese

3,NSmWDNSyjqhm1vo7VUxL5w,Jay C.,5.0 star rating,"It is with mixed emotion I write what follows.  I love this place, a piece of what I believe is the essence of the service culture in Japan: any and all customer is God.  In NYC's top restaurants, I am made to feel as if I were a King (that capitalization was premeditated.) But, here I am God served by the truly gracious and self- effacing and ascetic service.  Let me clear: I do not want this place to be ""found"" or widely appreciated-- because then, for my selfish edification, it would suck tryin to get a rezzo.  But alas, it's almost Christmas and I have to be honest: this place is worthy of a very special detour.  Pls see some of the photos I indulgently took, acting like a gen-z at a place I should rather act my age.",奥田,4.5 star rating,,Japanese
4,xM30Cj7zdsTiRQ-zmAFNjw,Victor O.,5.0 star rating,"It was memorable experience. It was hard to make the reservation. We had high expectation because the name. Two hosts with kimono also work as servers. Their English are not the best but acceptable. Two thumbs up for the service. Even the chefs and every staffs greated us to the door when we are leaving.My free tea always refilled (replaced with new glass). Lets talk about foods. We got around 12 to 14 courses, spent around 2 hours time and $190 per person including gratuity, but tax is not included. We experienced plenty things from seafood, shellfish, sashimi, kobe beef, soup, fried, grill, sauteed and more. All foods are served perfectly and great presentation, extremely detail. Some simple and some sound complicated. They care and try the best about allergy as what they did to my wife. What we love: fluke with European salted egg, kobe beef with miso, vegetable soup and uni-toro.What we are ok (expect more): dessert What we don't like: the bill number (i love the paper tho.. They are using Japanese paper for the receipt -unbelivable)",奥田,4.5 star rating,,Japanese
5,fbv2hE02tCljub9JcDSiDw,Cinesina C.,5.0 star rating,"I travel a lot to Japan for work so when I read on Eater that Okuda was going to open here in NYC I had to immediately check it out! I went on their third opening day, Friday night.This restaurant only has 7 seats so trust me if I say it will be impossible to get a resy in the future. It was one of the best meals I've ever had and I eat a lot of omakase / tasting menus in my life... their fish and meats get flown in directly from Japan - a mouthwatering experience! The decor can seem a bit sterile and cold but it's exactly like in Tokyo - authentic! The chef Endo-san and his team prepared an amazing tasting menu and I wouldn't be able to tell you which one was my favorite dish, maybe all the dishes with sea urchin and wagyu beef :)The service was perfect as well and our waitress dresses in a kimono was really good about explaining the dishes as well as what sake to pick.What I loved as well was that the chef spent a lot of time with me and my friend. Not only do you see the chef prepare the dishes in front of your eyes but he also takes the time to explain them in more detail.I cannot wait to go back!",奥田,4.5 star rating,,Japanese
