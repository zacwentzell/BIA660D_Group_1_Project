We didn't have reservations but spent our wait time at The Rusty Knot (just around the corner!). Finally got called to be seated.

My pasta dish was cooked to a perfect al dente with a texture that you can almost only get with good homemade noodle. All the ingredients tasted super fresh and delicious.

My first experience here was almost two years ago, when I stumbled in by accident thinking it was a different place a friend had recommended. After that first time I was hooked! If your looking for guaranteed amazing pasta dishes definitely add this to your list.I came in with a friend on a Thursday evening around 6 PM. We were able to walk in when it was fairly dead, but as time progressed it got more and more busy. If you're planning to come in anytime after 8, I'd play it safe and make a reservation (for parties of 3 or more). Also, it's CASH ONLY. They have an ATM, but make sure to have some on hand just in case.My friend and I started with Cozze (sauteed mussels with white wine and tomato) for the appetizer. A definite must-have if you're into seafood, or mussels in general.For the entree I had the Gnoccchi Di Patate ($14), paired with the house Cabernet ($8). Really well prepared and extremely tasty. If you're on the fence with any of the choices on the menu, this one definitely won't disappoint.Our servers were knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly throughout our entire experience.

CASH ONLY and you can't make reservation for two.We had the spinach gnocchi and al Ragu pasta with the lamb chops. My favorite was definitely the lamb chops, so juicy and tender that I could eat it all night. The pastas were good too but I don't have too much to say about it even though they are customer favorites.

39,qGXcq6uOHyxV78PrFYfWiA,Nicholas C.,4.0 star rating,"Hands down probably one of the best spots for authentic Italian cuisine in the West Village. My first experience here was almost two years ago, when I stumbled in by accident thinking it was a different place a friend had recommended. After that first time I was hooked! If your looking for guaranteed amazing pasta dishes definitely add this to your list.I came in with a friend on a Thursday evening around 6 PM. We were able to walk in when it was fairly dead, but as time progressed it got more and more busy. If you're planning to come in anytime after 8, I'd play it safe and make a reservation (for parties of 3 or more). Also, it's CASH ONLY. They have an ATM, but make sure to have some on hand just in case.My friend and I started with Cozze (sauteed mussels with white wine and tomato) for the appetizer. A definite must-have if you're into seafood, or mussels in general.For the entree I had the Gnoccchi Di Patate ($14), paired with the house Cabernet ($8). Really well prepared and extremely tasty. If you're on the fence with any of the choices on the menu, this one definitely won't disappoint.Our servers were knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly throughout our entire experience. I'll guarantee a great time if you decide to visit!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The space & decor are cozy, the servers are friendly and welcoming, and the place is packed (but not overpacked) with people who are just enjoying their night. I came with a friend from out of town and we were seated by a window in a corner. All night we were treated to jovial renditions of ""Happy Birthday"" as restaurant go-ers were serenaded by their friends and servers. I got the tagliatelle al ragu which was $14 and the perfect portion size. I thought it encapsulated the idea of comfort food perfectly. We also got to start the meal with bread and although it was incredibly flavorful, it was also cold which made it not as good to me. Ultimately, my friend and I both enjoyed our experience here. The only thing we had trouble with was the cash only rule. None of us had cash so I had to run two doors down to an ATM which isn't the worst but it was a trip out in 20 degree weather nonetheless. Malatesta's a great place to catch up but it could also be a great place to take our a potential love interest (the lighting is dim!) and there's a wide selection of wine!

The location is good because its in the corner of the street & not in a crowded street in nyc. They have outside & inside seating. Making a reservation is easy through phone & they don't take credit card payment so you better have cash. For appetizer we got 2 things: grilled octopus & prosciutto and mozarella. The octopus is good, not so soft & not too hard. With octopus it should be the exact timing when cooking this because its not good to undercooked & overcooked it. The taste really matter on how it cook. The mozarella and prosciutto is perfect together and the arugula make it more delicious. For main dish I got the spinach gnocchi- it taste good but overwhelming. I regret getting this. I ate a little of it & didn't feel satisfied. I wanna eat more but its really overwhelming. My bf got sphagetti alla chitarra- basil mozarella with fresh chop tomato. Its good. Not sour & meaty. My bf sis got the salmon with salad and it taste good.

It makes for a very peaceful meal.Prices are typical West Village with your average pasta dish totaling about $14 (pre tax & tip). It's definitely worth the price because the portions are big and of course the quality of food is awesome.

45,klX4IByklVTVsECWMqeRnw,D.J. K.,4.0 star rating,"CASH ONLY!!!My friend suggested we come here for some authentic Italian food. It's a cozy spot hidden on a corner of a quiet street. It's definitely a place free of tourists and for the NYC locals wanting to enjoy some good food and wine. It's also a really good date spot as well, dimly lit but just enough noise from neighboring tables so it doesn't get too awkward. For the food we ordered:Calamari - I was a little sad when it was actually grilled calamari, not fried. I'm from the South, so I'm used to everything being fried. It lacked some flavor, but it was fine. Comes on a bed of arugula and a lemon.Spinach Salad - another misinterpretation..I assumed it would be a refreshing spinach salad, but this is actually sauteed with garlic and white wine. I should probably start reading the menu descriptions...haha. This was okay, but when it's under the Salad menu, I don't think of hot sauteed spinach.Veal Meatballs - so good! definitely recommend. Tagliatelle Ragu - probably my favorite. Pasta and sauce was equally delicious. You could tell that they really emphasize quality.You're not going to find any canned sauces or store bought noodles here.Spinach Gnocchi - I'm not a fan of Gorgonzola (the Gnocchi is drowning in Gorgonzola cream sauce), so obviously this was too much for me to handle.

Poor representation of bruschetta.Calamari - so first of all it's grilled not fried (apparently most of the people at our table didn't know this. It was just fine - it didn't taste like anything but the grill. It needed some serious seasoning and maybe lemon to brighten it up.Salad:Spinaci - I'll be honest this should have been so much better for so many reasons. One it completely lacked salt, it needs some lemon, more of a garlic punch, and most IMPORTANTLY they should have cleaned the spinach. There was sand and grit in it and it kind of gives me that gaggy feeling just thinking about.Funghi Di Prato or Arugula - Super small portion with massive hunks of mushrooms and mozzarella.

They offer a great selection of classic pasta dishes and Italian seafood and meat dishes, and even a selection of wines. Everything was so good on the menu, but I only have so much room in my stomach so today I went with the Spinach Gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce. The gnocchi was so soft it was literally like eating fluffy pasta clouds, and the sauce was this really decadent creamy consistency. A must have when you come here!I once again went classic with my dessert selection and went with the Tiramisu. It was a YUGGE square with generous amounts of cream and liquor.

That being said, this is a very good spot for some light drinks and dinner after a stressful week filled with mediocre food. My friends and I dropped by on a Friday night, expecting the line to be out the door, but surprisingly it wasn't! The best part about Malatesta Trattoria is its intricate appetizers, but don't be fooled: you'll only get one or two bites if you're sharing them with more than 2 people. I found the grilled calamari an interesting take - definitely a healthier choice than fried calamari. Our other appetizer - Crostini Misti - was an assorted plate of prosciutto (I can eat this every day!), mozzarella tomato gorgonzola, and mushrooms. Thoroughly enjoyed my two bites of prosciutto. The pasta was a solid 3.5/5. I ordered something other than ravioli and penne for once. I don't know if that was the best choice because my Tagliatelle Al Ragu was not well cooked. The tagliatelle was very clumped and hard. If it weren't for the awesome tomato sauce and ground beef, I'd give this a pass. My friend enjoyed her plain ol' spaghetti though.Of course we had dessert at an Italian restaurant. We shared a chocolate mousse, which was really rich and sweet, but still lacked the 'wow' factor. I'd like to get a taste of their tiramisu next time. So the worst part is that this place only accepts cash.

Originally we thought that we would have a long wait, but we were able to get seated within 5-10minutes.  It was about 8pm but given that the weather was just slightly cooler (ie. nicer) than your typical NYC summer night, many people were out and about eating dinner late.  I ordered the spinach gnocchi while my friend ordered the tagliatelle ragu.  We also decided to split an appetizer and she ordered the Piadina Mozarella Pomodoro.Piadina Mozarella Pomodoro: this is basically an Italian quesadilla.  I'm not kidding.  It's actually made with two flour tortillas.  I don't think this was what my friend had in mind but it's no fault of the restaurant by any means.  She wanted a caprese salad instead haha.PROS:- very filling: lots of carb and cheese- good quantity to share: about two to three large sections per person- nice flavor: not too bland, not overly seasonedCONS:- feels like a quesadilla? - unless you are a huge carb eater, this can fill up a small eater pretty quickly.--------Spinach Gnocchi: this is what got the restaurant to four-stars.  PROS:- handmade gnocchi so soft and tender it fell apart in my mouth.- just the right amount of sauce: looks a bit sparse initially but the richness of the cheese and herbs was just enough flavor to evenly coat each gnocchi- heats well in a toaster oven! I actually had to take 3/4 of it back because I was too full from the piadina.CONS:- could use a little garnish of some kind--------Tagliatelle alla RaguPROS:- good quantity- pasta was perfectly al dente...not sure how they managed to do it with fresh made pasta because it's a bit more difficult supposedly- very fresh tasting, almost as if they picked the tomato and basil, blended it and then poured it on top.CONS:- could use a little more ""flavor"". Maybe a little more salt?  If you are going for that spring garden taste, this hits the spot, but for those looking for a slightly more decadent ragu, this may be a little too ""fresh"".  I'd definitely come here again if I was in the West Village area.  It's a really quaint restaurant and easily accessible on the across-town bus.  Only thing is to have cash on you as they do not accept credit cards.  Also, their table house focaccia was pretty tasty.  Outdoor seating is definitely available but a hot commodity on nice weather days.  Service was also on-point.  If our assigned server was busy, another server was more than happy to step in so that we didn't have to wait a long time for any requests.  Super helpful, super polite, super friendly.

We had a reservation for 5p on a Friday night at around 9:00pm, and were pleasantly surprised to be seated even a little on the earlier side.  The seating was very tight, but we noticed that there were a lot of other large groups in the restaurant too which was a great sign. Our waiter had so much energy and was so friendly.  In fact, he was so jazzed about one of the dishes he gave it to us on the house - the piadina.  We were given a fantastic wine recommendation and took down two bottles between the two of us.  I ordered the Gnocchi di Patate for my main and I was not disappointed - easily one of the best gnocchi dishes I have ever had in NYC.

That's a funny name for a lady (or woman? I can't remember) to have""Followed by ""I can't wait to meet you.....jo(e)"" Well we'll, never mind that.... When our party arrived, there seemed to be a mix up on reservations and the hostess said my reservation wasn't updated in the system. She exchanged confused looks with the other service staff but sat us anyways. Food was good and we'll be back to try the other options on the menu, especially interested in the piadinas since we haven't found good ones outside of Italy.Calamari - skip this.

Only downside is that it does get busy (delicious food at reasonable prices does that!), and once a queue started, they rushed us to leave. A stark contrast to our service - we had to flag down the waiter three times before we got a water/bread refill and another waiter twice to get a new fork. No alcohol, but we spent under $20 each.

I'd heard that this one was popular, so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the spinach gnocci and ragu, because of all the hype the two dishes were getting on Yelp. They did a good job at meeting expectations. I, personally, preferred the ragu - the gnocci was a bit too saucy/intense for me after a couple of bites. The restaurant was completely packed, but it was a weekend evening. I'm very tempted to take off a star for the wait though. We didn't make reservations, but the wait was extremely long, even taking that into account. We saw several parties who had arrived after us get seated first. There were times when it seemed like tables were open, but the hostess did not seat us (she wasn't that friendly). If it weren't for the fact that my sister was visiting and that it was too cold to try to find another place to eat, we definitely would have left. The restaurant is pretty small - you have to get quite cozy with your neighbors. Unlucky for us, our neighbors were quite rude. There was no way I was going to be able to get to my seat unless my neighbor scooted her chair in and shifted her table a bit. She was just not having it, and it took a bit of awkward maneuvering to get to my seat (no thanks to the waiter either). But once we finally got settled, the rest of the meal went well. In short, stars for the actual food and prices, but could definitely work on improving the service and wait time.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Everyone has an Italian accent and the decor isn't over the top. It's on a corner and when the weather permits, all the windows are open so you feel like you're dining al fresco. The first time I came I got the spinach gnocchi and it's probably the best gnocchi I've had in NYC. That being said, the sauce is rich and my boyfriend actually had a hard time eating a full dish of it. I didn't have this problem but if you're not a huge Gorgonzola fan, this might not be the dish for you. The second time I came, I had the ravioli in pink sauce which is delicious as well but the spinach gnocchi has my heart. Another wonderful thing about this restaurant - the prices.

We were told that there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine. But then we were made to wait almost an hour with multiple parties  passing us. A table opened but we were told that a better table that was more private was being cleared and that we could sit there. After waiting now for an hour and a half for this ""better table"" they separated the two tables and tried shoving our party of three at a two person table saying that they needed to accommodate for other customers. When we tried explaining what we were promised they immediately shut us down and starting getting very defensive and rude. There was also a gentleman (which is an overstatement) that was constantly yelling at people and pushing them to get out of his way. It was not that crowded that he needed to do that. And once management came over instead of apologizing or compensating he continued to tell us how we were wrong. I work in the service industry and I would be appalled if I was associated with this establishment.

88,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,4.0 star rating,"I've eaten here twice so far and enjoyed both times equally. The first time was almost two years ago on a summer evening, my boyfriend and I got here somewhat early for dinner and were able to get seats outside almost right away. That was quite the rarity and I attribute us getting a table so easily to it still being early for dinner (around 6 pm). I recall we enjoyed it and tried going back once again yet that time the wait was more of a typical one so we decided to eat elsewhere.About a month and a half ago my bf noticed that I needed a date night quite desperately to break up the monotony of work and graduate school. They don't take reservations on weekends for parties smaller than 6 so we came here knowing we could be in for a long wait. We tried to come up with a back up plan but it didn't quite work out. Luckily for us, we didn't have to wait long at all as a table emptied out earlier than the (extremely attractive) hostess expected and we were able to take it but had a limitation of an hour and a half at it. The restaurant is very old school; aside from only accepting cash, their menus are copies of a handwritten one, and the setting itself makes me feel like I'm in a neighborhood spot in Italy. I've noticed that the way people were dressed varied from somewhat casual and to quite dressed up.We ended up ordering bruchetta as an appetizer (tomato, garlic and oregano) which was definitely fresh and quite good. I liked that they had a decent amount of meat free dishes and ended up going with the sphagetti alla chitarra (fresh chopped tomato, basil and mozzarella) while the bf got the tagliatelle al ragu (with tomato sauce, ground beef). While it wasn't the best Italian dish I ever had, it was definitely one of my top few, the bf seemed to like his very much. We also each got a glass of Riesling which was quite good.  The service was extremely professional and our food came very fast, we actually ended up not even using all the allotted time we had for that table. Like some have mentioned, this place had reasonable prices that are more than worth it considering the quality of the food. They even compensate for the fact that they don't offer any complementary bread or starter, like many other Italian restaurants do.

I've only ever gotten pasta here, but mixed it up enough to be able to tell you that everything is AWESOME. When I come here with the lady, we usually split three pastas as our dinner, because the term carbo loading exists for a reason. In fact, I've now been here three times, and let me confirm that the spinach gnocchi (pronounced in a British accent as ""guh-NOTCH-ee"" if you want to sound classy) is one of my favorite pasta dishes in the world. The guhNOTCHee with regular tomato sauce is fantastic too, and so is the spaghetti with all of your favorite parts of a pizza besides the cheese, crust, and toppings (it has tomatoes and olive oil on it, is what I'm saying).We've also gotten some apps before, including the bruschetta (A+), the caprese (B+), and some other Italian words that I totally understand and know how to pronounce, but won't bore you with.Bonus tip: if you want to have a fun phone call, try to reserve a table by calling on a Friday or Saturday night and prepare to scream back and forth at a clearly overwhelmed host/ess who is literally hiding in a corner near the bathroom in an attempt to hear you.

The Spanish gnocchi with sprinkled bits of fresh mozzarella was light, chewy, and flavorful, a must try in my opinion. The chunky tomato sauce that gave life to the gnocchi also adds to the fine touch, leaving you with a balanced experience at the end. This last note sums up  the night as i was extremely pleased with the food, and not to mention the classic tiramisu and creme brûlée that gave the meal a delightful closing touch.

Luckily there were so many people and we had to put our names on the wait list and that was when I realized I needed to run to a bank and get cash ASAP! LOLI came here for a date with my boyfriend; we came around 7PM so it was prime dinner time and therefore we had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table. We were seated outside; their tables and chairs and quite small so I wasn't sitting the most comfortably. Plus, we had to carefully maneuver through the restaurant to get to our tiny table and I clumsily knocked down a glass of water on another couple's table!!! Welp, that was my only downfall of the evening. When we came they gave us a small plate of bread, vinegar and olive oil for the bread, and a tall glass bottle of water. I know it was a really busy Saturday night for them, but we repeatedly had to ask 3 different people to bring us water, which was a little disappointing. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the Spinach Gnocchi ($14.50) and I ordered the Tagliatelle al ragu (tomato sauce with ground beef sauce-$14). Besides the main menu, they also have a ""today specials"" menu but nothing on that menu was of interest to us that day. This restaurants raves about their fresh homemade pasta, which can take a bit of time to make. We waited 30 minutes for food, but when the food came it was just so worth it!!Tagliatelle al Ragu- The pasta was cooked perfectly (al dente!) and the flavors of the meat sauce is to die for!! The sauce was a tomato sauce with ground beef. It was a simple dish, but it just tasted so homey! And you can honestly taste the freshness of the pasta which I really love about the dish. Sprinkle on some Parmesan cheese and you're good to go! The portion of the dish was also just right for the amount that we paid and I was not hungry after I had finished it! Spinach Gnocchi- the gnocchi was cooked in a creamy sauce. Now I'm not a creamy sauce person so I don't exactly love the dish after trying a few bites from my boyfriend's plate but he really liked it! It was creamy and savory in every single bite.

Such a magical night...good food and friends, sitting outside. My only complaint was the slow and disorganized service. We weren't sure who our waiter was as different people came to our table. Took forever to get water and bread and to finally flag down our server to take our order. They brought the bread, but took another 5-10 minutes to bring the olive oil, by then we had just eaten dry bread. That should've been brought out together.

The hostesses are really helpful they definitely have the toughest job at keeping impatient (and hungry) customers happy. We have always had a lovely experience here the staff are main reason we come back.

Toasting the bread and including s little more garlic (perhaps garlic bread bruschetta?) would take it from just being bread with tomato to another levelThe tomato mozzarella plate and the special salad were both delicious and can't complain for $10We got four entrees to share which was a great move. They are all 16-$20 (except the swordfish special that topped out at $26 or $28 and I will have to try next time as it looked great) Little tight with space but made it work- the chicken Milanese was huge and one of the best I've ever had. They were happy to serve it with a side of tomato sauce which was a perfect compliment - the spinach Gorgonzola gnocchi would have been too much as a single entree but was perfect to share- while the meatballs were fantastic, it cost almost as much for five small meatballs in sauce with some bread as it did for the gnocchi and chicken dish. - the spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella was also good but tiny compared to the other twoBasically together they made a great spaghetti and meatball dish but for twice the price of all other entrees. If they're reading, maybe there should be a combined spaghetti and meatballs dish.

I came in a group of 4 on a Tuesday night, and by the time we left the restaurant was packed, so I highly recommend making a reservation if at all possible (think they allow them for 4+). My friends and I ordered the grilled calamari and golden salad (seasonal special) to start. I loved the calamari - simple but tasty. As for the salad, you can't go wrong with (golden) beets and goat cheese. For the main, I had the tagliatelle al ragu which, while delicious, was slightly overcooked. Disappointing considering I've had their rendition at sister restaurant Spaghetti Incident, which was cooked perfectly al dente. After gorging ourselves on pasta, we decided to split an order of the spinach gnocchi as well because there is no moderation when it comes to pasta. Absolutely delicious clouds of fluffiness smothered in a gorgonzola sauce that made me want to lick the plate; however, I'm glad we split this as it was quite heavy, especially on a summer night. To end the meal, we ordered the passionfruit chocolate mousse cake, red velvet cheesecake, and almond berry tart. All were delicious, but the mousse cake was definitely the hit. Wines (we got two bottles) were reasonably priced and delicious - try the rose!The only bump in the night was the service. Over an hour passed between the time we sat down and the time we received our main courses. The waiter was extremely apologetic and explained that there was a surprise inspection(after an hour had passed) , so they had to clean the kitchen. Not the best situation, but I was in good company and the weather was gorgeous, so couldn't complain too much.

One cold winter's night my son and I did just that, and were treated to a gustatory delight: Spinach Gnocchi with a gorgonzola sauce to die for and Ravioli Al Formaggio (cheese ravioli with pink sauce), both cooked to perfection and mouthwateringly delicious.

129,h-qO2oDoFUtpEsbTA7MBsQ,Maya S.,5.0 star rating,"I have been coming to Malatesta since the summer of 2011, when it was still relatively unknown and you could easily get a table at all hours of the day. Throughout the years, this restaurant has become THE restaurant for me and my friends. We have brought significant others, expanded to other groups of friends, brought our families, recommended it when people needed a solid dinner spot, etc. We always come back.Last night was our first visit since July, so it had been quite a long stretch for us and we were excited to get ourselves reacquainted. A group of four of us, we had a reservation at 7:30pm and arrived about 10 minutes early. We were immediately seated and brought our bread and olive oil, and off the bat ordered two carafes. We knew it would be a good night.For appetizers we shared a caprese salad and the cheese ravioli dish. That ravioli is BOMB and we all wanted a few bites so decided to share between the table. Fantastic decision. For our main courses my three friends had the penne arabbiata, the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce and the chicken cutlet. I had my favorite winter Malatesta dish - the bolognese. Every bite was perfect as always, complemented by a ton of wine (we ended up ordering 4 carafes). We decided to get tiramisu for dessert even though we were extremely full, but hey! It's the holidays. As we finished up and asked for the bill, our waiter with whom we had been speaking earlier in the night about how we love Malatesta and come frequently, told us the tiramisu was on the house! Very nice touch and we really appreciated it. But then - after paying and almost ready to stand up - they brought over another carafe and another tiramisu for us to imbibe a litttttle more before we headed out. All told, we were there for about 2 hours and 15 minutes, had 2 appetizers, 4 main courses, 2 desserts and 5 carafes, and our total bill with a very generous tip was $225 between 4 people.Although the cash only policy is still not my favorite, and I forget cash EVERY.

My Spaghetti Alla Chitarra (fresh tomato, basil, mozzarella) included al dente 'ghetti made in house and was a delight. Yes, I ordered a plate of spaghetti - and I'm super happy about it. Other items tasted were the gnocchi in gorgonzola (so rich, in a good way), and the tagliatelle, both pastas made in house and good. The only reason I didn't drop the 5th star is bc I simply need to try a few more items on the menu.

138,hSukDU9nh1Hpb1c9ICTc6w,Katie R.,5.0 star rating,"Easily 5/5 stars and my favorite Italian restaurant in all of NYC. A lot of NYC Italian food is Americanized/not authentic Italian, but Malatesta could easily be located in Italy itself.The ambience is great and the restaurant is pretty small. Located on a corner in Greenwich Village about a block away from the water and West Side Highway. Also very close to Meatpacking District/The High Line. CASH ONLY, so be sure to get some cash before you visit, but if you forget, there is a little bodega around the corner that has an ATM.Most dishes are homemade (in house) and everything is amazing. The bread they serve you at the beginning of your meal is light with a delicious flavor. I usually get the caprese salad as an appetizer, which I highly recommend. The mozzarella is insanely fresh. Unlike some other NYC restaurants that make the dish with balsamic dressing, Malatesta pairs circular bits of mozzarella cheese with pepper, arugula, and tomato with a bit of olive oil. The arugula is consistently fresh and not too bitter, as some arugula is, and this seems to be a popular pick for many dining at the restaurant.As for pasta entrees, I've had both the spaghetti alla chitarra and ravioli. A friend I visited with had gnocchi and loved it. I usually get the spaghetti dish every time I go, but I remember the ravioli was tasty as well. Most (if not all) of the pastas are homemade and made al dente (a traditional Italian style where the pasta is a bit thicker than most). The extra substance makes it even more delicious. The spaghetti alla chitarra is topped with fresh mozzarella and basil and it is so, so, so good. I haven't had anything like it before and the chefs at Malatesta cook the dish so well that the mozzarella is almost to the point of melting in the pasta, but not quite - the perfect texture and substance.I have also tried the chicken cotoletta (chicken cutlet) and I can easily say that it's the best chicken cutlet I've ever had. It comes with arugula and some tomatoes on top of it and it is a decently sized portion. Squeezing some lemon juice (fresh lemon provided w/dish) on top of the chicken adds even more character. Anyone I've visited with who has had this has eaten the entire cutlet without a crumb left on his or her plate.I haven't tasted any of the desserts, but I assume they're just as good as the appetizers. The waitstaff is friendly and the service is generally quick and good. Sometimes the restaurant gets really busy so there can be a long wait, but I believe if you have more than two people in your party, you can make a reservation.Malatesta is reliable and always high quality, excellent food without feeling too pretentious.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

They have outdoor seating as well and the ambience is nice... except you're sitting pretty much back to back or right next to other patrons lol but what can you expect.. this is NY after all and a lot of places here are cramped. My foodventure companions this time were my boyfriend, best friend & brother.My best friend got a glass of rosé and I got a glass of prosecco to start. The menu was handwritten.. which was cute/unique but some of the items were hard to read and the descriptions looked like it was all over the place. For our appetizers, my boyfriend got the mussels and I shared the crostini misti. The misti came with mushrooms, prosciutto+mozzarella, sharp provolone (I think?) and bruschetta. They were all fairly delicious but nothing special. For our entrees, the bestie and I shared the salad on the chef's special, tuna & avocado over frisée. I really liked the dressing on that one but I wouldn't be able to tell ya what kinda dressing it was (it had a citrus-y flavor). The bestie and I had also shared the ravioli with pink pasta. The boyfriend ordered the market fish, which was the cod fillet. The guy loves Italian food but he wasn't too impressed with the fish as I quote, ""I think this was cooked in butter.. but it doesn't have much flavor? Like, they just cooked it in butter and that's it."" It was served with a side of sautéed spinach & potatoes.. which were coated in butter as well. The brother got the ragu bolognese.. the sauce was pretty good but the pasta was undercooked. Once again I quote, ""Eh. I've had better."" I think the bestie & my dishes were the winners since the boys liked it when they tasted it lolOver all, even though the food was just okay, the price was reasonable (spent about $112 + tip), the service was good, (forgot to mention the hostess was able to squeeze out last min reservation in :D), loved the ambience and atmosphere.. would definitely go back if I was in the area again.

Instead this ended up being the best meal of our trip to NY.  Unassuming, small space that would have been cramped if it were busy, but was just right for our Sunday lunch crew at 1pm.  Chewy and flavorful sourdough to begin meal. Moltepuciano wine was reasonably priced and a good complement to our meal. We started with the artichoke salad-flavors were bright and on point. Grilled octopus was simply prepared and delicious. Mains were stars of the show - particularly the ragu tagliatelle and their signature spinach gnocchi. Tiramisu capped off a perfect meal. Cash only but prices very reasonable for the area.

When it comes to Italian restaurants, I have one simple rule: if I can make it better than you then you should go out of business. This place however makes it very clear that pasta of this quality can only come from full-blooded Italians who learned their pasta technique while watching their Nana make dinner after Sunday Mass. This gnocchi is the best dam thing I have eaten all year. I am dead serious. This pasta will make you never want to make your own pasta from a box again.

The spinach gnocchi can't be beat (I've eaten it on 2/3 visits), and most recently, I expanded to eat their tagliatelle ragu, which was excellent (although I still took some gnocchi off Josh K.'s plate). Their tiramisu is served in a huge portion, and is very filling, even when shared between two people. The location itself is far enough off the beaten path that it's fairly quiet, and in the summer, you can sit outside (though it was fairly windy the last time we went when that was possible).

151,VhqEoxG9D6JxyQl_MbdZPw,Farrah A.,5.0 star rating,"I absolutely love the West Village and its quaint candlelit restaurants; so I used Yelp to find an intimate dining spot with patio seating and affordable Italian fare. Malatesta not only offered everything I was looking for, but it absolutely exceeded my expectations. The menu has their standard dishes, along with specials written on the back of the menu. And certain pastas are marked with a star, noting that they are made in house. Their reviews are certainly on point, as most Yelpers mention the tuna avocado salad and grilled calamari salad - what we ordered and shared amongst three people.But what truly won me over - I mean, other than the atmosphere and our friendly server - was my entree. I will forever obsess over Malatesta's house made spinach gnocchi and gorgonzola cream sauce ($16). And I'm not the only one. My dining companions had plate envy; and since I'm a nice gal, I shared.  Know before you go::: They only accept reservations for groups of 4 or more.:: Seating is super tight, so if you prefer more elbow room, leg room, etc., dine elsewhere. :: Order a bottle of their Nero D'avola.

152,488M_ubE3Dv8YKRL7XRo1w,Jocelyn K.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 stars. Cash only. This is a very cozy and cute Italian restaurant. On a Sunday night it was packed to the max with people spilling out the door. They have a very nice hostess. We originally made a reservation for 4 at 7:30pm, but one person could not make it. Usually, the restaurant only allow reservations for 4 and above, but the hostess was very accommodating. We were allowed to keep the table until 8:30pm, but she even extended it to 8:45pm. The waiters are also very cute and Italian.What makes this place 3.5 stars for me is the food was not as great as its popularity seemed to indicate.Piadina Con Prosciutto mozz., ham, mozzarella - This came out as an Italian flatbread wrapped around prosciutto and mozzarella. The piadina is reminiscent of naan. I enjoyed the prosciutto, but it seems like a quesadilla with less filling.Penne All Arrabbiata with tomato sauce, red hot pepper, parsley - The penne had good texture, cooked al dente, but it did remind me slightly of boxed pasta and canned sauce, albeit a little higher end. Nothing is wrong with that. I do really like boxed pasta and canned sauce, it's just I wouldn't pay $11.50 for it. I couldn't really taste the red hot pepper.Tuna and Avocado Salad - This was a very small salad for $13, but it was delicious. I would say best thing we ordered that night. Very light and fresh, not overly dressed.Grilled Calamari, arugula - We ordered this appetizer after finishing the first three dishes we ordered because we were still hungry. I wish we didn't order this appetizer and ordered another pasta or piadina instead. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. In the end, we asked the waiter if there was anything they could do to give it more flavor. The waiter gave us a cup of marinara sauce, which I'm happy he did because I think he gave us sauce that was freshly made. Perfect for dipping the rest of our bread too. I'm sure they used the same sauce for the pasta but the sauce in the cup seemed better somehow.The pastas are still relatively cheap, all under $15. I will have to come back to try their other pastas to really be able to judge better. I did see the table next to us order this delicious looking lamb chop, which after seeing it I am now dying to try.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

154,txbQ8zeoa5g6aTPcvt8Crw,Emma B.,4.0 star rating,"Malatesta is one of my very favorite NYC restaurants. This place is cut and pasted straight from Italy. Their rustic presentation, complete with cardboard menus, small, wooden tables for intimate dining, and various clocks striking different hours, is complemented by an equally rustic menu. The house-made pasta is an absolute must. My favorite dish (pictured) features fresh spaghetti heaped with a simple, bright tomato sauce, fresh basil and chunks of melting mozzarella. Want something more decadent? Try the spinach gnocci in gorgonzola sauce - think little pillows of fluffy deliciousness covered in cheese. Parmasan will be served to you in a chipped coffee cup. The young, thickly accented Italian waitstaff will make the daily specials sound like a love sonnet from their kitchen to your stomach. Pasta isn't their only strongsuit - look out also for top-notch meat and seafood dishes, such  as their Tagilata al Catale and a very recent addition, fresh tuna and avocado salad. For dessert, try the panna cotta or for the less adventurous, the tiramisu.I dock one star only for minor atmospheric discomforts. The seating can at time be uncomfortable and cramped, no air conditioning is provided in the summer time, and they have a tendancy to be fashionably late in opening up for the day. Let me emphasize that all of this is 100% worth the excellent food.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Also, do NOT gps a nearby bank and run a mile for the ATM  (as my boyfriend unfortunately did)- the convenient store next door has an ATM.Against my boyfriend's 3.5 rating, I give this spot an unhesitating 5! Lovely, lovely atmosphere fit for all. It is a 5 minute walk to the Hudson River Park so you can make a reservation and lounge on the grass overlooking the water to pass time (I think reservations are either nonexistent or very limited here). My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday at 6:20 to make a reservation, and there was already groups of people waiting for tables. By the time we returned at 7, there were even more people. So get here early!We ended up getting a table outside - the only bad thing about it was that the table was located right under a 3rd floor apartment's AC unit so I felt drops of condensation fall on my face and shoulders from time to time.Other than that, everything was perfect. The waiters could be a bit brusk and slow to serve, but their charming and authentic Italian accents make up for it. As for the food, we got:Calamari with arugula - only very subtly chewy and delicious. Loved the grilled flavor. Also, hefty amount for an appetizer!Sirloin Steak - Oh my goodness. My boyfriend and I don't even like steak but this was absolutely delicious. The cheese, arugula and steak combination was perfect; a little salty (cheese), a little sweet (steak), and a little sour (balsamic). The portion here was also enormous.Fish of the day - I think the fish we got was Codfish. The flavor wasn't overpowering, but that's what made it so good. It was a melt in your mouth kind of a thing. Would definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

For dinner I definitely recommend one of the homemade pastas, they were the best thing we got for sure. I got the spinach gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream sauce...literally haven't had anything this delicious since I was in Italy! Highly recommend this dish! The boys got the cheese ravioli with a blush sauce, which they also really loved. My other friend got the penne all arrabiatta, which was good but the penne wasn't homemade, and she said ours were better. For dessert we had the tiramisu and a chocolate mousse dish that the waiter recommended, both delicious! Tiramisu was better if I had to choose one. IMPORTANT: it's cash only, so hit the ATM before you go! Totally worth it, I'm craving the food again already! And make a reservation, it's a smaller place. My only less-than-wonderful comment I have is that both red wines we tried (Chianti and Cabernet) were not very good, and we struggled to drink them.

Yes the pasta is homemade which is nice but the flavors were nothing to write home about (best dish was probably the gnocchi) and the portions weren't that large either (6 pieces for the ravioli dish). We also had two carafes of rosé to share.

Smart move on our part because we got to explore the menu and try many things. For starters we had the calamari salad that comes grilled, the tuna avocado salad (which was a special), and the bruschetta. Loved the calamari--the grilling added great flavor. The tuna avocado salad was fresh. For the main event we shared the potato gnocchi, the spaghetti alla chitarra, the steak, and a ravioli special. Everything was amazing--the gnocchi melted in my mouth, the steak was perfectly cooked. The spaghetti was my favorite dish--loved the sauce and the mozzarella was heaven. The ravioli was a hit but sadly I only got to try half of one--my dining group was quick to pounce when the food came out! Our waiter was polite but service got a bit frantic towards the middle of the meal, but this is also when the restaurant was busy.

Our waiter was passionate and honest about what he was recommending. The food was phenomenal. Simple, and delicious. We had the cozze and piandina to share for the table, which were finished in a matter of seconds. I got the spaghetti alla chitarra, and nibbled off neighboring plates of spinach gnocchi, gnocchi di patate, tagliatelle al ragu and portobello salad. Everything was unpretentiously delicious, and at a fair price. If I had to choose favorites, it would be the cozze and the spaghetti. Both were super fresh, and beautifully cooked.

It was also SO hot inside, and we were sat right next to the door so I kept getting bumped. They had overhead fans going but I could not feel them helping at all. Also only one bathroom was working (men's) so there was a long line most of the evening. Food was fantastic overall. Yes, the spinach gnocchi is as good as everyone else is saying, even better. I licked the damn plate. Do yourself a favor and just get it. Great for a casual lunch/dinner between friends. Would in no way recommend coming if you are trying to have a romantic or first date as it is quite loud and consistently busy.Cash only, no reservations if you are less than 4 people.

190,PYcAYNSWS-VxPbAFBI4SQA,Stephanie A.,5.0 star rating,Cute little Italian place. This place is really tiny but it has a nice atmosphere. I tried to call for a reservation but they only take reservations for large parties. They open up at 5:30pm on Saturdays and I arrived about 6:00pm and the place was already filling up very quickly. The space is tight and you will be seated very closely to the people next to you but as New Yorkers we all know that personal space is limited in this city. For apps I had the grilled calamari and the Mozzarella & tomato salad. Both were very fresh. I was not too sure how I would feel about the grilled calamari but I actually really enjoyed it. For my entree I decided to go with the Pink Raviolis which were really delicious it just wasn't enough! I think there may have been a total of 8 on the plate and I was just still hungry and ready to get another order. For dessert I tried the creme brûlée which was magnificent. This is a really cute cozy place in a great area. I would definitely come back here and would highly recommend!,Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

One day I won't feel so guilty to eat a whole plate of this as it is rich and creamy.  The star of this dish is the Gorgonzola sauce so feel free to dip everything you can into the sauce the Gnocchi comes in.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

We came on a Sunday evening sans reservations and were promptly seated in the corner by a window. Ambience was lively but not boisterous, like a great neighborhood scene filled with locals.We shared the grilled calamari, which had just the right amount of char. A fresh squeeze of lemon pleasantly brightened up the smokiness. My tagliatelle al ragu was excellent. When it came out I was worried it was too much, but I couldn't stop eating it. The flavors were so simple and comforting, and the pasta itself was flavorful with a nice firm bite.Husband's lamb chops were flawlessly cooked, and the accompanying potatoes and spinach stood up well next to the meat.

196,1871c3VJYWX3ogK5OgOCcA,Wendy L.,4.0 star rating,"From the outside and immediately upon entering, Malatesta Trattoria transported me back to Italy. Add in  the handwritten menu and you're just in awe of the restaurant's charm. I mean it's not common to see a handwritten menu these days. My friend and I arrived on a late Saturday afternoon and were shocked to see that the restaurant was completely empty. Great for us because that just means no waiting for a table and for our food! Our waiter informed us it's due to the cold and explained how it's insanely packed when the weather is warmer. I had done prior research on what to order, so when you scroll through the pictures and see the spinach gnocchi in every other row, you know you have to try this dish even if you're not a gnocchi/creamy sauce fan. My friend and I did just this, along with ordering the tagliatelle al ragu. The spinach gnocchi was everything I imagined it to be (I'll admit I had some pretty high standards because my only 2 experiences with gnocchi were awful and I'm not a creamy pasta fan). However, the gnocchi had perfect texture where it's not too soft and still has some bite to it, while the sauce was creamy, but not overdosed in cream where it's extremely heavy. I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this dish from the initial to last bite. I even took the bread to soak up the gnocchi sauce! Despite how great this dish was, I highly recommend sharing this dish because it's a fairly large portion, so its magically taste and texture will wear off on you and become one-noted if you just eat this alone. The tagliatelle al ragu was equally as good and held its own as my fork bounced back and forth from the gnocchi and the tagliatelle. There was a generous amount of ragu as well. Service was great and attentive. Our waiter was super personable and chimed into our conversations as well. Definitely would come here now as it's still cold out, so you wouldn't have to wait in line - I'll be back regardless of the weather though!

We arrived at approximately 5:30 pm and left at 6:15 and the place was packed with a wait. So pro tip here - get there early if you can.I ordered the cheese ravioli with a pink sauce and the S.O. ordered spinach gnocchi.  Both were so fresh and amazing. I was craving more of a tomato sauce, so I think mine tasted better. However, his was rich and amazing. I'm glad I read the Yelp reviews before we went because the spinach gnocchi is a hot item.  We also ordered the bruschetta was an appetizer and it tasted amazingly fresh and clean.

199,TDUK7j_XHX1GdNYps8aNNw,Wahed K.,3.0 star rating,"Despite the high reviews of this place, our experience was less than stellar.  I was craving pasta and came here with my wife. They opened for dinner at 5:30 and we were there around 5:40. In about 15 more minutes, the restaurant was pretty much full so there is no doubting their popularity. We got our orders in quickly. I got the tortellini with prosciutto while my wife got the spinach gnocchi. The tortellini was cooked perfectly but the gnocchi was too mushy with absolutely no texture. I am surprised by the high praises the gnocchi has received. Having had perfectly cooked gnocchi just a couple of weeks earlier, this is was a let down. However, the biggest let down in both dishes was the flavor. They were both very one note. We weren't a big fan of the watery, cheese sauce that was in both dishes. The tortellini at least had some fresh basil that complimented the prosciutto but there was no saving the gnocchi.  I agree with the yelpers who have said that Bianca is a better choice. Despite the fair amount of space, most of the tables around the corners are cramped which is par for course in NYC and we didn't have any issues with the service either. We were in and out within 45 minutes which was what we were hoping to do but the pastas didn't inspire us enough to consider returning.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Check the menu before coming because it is quite limited and tastes do vary.  A small menu is perfect for me as long as a lot of the options look appealing and Malatesta's menu is full of appetizing options for me, but again everyone has different preferences.

Caprese was also delicious, a firmer mozz than you normally get, and slightly smaller serving, but great quality tomatoes and cheese. The showstopper is their homemade gnocchi of course. They were fresh, pillow-y and chewy spinach gnocchi, in a thick decadent (but not too overpowering) gorgonzola cream sauce. The waiter offered us extra bread to help mop up the sauce, and it was almost like fondue. They also bring you a little mug of crumbled parmesan cheese and leave it at the table...

No apologies. Service overall was very disappointing, with plenty of staff around but almost impossible to get their attention - they were just standing around in groups chatting and joking.

She mentioned the time that my group had to be up by (2 hours was more than enough) which means people must often want to stay a long time and relax after a great meal.If you're a first timer, I definitely suggest the Spinach Gnocchi. There is just nothing like it. It was melt-in-your-mouth potato-ey pasta goodness. The gorgonzola sauce was heavenly.Service was great, tables were tight but in the nicer weather the restaurant is opened up for outside seating.

The food was excellent. Price was low for the neighborhood. The outdoor seating is perfect for summer nights. The place was bustling! There was a wait for the food to come out, but we didn't mind. The food made up for that!Waiters didn't linger or hover, but you knew they were easy to flag down if you needed to.

It was rainy so the restaurant wasn't packed but they still had all the windows open to enjoy the last few days of summer. The staff were friendly and attentive albeit a tiny bit disorganized. This restaurant is cash only but everything is fairly reasonably priced so you don't need $100s to go for a meal for 2. We tried the tomato gnocchi which my friend described as 'fluffy pillows of heaven' which I agree with although maybe not as descriptively. They also use fresh basil as a garnish and give you a cup of grated Parmesan so you can add as much cheese as you like. You can never have enough cheese!As the months get cooler I'll definitely come back for a comforting bowl of pasta.,Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

We had the bread which is yummy and seasoned, we started with the caprese salad, one time we had a carafe of white wine and another of red, both were reasonably priced and yummy.

Then after being seated, the hostess asked us to try to finish by 8:45 pm to make space for a bigger party coming but kept sitting tables for two next to us... um, okay?Okay so the food... delicious! We scarfed down the bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and started off with the calamari. It was grilled whole and served over arugula. A must have. Our appetizer came out quickly but our food took FOREVER. The two people next to us on what I assume was a first date, asking each other typical first date questions were quite entertaining as we waited for our food. Their awkward silences made me feel awkward. Our food finally came after close to 30 minutes. I had the spinach gnocchi and my date ordered the artichoke ravioli that was on special that night but got the cheese ravioli with the pink sauce by mistake. Since we didn't want to wait even longer my date decided to stick with it.

It turns out he chased after us because he said the tip was too low. I was shocked, having never seen something like this happen before. This is not only insulting, but highly unprofessional. It turns out I had miscalculated the tip and I even would've paid higher -- that was my mistake.

Their popular spinach gnocchi was not too dense and the sauce was not too heavy and creamy.  Both times I ordered the lamb chops, medium rare, because it just melts in your mouth and has an amazing marinade (just a tad sweet).  The tuna salad had a generous amount of perfectly seared tuna with a great dressing (goes very well with the avocado).  The grilled calamari could've used a bit more seasoning but was cooked perfectly.  My knife just went right through the octopus.

Maletesta trattoria is located a couple blocks away from the Christopher street 1 train station and right on the edge of the west side highway. It's a perfect little joint that adds to the charm of the neighborhood.  The menu has a limited number of options, but the items I've tried are all delicious: My favorite has to be the tagliatelle al ragu. The sauce is fresh and not too overwhelmingly salty. There's a bit of a sweet/tangy taste thanks to the generous use of tomatoes. The infamous spinach gnocchi lives up to its reputation of fluffy and pillowy - indications of fresh gnocchi! The sauce of this dish is creamy and flavorful. The basil really brings a good herbal lift to the sauce. The ravioli in pink sauce is as good of a ravioli as any I've ever had. Cooked to a perfect al dente and filled with fresh cheese, every bite was satisfyingly delicious. The pink sauce was more of an orange - most likely a refined marinara Alfredo. I'm really looking forward to coming to this place during the summer when they bring their tables outside!

I was thrilled I got my own cup and assumed my reputation for loving obscene amounts of cheese on my pasta had spread all through Manhattan until they suddenly took the cup away without saying a word - almost as though they assumed I was listening to my friend so much that I wouldn't notice this.  Oh well, I had enough as it was!My pasta was perfect al dente penne with the right amount of sauce but unfortunately, it wasn't the least bit spicy though it did have the slightest kick to remind you that there were indeed peppers hidden in there.  The sauce was light, flavorful and absolutely declicious and my friend's salad was a bit small in portion but the piece of funghi were fairly huge and delicious!After our meal, we sipped water - I support said friend in not needing to drink alcohol at all (not like we need it) - and chatted more.  It then occurred to us once we got the dessert menu that we weren't interested in any of that and we were in fact still hungry.  How could this be, though?  My friend's salad makes sense but my pasta?  Aren't I the one that's supposed to be full?  We played with the idea of splitting an entre but apparently $7 each was too expensive for my friend so I respected that and decided I would just have food when I got home.  I was a bit disappointed but I did remember I had eaten very lightly the entire day so perhaps it wasn't Malatesta it was just me.  As for my Yelp-less friend, I can't speak for her.  Let the record show, by the way I was very happy with the prices and do not find this place expensive in the least (and I'm unemployed at the moment!).Over all, the food, atmosphere and service were all a solid four stars.  I feel as though I will give another rating - most likely five star - when I come back and taste their wine and have a salad plus a different entree and perhaps a desert to have the full experience.  I'm fair like that when I have a good feeling about a certain place.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

As for the food, it was excellent and reasonably priced.  I went with the spaghetti alla chitarra and we shared a few apps at the table.  We went with a house red to drink and I thought it was reasonably priced by New York standards.

I'm normally not the biggest fan of Italian food but figured I'd give it a shot. When my cab first pulled up on the empty, quiet, and dark street, I was worried I wouldn't be able to find it. But then, I saw the dimly lit restaurant with a crowd standing outside of it and knew that it was going to be extremely delicious or overrated.Luckily for us, it was the former. After a 20 minute wait, we were seated and brought bread with olive oil. I then ordered the cavatelli with prosciutto, green peas, and cream sauce and my friend had the spinach gnocchi. Both were delicious! The sauces were perfectly flavored, the pastas perfectly textured, and I loved the green peas with the cavatelli. The one downside is that Malatesta is really loud. Loud like it seemed like my friend and I were shouting at each other the whole time. The tables were also close together. Service was just okay, though all of the waiters are from Italy, which was pretty cool. It's also cash only so make sure to stop by an ATM before you get there.

We were waited on by about 5 different people- 3 of which were very rude. When our food was brought out the waiter watched me clear a spot on the table without even bothering to help. In fact he got so bored of not helping that he handed me a plate to hold in my lap and walked away.  Additionally- the food was very mediocre. The appetizers were okay but it's hard to judge because how to you mess up caprese? Oh and the spinach gnocchi was decent. But the tagliatelle (this is the 2 star part) WAS TERRIBLE. The noodles were past al dente to the point of crunchy. They were clearly cooked in a massive pot and left aside for hours because they were all stuck together in clumps, crunchy undercooked massive clumps of tagliatelle.  Clumpy undercooked pasta breaks all the cardinal rules of Italian restaurants and that's why I give this place 2 stars.

283,IBN-mIgPjZszBUGPEetF7g,Steven H.,2.0 star rating,"Malatesta has become a serious disappointment and it's a crying shame. This restaurant used to be a dependable and nearly authentic option in a city that has terrible, acidic red sauce, bland, overcooked noodles and slight of hand mentality.  Congratulations Malatesta! Aside from the bad sauce and noodles (yours are still ok) you've caught up with the rest and prioritize profit over quality and selfish tricks over customer satisfaction.What excuse can you give for an Italian restaurant (or any, for that matter, but especially Italian) to serve ice old tomatoes in a Caprese Salad and ice cold beets in a Beet, Arugula and Goat Cheese Salad? Inexcusable and pathetic! The Tagliatelle Ragu is still a safe, dependable choice but the Spinach Gnocchi is covered in some sort of salty milk that's supposed to be a Gorgonzola Sauce.  Recommended by the waiter as one of their best dishes, I'm sure it translates as ""most profitable"" for them. It was awful. The bread they serve is dry and salty and tastes like yesterday's scraps.  The biggest disappointment was the wine. A Super Tuscan at $48 tasted like an average $10 bottle from a local, mass produced NY distributor.  It was an insult. It's difficult to send back a wine because it's clearly overpriced when, in fact, it is just drinkable.  It's difficult to disturb a dinner for four and send back a salad when your tomatoes and beets are ice cold because it ruins the flow of the evening.  I'm sure the staff counts on this device and knows just how much they can get away with without cutting into their profit margin.What has NYC come to, when profit matters more than quality and pride in ownership.  At what cost would it be to them to serve a room temperature tomato? At what trouble would it mean to create a more delicious Gorgonzola sauce or offer a wine that is quality and deserves, as well as respects, the $48 price tag! For $48, that Super Tuscan wine should be SUPER! to say the least.Our waiter and I were talking about Puglia and how the south of Italy is taking away tourism from the North Adriatic area in the Marche where he's from and where I lived for a while.  After going to Puglia, I can tell you why.  The people in Puglia still do things the old fashioned way.  They understand quality and they take pride in giving, yes GIVING to people! When you walk into a Pugliese restaurant or hotel or shop you are treated like you matter! When you order off the menu, you are not given the left over fish that needs to be used up by the end of the day and charged twice the price as compared to every other item on the menu.  You are given a quality meal and an experience that you will remember and take with you for a long long time to come.  You experience a moment that will turn into a memory and you know that you matter to them.  NYC, the slight of hand mentality and the disease for profit over quality is overly played out in NYC.  I want to tell Malatesta that a cold tomato and merely drinkable house wine masquerading as something ""Super"" with some salty milk over pasta does not deserve a $200 bill for 4 people. Have some self respect and care about your customers. You have really disappointed me and have become merely a shadow of what you once were. Just as the tourism in the Marche is now going to Puglia, I will seek out another location all together and take my business elsewhere. A word of advice: Quality and people matter.  The profit will come if you remember that!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

It was a cold winter night and I had a long walk from the train station. By the time I got here, I was shivering and couldn't wait to get inside and warm up. During the summer, there is outdoor seating which I presume would be really nice because this area of Manhattan is really nice and chill. However in the winter, they pack everyone into the tiny restaurant. It isn't insanely small but they cram too many tables in for what the space is. Good luck getting to the bathroom if you're in the corner or far away from it. Anyway I digress, let's talk about the insanely amazing food! Omg! I had been drooling for the Ravioli in pink sauce since I saw the reviews and pictures for it here on Yelp. When I got it, it was just as good as I imagined it to be. My only issue is that it is a small portion size. They could've added at least one or two more pieces of ravioli for the price. Nonetheless it was amazing. The staff is very nice and accommodating but I honestly didn't like the vibe of the customers. A little snooty in my opinion. May have been just that night and not typical. They give you bread and olive oil while you wait, and I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio which complimented the food I ordered.

When I practically dragged a hungry friend here after a recent YEE in the Meatpacking District, he complained about the long trudge most of the way, but the walk was worth it. Indeed, Malatesta is the deep bowels of the West Village, but this literally off-the-grid location is not all bad--it seems to be a good form of crowd control.On a Monday night, it was absolutely hopping, the sidewalk seats brimming with summer-dressed throngs of young, attractive people. It's got a bit of SoHo attitude, but the prices are definitely East Village. I had the pasta special, which was linguini with seafood. It was homemade, al dente pasta, just right. My friend had the gnocchi, which was also great (though he was not impressed with the portion size.Were this place closer to home, I might become a regular.

Everything is fresh and prepared with a rustic, homey touch.  Even the decor is comfortable, unpretentious and feels homey, while still being chic in it's Greenwich Village way.It's much bigger than Bianca which is great. They have those huge windows that allow light to enter, and can be opened in the summer, and have outside seating as well. This opens the space up even further. Service is pretty quick and friendly. I had made a reservation and we were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter made good recommendations and was agreeable to swapping a pasta type in a dish for me. The wine list isn't extensive but it's succinct and has your basic Italian wines. I liked this more actually, than a 3 page wine list, it really feels much more homey and relaxed. There are simply choices between varietals and they're crisply and clean, and so well priced (I think a  glass is $6 or something). The pasta is freshly made with a bouncy spring to it, perfectly al dente. The sauces are light but very flavorful and the portions are pretty large. .Definitely get the grilled calamari, it's delicious. It's very simply made but grilled to perfection, and perfectly chewy. We had the tagliatelle two ways, with the ragu which was a bit heavier but no less yummy and with the arriabata sauce, which was a bit spicier but meatless, so it overall was lighter dish. Our cousin got the chicken cutlet which is this huge chunk of lightly breaded pan-seared chicken. It was too much food and we couldn't finish it.

Don't come here expecting some fancypants Italian menu. Reservations are only for parties of 4+, so get here early to grab a seat.The menu is very small with a few specials of the night. They make all their pastas in-house, so you can't go wrong with any option for the most part. If you want something hearty, the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce is the way to go - it's perfectly soft and chewy pillows lovingly wrapped in a decadent, creamy sauce. The gnocchi di patate also had good reviews from my friends, but I think the spinach option is better. If you are more of the al-dente pasta consumer, their tagliatelle al ragu will fit your needs. Not only does it have the perfect bite, it also has the perfect ratio of meat sauce to pasta.If you're not a carb lover, fear not, because their protein entrees are also well executed. The costoletta di pollo (chicken cutlet) was a delightful surprise as the chicken was pounded very thin, fried to a delightful crisp, yet remained tender, juicy, and flavorful.In a nutshell, come here for some solid, good Italian food.

The gnocchi was served in a gorgonzola sauce and had that melt-in-your-mouth goodness to it. I was a little hesitant about the sauce, but it worked so well. Tiramisu - Pretty standard, but still good. I wanted to end my meal with something sweet and this did the job. I also tried the bruschetta and ravioli.

Enjoy unnecessary carbs in every single freaking dish with little taste and a completely singular flavor profile dimension? Then by all means, give this place a try! I'm not even some white girl in yoga pants and ugg boots on a diet-- carbs are GREAT. But when they come in the form of straight up tomato sauce and butter mixed with an almost unseemly amount of noodles and dough nuggets, I can't comfortably wolf them down like I do with all other restaurant dishes that I order. The food is disgustingly plain. It's also almost adorably simple. Like your 8-year old niece decided to whip up a meal after a hard day's work in the sand box. You look at the delightful mess in front of you and can't help but try to eat it because either 1. she's your niece and you damn well better do it. or 2. you just paid $17 for absolute horseshit and feel bad wasting good money for nothing. Oh and the crostinis? That are supposedly loaded with mozzarella and prosciutto? Let me tell you exactly what's on these delightfully boring bites of disappointment. They've got four pieces of bread in all, one's topped with what tastes like canned mushrooms in oil and salt, another is topped with just straight up diced tomato and nothing else. The third is topped with some really really strong cheese that stinks so bad it tastes alcoholic (can't knock this one too much though because I'm sure there are those who love it) and the last is the actual item mentioned in the menu, which is a toasted piece of bread topped with mozzarella and prosciutto. As with the other menu items, it's extremely uncreative and extremely disappointing. Got the spinach gnocchi as the entree. What a disaster. It's just goeey green mush drowning in butter and heavy sauce. You can only eat so much of this but they've easily got 30-35 dough nuggets of this on one big plate. And that's it. Nothing else.I'd feel bad trashing a restaurant this hard except the service was just hilariously bad. You got guys taking cigarette breaks midway through a service. and just complete and utter lack of attention to your needs, even when you're waving your hands. They just look at you and then joke around for 5-10 more minutes before they come take your order. This place is such a joke. And I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone when I see the 4 stars.

344,wYGenFmC1_pjmy5HuXRRRg,Joey I.,4.0 star rating,"Tired of flying to Italy every weekend to get the experience of Italian people talking at you in those mysterious accents and serving you the best damn pasta in the world? Well, I was too, but then I found Malatesta and now my worries are over - to get the same experience, all I have to do is head up to New York, which all things considered is a more realistic day trip. The night started off with some bread. I have a theory with Italian places - if you don't have bread or your bread sucks, you suck (shooting over 70% with this theory so far). Welp, we're off on the right foot so far because the bread was good stuff, but the reason you come here is for the pasta. I was splitting two dishes with the girlfriend, so she chose first and went spinach gnocchi. Great choice. I was at a loss for what to pick for my half until I saw the special - fettuccine with crab meat(!), tomato and basil with some sort of red sauce. We also ordered calamari for an appetizer. Game on. The calamari came out first (as appetizers are wont to do), but since Italians are a squid worshipping society who don't eat calamari [citation needed], it was pretty underwhelming. Mostly it helped pass the time until the pasta came out. I've read some rave reviews on here, but it isn't worth it. Ah well. When the pasta came out, though, the sun broke through the clouds (it was night, even more impressive) and we were met with pure deliciousness. The pasta was the perfect texture, the perfect temperature, the perfect flavor, the perfect everything. Get the spinach gnocchi, and you will instantly regret ever judging Popeye for his destructive addiction to spinach.The only reason this is four stars is because it was a little on the pricey side for pasta, and the portions were a little on the small side.  I didn't leave hungry, but definitely needed some dessert afterwards.All in all, a great experience, better than flying to Italy, and it didn't seem too touristy yet (although once they advertise this review, it probably will be).  Hope to get back some time soon to enjoy it again!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

I feel bad I'm blanking on who helped me arrange the reservation but he not only arranged the reservation, but gave us the best corner table possible, came up and greeted me by name when we arrived, and checked in periodically to make sure we were enjoying our meal.We did. The service was fantastic. The runners/bussers were superb. The manager (who I assume who helped me originally) was just the bomb. I can't believe I haven't been back. My girlfriends and I were all so impressed. Thank you Malatesta. We had the greatest time!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian
350,QkWTNDo4KzulKPahGMiGyg,Andy R.,1.0 star rating,"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. From service to food to everything in-between. Yelp will do you wrong, really wrong, on this one. You just see (if you dare still go).From the get-go, with the first interaction: the hostess was very spacey, and literally acted almost surprised that she needs to find a table. It's hard to explain. It was like a ""wait, what am I doing here?"" look or reaction.Inside is tight and cramped. No space to move. It was two of us, shoved against a window (back right side). The tables were so tight that we had to move ours out for my friend to sit down. No one offered to help get us into the seat. Better yet: the whole time EVERYONE passing behind me was pumping into me and my chair...and yet...get ready...and YET...the waiter half-way through the evening asked me if we could please push the table in more or if I could pull in closer with my chair. SERIOUSLY!?! We were already way against the window and I don't know how closer I can get to the table if my stomach is already touching it. Incredible.Oh yea, and the waiter: he was literally and unquestionably high. High as a kite. The whole staff at that place is like a cool bro-group of surfer dudes. It makes no sense for an Italian restaurant. All wearing tight v-necks and just mozying around all relaxed. Our waiter had no idea what was going on. He asked for our order. Walked away. Came back and asked us to repeat it. After we go our food he not once checked on us. Who in their right mind hired this guy and then who in their (other) right mind keeps this guy around? We tipped under 20% which I RARELY do (under 20% as in closer to 10% because he absolutely was aloof and unaware and just not there in all senses of the word/phrase).The food was deplorable. Wow, as in, just no flavor. At all. We started with the grilled calamari. It tasted like nothing. This is very hard to describe (yet also easy? I mean, nothing is pretty much nothing - so just open your mouth and let some air in...that's the flavor). Better yet, take a rubber band and chew on it so you can get some of that consistency too. Now you've had what I had and you saved yourself $14. A rip-off and a waste. We asked our waiter AND another guy who then came to pick up the plate with more than half of that junk left on it whether there was something wrong with it because it tasted like nothing. We even had asked earlier for a sauce of some type and they said it comes with none. No options provided and clearly no exceptions made. The guy at the end said ""yea, it depends what we get, some of them are naturally more flavorful and some less ... we just throw it on the grill like we get them."" Oh great, I'm pretty sure that's how Wendy's looks at their food prep too. You've reached the big time.I won't waste your time on describing the other food in detail, but we got some special of Black Fettuccine and the Pasta with Ragu - both flavorless. And the pasta comes in this hot gooey messy clump that will repulse you if you don't like to eat a bed of soft mush.Now ready for the punch line? Sit down. CASH ONLY. That's just something that annoys me independent of food or service. We're in 2015 (this might have been excusable in 1995) and you're so damn cheap and stingy (while not even providing pricing that merits the inconvenience for a 'discount' to bypass transaction fees) that you'll only take ancient cash.But hey, this place has a bunch of stars, a line out the door, and doesn't look like that's stopping - so all power to them. Maybe it's me, not them.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

We thought we would have a nostalgic dinner of eating carbs and drinking Italian wine. Someone suggested we check out Malatesta so we decided to give it a shot. We arrived and were promptly seated inside by the hostess. The waiter took our orders and bought us some complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic. Not like I'm ever going to turn that down!I ordered the Spinach Gnocchi with a Gorgonzola cream sauce and man was it good. It tasted like little fluffy pillows of deliciousness dissolving in my mouth. It was quite rich though so I wished I split it with my friends. They ordered the squid ink seafood linguini and the spaghetti. Everything I tasted was delicious! This place is very cozy and intimate. Made me feel like I was transported back to a little trattoria in Italy. Will definitely be coming back again!Cute handwritten menus too! Nice touch :),Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian
353,SCFIH_Q3aIMnWkwYqjcV9Q,John K.,4.0 star rating,"Recently moved to NY and was in search of some worthwhile Italian.  I have to say that Malatesta Trattoria lives up to the hype.  I went for a date on a Saturday night and after reading some insights I figured the wait would be pretty long so we decided on a late dinner around 10 PM.Upon arrive we were greeted by a great host who let us know it should only be about a 30 minute wait and welcomed us to grab a glass of wine while waiting outside.  We did and the wait was only about 10 minutes until we were seated.  The bread with olive oil was good but nothing special. I already knew I would be ordering the Spinach Gnocchi with Gorgonzola. We shared this dish along with the Caprese Salad. Both were delicious and on point.  The Gnocchi is filling and a meal in and of itself for one person.  The best part was the generous portions of wine! As a true Italian I certainly appreciate this.  The house Cab was pretty good too.  Enjoyed the restaurant so much that I actually came back the next day on Sunday for more Gnocchi! My experience on Sunday was just as good and I can say that during non peak hours- Before 7 PM or after 9:30 is your best bet for a non-wait.  Definitely will be back at this restaurant soon and will certainly take my parents here when they visit.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 Star review was the service, although they are very busy so I cannot complain too much.  The service was definitely good when being seated and ordering however after eating and while waiting on the check it seemed that we may have been forgotten about.  Perhaps they just figured we were not ready and didn't want to rush us, which I can certainly appreciate.  However, I would just recommend being a bit more attentive after meals are finished :)Thanks for the great experience, keep the good food coming Malatesta!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The house pinot grigio was surprisingly good and set a nice start to the meal. The focaccia house bread's very flavorful with rosemary & herb.  We started with the grilled calamari salad, which had a wonderful char. The spinach gnocchi is as good as everyone says - I'm not a cheese sauce fan but could appreciate the richness of this one. I had the tagliatelle ragu - the fresh pasta had a nice bite but the ragu could have used a bit more seasoning.  Luckily they provide a black pepper grinder and a mug full of parm for the table.

358,EcYi5shqDStI69fxoQnYNg,Daniel Y.,1.0 star rating,"The first oddity I noticed was that the restaurant seems to like placing rolled pieces of paper over their light bulbs. I was afraid a fire would break out because one of the pieces of paper (within my range of vision) had a large burn hole in it. I'm not sure if it's for mood lighting or what, but the proper application of lower wattage bulbs or even lamp shades could do the same without the hazard.Second, it's packed like a can of sardines. I was in a party of four and there was one table with four settings that was about the size of a coffee shop table for one.I'm not into pastas so I chose the Costoletta Di Agnello (lamb chop). Three Frenched lamb chops with spinach and new potatoes. The potatoes were crispy, but improperly salted - some had a lot of salt and some had none. The spinach was a nice relief from the meat and potatoes.Now, the star of the plate should have been the lamb chops. I ordered them medium and they came out nearly medium-well. And it seems that the kitchen rushed the order due to the crowds because they didn't let it rest enough - all of those precious juices were running all over the wooden cutting board they were served on and eventually all over the table. Sad. This left two of the pieces a bit dry and tough with the third just barely right.For the price, I'm sure there are far better Italian options.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

After hearing so many wonderful reviews about their spinach gnocchi, we were really look forward to eating it. Came here on a really humid summer day and was disappointed when they didn't have AC or good-working fans (ceiling fans did nothing). However, we didn't care because we were certain that the food was good.My boyfriend was set on getting the gnocchi. I wanted to get a different dish, but the reviews convinced me to get the spinach gnocchi, so we both ended up with the same dish. The food didn't take long to come. First bite in, I immediately noticed that the gnocchi was realllyyyy soft. At the first bite, after tasting the flavor, I understood why people liked this dish. HOWEVER, this dish didn't do it for us. We got so sick of the flavor after a few short bites. I would've liked it if they had some sort of meat in the dish. I couldn't finish it at all, I left a lot on the plate. My boyfriend couldn't finish it either. It just didn't taste amazing to me. I was very disappointed. The reviews made it sound so amazing, but it was just mediocre to me.I got tired of the cream flavor so easily, as well as the soft texture. I regret not getting a different dish. There were very few customers in the restaurant and yet it was hard to spot down the waiters, because they seemed distracted in their own conversations and they were following each other around. We asked for the check for the first time, one of the guys said okay, but it seemed like he forgot because we never got it and we had to ask for it again. They also didn't bother to check up on us during the meal, seeing if we needed water refills or asking if the food was good, like other waiters are supposed to do. We felt horrible wasting the food, so we decided to take it to go. Later that evening, we cooked up some sausages and tossed it in with the pasta to finish it. It tasted better because we had a different flavor/texture to eat it with, but it didn't make it completely better. We still got sick of the flavor really easily.In the end, we were disappointed. I guess we shouldn't trust so many positive reviews sometimes.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

But since some people who got there earlier didn't return, my friend and I were seated in about 15 min.Although I don't really like gnocchi, I couldn't resist ordering the spinach gnocchi that everyone raved about. Our food came out super fast (maybe because our entrees were the gnocchi and a spinach salad). The serving size of gnocchi was huge. I'm a girl who can eat and even I couldn't finish the whole thing. It was different from any other gnocchi I've ever had before. It was good, but didn't blow me away. Guess I'm just not a gnocchi fan. My friend was really satisfied with her salad. We also shared an appetizer of crostinis, 4 huge ones of different variations (mushroom, salmon with mozzarella, etc). We definitely got the bang for our buck with the crostinis.We clearly had overstayed our welcome, but the waiters were nice about it and didn't prompt us to leave.

We were in the mood for some Italian after the Whitney museum and this came up close by. The place is very small and cozy and the staff was very attentive. They serve some Rosemary bread I believe with oil and balsamic on the side to add which is always nice. The menu was simple but it was a little messy looking which you can see by a picture on Yelp. We got the 2 different gnocchi and the tagliatelle la ragu (2 orders). Everything came out very quick and was fantastic. The gnocchi was very pillow like and the sauce was rich. I was able to steal a bite of the other dishes and the tagliatelle did not disappoint. The meat had a very fresh flavor taste to it and homemade pasta is always great when it is properly cooked al dente. The spinach gnocchi was also very rich in flavor and portions for all were large.

The tiramisu was a pretty good size and tasty but not anything special with regard to a typical tiramisu. It was pretty loud in here as the kitchen is open to the dining area and some club type music that played around 9pm which I guess is trendy for the neighborhood, but I'd personally rather listen to traditional Italian music at an Italian restaurant. It was a little warm inside the restaurant sitting near the kitchen as all of the doors/windows were open to the outside where the temperature was in the 80s. Unfortunately this is a cash only establishment which I wasn't aware of until after the meal and I had to go to a store two doors down to use their ATM (and inevitably got charged to use the ATM) - I wouldn't have dined here had I known about the cash only.

I wouldn't exactly call the waiter someone you could warm up to though.As for the food...Calamari - my favorite dish all night!  I was expecting the breaded and fried, cut up pieces of squid you usually find at Italian restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised to see that this one was different.  Instead, you get the whole ""bulb"" part of the squid, grilled to perfection, on top of a bed of arugula leaves with a lemon on the side.  Wonderfully seasoned and awesomely delicious.  I would definitely recommend!!Veal meatballs - yum!  It doesn't come with any pasta or anything, but the portion is decent.  The meatballs were tasty and the complimenting tomato sauce was superb.Spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce- apparently this dish is highly recommended by a lot of people as well as my coworker, so I decided to go for it.  Having never tried gnocchi before, I wasn't really sure what to expect.  For some reason I thought there would be something other than just straight gnocchi and sauce.  The texture of the gnocchi was great and the dish tasted good for the first 4 bites, but I was not a fan.  It's very filling!  The sauce is great, but I wish there was more flavor in the whole dish itself.I will probably be back for more calamari and to try the seafood spaghetti which caught my eye from the table next to us.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Who's gonna know?With the recent first snow came thoughts of pasta and feeding the cozy rolls of fat making their way over the top of my mom jeans. For some reason, I hadn't been for Italian food in almost two years. A bit of poking around yielded Malatesta as a solid, economical option.I tend to be a bit cautious of places with too many exuberant reviews but some of the more detailed descriptions of the food convinced me this place was worth a try. So two friends and I gambled on the snow reducing walk-in business (no reservations for groups of fewer than four). We were in luck and were seated straight away. Whoo!The interior was very pleasant, with tiled floors, unfussy furniture squeezed in tight. Yes, this is a crowded space, but not unpleasantly so. The servers were very cool guys, attentive and quick. Whoo!We shared an order of grilled calamari on arugula. People, this was not calamari. It was CAL-AMORE. With every bite, I was feeling it in all the right places. It was one large squid, grilled and seasoned just so. Whoo!We also had:_Fettucine special with pesto and shrimp, a winning combination of flavour, texture and colour. Whoo!_Spinach gnocchi, delicate and light, in a beautiful cream sauce. Whoo!_Veal polpette, solid meatballs in a solid tomato sauce, perhaps the only item which wasn't truly remarkable. But Whoo anyway!_Pannacotta with strawberry sauce, a very fine rendtion, silky as a hipster's hand. Whoo!_Coconut pudding, essentially pannacotta with strawberry sauce, sprinkled with toasted coconut. Yeah, Whoo!You could say the evening was a huge success. The place had filled up as we readied to leave and it'd grown quite loud. So this is probably a place to go with good friends, people you're comfortable with. As inviting a space as it is, I wouldn't put it in the High Romance category at its peak hours, despite the intimate scale and attractive lighting.

With no surprising shock that the wait would be a solid hour, we had some drinks to warm us before. Although our table wasn't ready yet when we first arrived, the hostess was more than accommodating and friendly. The not-so-terrible ten minutes of waiting paid off, as we were given the bad-ass, VIPesque table suited for large groups. There was about 10 of us and it couldn't have gone smoother. The thought a large group on a Friday night in NYC for dinner just screams chaotic, but the service was fast and diligent. Wine was served and bruschetta was delish. I couldn't pass up the gnocchi, which usually isn't my style. Though rich and decadent, I enjoyed every bite that I could physically finish without feeling like a big beluga whale. Their menu denotes a very basic, but solid Italian feel. Nothing too fancy or over-ambitious - just your basic pastas. But from the table chatter, everyone loved their pasta dish.

The ambiance was great, and romantic (if thats what you're looking for), and it felt like the quintessential open air NYC dining experience. For the ambiance 5 STARS! So this is where it gets a little spotty. The service was fairly awful. It took forever for them to even bring us menus, and when we did, another waiting match to order drinks, more waiting, to order our food. Throughout the meal, our water glasses were never filled and we had to ask multiple times to even get them refilled. Napkins took 10 minutes, and the bill took even longer. We ended up getting the following and sharing: 1. Bruschetta - Fairly normal, not special, was not worth the money2. Penne All'arrabbiata - good and decently flavorful, not saucy enough3. Ravioli al Formaggio - good, but was a small portion4. Spinach Gnocchi - probably the best dish out of them allThe dishes as you can see were very hit or miss. With this uncertainty, we decided to skip dessert and go elsewhere for our sweet teeth.Maybe I had high expectations, but Malatesta did not reach up to my expectations, maybe it was a bad night, but not sure where all these five star reviews are coming from.

Place definitely could have gotten five stars had my wine and one other dish been better. Food: calamari was absolutely superb. Spinach gnocchi was great. Bruschetta totally average. Ravioli was average to good. Mussels pretty good. Tiramisu was weak and tasteless.House wine: I recommend just getting a bottle as they are not remotely expensive (~$30). I had the house wine though. My first glass had gone bad but the waiter was super cool about it (he didn't give me the skeptical stink eye look waiters usually give when you send something back).

It almost feels like you've stepped back in time, in to an Italian kitchen in the countryside. Every server is native Italian, so you can expect ""buonna serra"" in a thick Italian accent coming at you. The food is very simple, very tasty and reasonably priced (more like a $$ 1/2 out of 5). Malatesta is best in the warmer months when you can sit outside and people watch. There are no reservations, so try to arrive early; by 7pm there will be a long wait. Bring cash with you because no credit cards are accepted. There is an ATM next door if you need it.Ambiance: Malatesta is very small, but in the summertime, the side doors open up and its tables sprawl out onto the city sidewalk. The tables are wooden, the chairs are tiny, and there are no table clothes here. Be prepared to take in some bizarre sites as the crowd spilling out of the Christopher Street PATH train trots, saunters, parades and sashays by your outdoor table to the Christopher Street pier.Food: The pastas are very good, however on this night I opted for protein. To start off I had the grilled calamari, which is plentiful - the portion size is incredibly large. I love how they grill the calamari rather than fry it. The wood fired grill gives it a smoky flavor. The chicken cutlet with arugula and tomatoes finished with olive oil is incredible. The chicken is pounded thin and lightly breaded. On this night, there was a sea bass special that was very tasty. The caprese salad is good, however the mozzarella could be moister.Service: The staff is laid back, attractive, and it seems are all recently off the boat straight from Italy. You can't find a waiter without a thick Italian accent, which adds to the authenticity of Malatesta. Wine/Drinks: The wine list is fairly limited and not extensive but that's to be expected given the price points. The wine options were selected to accompany your meal, not to be scrutinized as a stand-alone wine. If you are looking for great wine to eat with dinner you'll have to go elsewhere.Eat well my friends,- JustAGuyThatLovesFood.tu…",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The 10-15 minutes sounded too good to be true anyway. When we were seated we were handed hand written menus which I thought was a nice touch to go with the rustic look of the restaurant. Dinner started off with alright complimentary bread which we immediately scarfed down. I ordered a half carafe of Pinot Grigio and decided on the Spinach Gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce. I hardly ever opt for gnocchi since it's typically heavy and I usually get tired of the dense, doughy, starchiness only a few bites through the plate. Here, I enjoyed every pillowy, fluffy bite.

We got the mussels as an appetizer but it was extremely briny... did not like it at all, should have come with some buttered crostinis. Also the free focaccia bread was so dry, I didn't want to touch it- I would have loved some hot fresh bread to dip in balsamic vinegar and evoo.

It would be perfect for a cool summer night or warm afternoon. That being said, two important things to keep in mind: THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING AND THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH (2). I'm sure it won't matter as the weather gets cooler, but with these sweltering days lately, I can definitely see it being an important factor for diners. It's actually crazy hot there and I was patting down my forehead every few minutes. The wait staff was nice and smiled a lot but not particularly attentive or friendly. The place was packed at 9pm on a Sunday night so definitely make reservations. The food is above average (3.5) but relatively simple. Others strongly recommended the spinach gnocchi (solid 4) but because I don't really like the strong taste of gorgonzola, I didn't order it. However, I tasted a friend's and it was delicious! A good combo of creamy but light and buttery. I had their Arugula salad, which was pretty standard (3).  I also tried their special for the night, which was a seafood spaghetti (3.5) in a red sauce. I liked the texture of the pasta because it wasn't too chewy nor was it overcooked. The seafood was pretty fresh and they actually had pieces of fish in it. The tiramisu wasn't very good so I would recommend passing on that.  Overall, we had a great time with lots of food, prosecco and good company!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Food-wise I'm kind of scratching my head. For an appetizer my friend and I split the grilled calamari, which was very good. I found the pasta, however, to be mediocre at best. I ordered the penne arrabiata, but the waiter convinced me to go instead with a spaghetti fra diavolo, since the penne was the only pasta on the menu that wasn't made in house. This is a little odd to begin with -- what do they encourage everyone who orders the penne to switch their order? Why even list the dish on the menu? But I digress. The spaghetti, when it came, was so overcooked it reminded me of ramen noodles. And the sauce was nothing to write home about, especially if your home happens to be an Italian American one (which mine does, in case you were wondering). Did this place have an off-night? Did I have an off-spaghetti? If a cute little rustic Italian spot opens up in the West Village and employs beautiful trendy people who make you feel like something a deformed troll would vomit upon sight of, are people perhaps a little too keen to be enthusiastic about it?

437,S-9Y46QbH4pxJgUw1Lx0ng,Alisa L.,4.0 star rating,"When I go to a restaurant that has good reviews on Yelp, I tend to wear loose clothes so after my meal, I can hid the hints of my gluttony.  Alas, it's usually a self-fulfilling prophecy and Malatesta did not disappoint.  First, this place is charming - from the seats outsides with the candles in the little plastic bags, to the Italian waiters, to the little boards they write the menu on, to the glass bottles that hold the water, olive oil, and vinegar.  And at some other Italian establishments in the city, waiters tend to be snobby when you ask them to explain a dish or when you have questions about the menu.  Not at Malatesta though!  And the famed spinach gnocchi?  They were amazing, delicious, light, airy, and obviously homemade.  The sauce was also very good, although very rich, and the gorgonzola wasn't overpowering at all like I thought it would be.  My only complaint is that there was just too much of it!  Anyone who knows me knows I almost never complain about large portions considering I have the appetite of Michael Phelps.  But this portion was too large considering the heaviness and density of the food.  If two people split it, it'd be perfect, but for one person, it is too much.But yet somehow, we still ordered dessert.  The tiramasu was very good - the mascarpone was creamy but not overly heavy.  However, there weren't many lady fingers in the piece and the espresso flavor was almost non-existent.  It was almost like eating a bowl of the mascarpone  - which was delicious - but  too much without the sharpness of espresso to cut through the creaminess.  Again, this dessert was huge, too big for one person which makes me glad I split it.My only other minor complaint is the fact that you have to ask for olive oil, balsamic vinegar,and bread plates and that they take it away after a few minutes, presumably to give it to someone else.  Why don't they just buy more of those bottles so customers don't have to gobble down their bread before the olive oil is taken away?",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

When I asked the hostess if she needed my name for a table, she said (unsmiling), ""No. I can remember you."" After being seated and waiting for about ten minutes, I asked the head waiter if he'd take our order, he said (scowling), ""I'm not your waiter."" Soon after our waiter hurried over, looking hassled and annoyed and said, ""Is everything all right? I didn't know you were waiting THAT long. I've been waiting on twelve tables."" I don't care if he was waiting on forty tables. You don't say that to a customer. We ordered beer and wine. My bottle of Moretti came without a glass. Appetizers: Very good and nicely presented Piadina. Mussels in a tomato broth were...good. Spaghetti Sorrentina was excellent with perfectly cooked pasta. Tagliatelle Al Ragu was no big deal and lacked flavor. When I indicated that we wanted the check and no dessert, the head waiter within seconds placed the check on the table, without a thank you. With a twenty percent tip, the total came to $90.00. I've since spoken to other people who've eaten there. The consensus is: The dishes range from mediocre to good to excellent. The staff is overwhelmed. The service is terrible. The place is always very busy and loud.

451,FeXoi2sH83H18PgS1o_TGg,Campbell K.,5.0 star rating,"Generally speaking, when a nice restaurant chooses to:a.) Not accept reservationsor b.) Only accept cash,you can be assured that it has the goods to back it up. This is, without a doubt, the case when it comes to Malatesta. I love the open plan in the summer, and the outdoor seating is the most wonderful place to spend a late night polishing off a few bottles of wine amongst friends. That always seems to happen here, incidentally; a projected ninety minute dinner turns into a four hour one, and we toddle away at midnight wondering how we could have become so lost in good company. Although everything is fantastic, the gnocchi really takes the cake. The spinach or the classic, both are beautifully crafted, soft and light, as the perfect gnocchi ought to be. It really is an artform. The garnishings are always nice, but the sauce always makes it pop. On top of all of this, something about Malatesta strikes me as extremely ""authentic"", if that means anything. The waiters remind me, strikingly, of those I have encountered in Rome, Umbria, Firenze, and the like (speaking of which, I have to go catch a plane!).

If you have a sweet tooth, you need to get the Panna Cotta, its the perfect light and sweet treat after a heavy meal like pasta. Also, great prices for amazing food.The ambience: its the perfect little hideout when you want italian comfort food done right. maybe no more than 10 tables, candle lit, and very homey. Never too busy, which is amazing for the city.its always been my little secret spot but they're so good I just had to share. Enjoy!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

On a Saturday night even, the wait was only about 20 minutes, but come early because it gets extremely busy. This place turns to knob down on how pretentious some Italian restaurants can be and returns with authenticity. The décor and basic menu (which has a rustic presentation) makes you feel like you're in some informal trattoria in Italy.  The bruschetta is a great, simple starter. It's a hard dish to mess up, but  you'd be surprised. I had the pasta Bolognese. Thankfully, all their pasta is fresh and handmade, which really is a huge different from dried pasta. I would never touch dried pasta again in my life if I could. The sauce and pasta were done perfectly, a proper sauce and well cooked pasta is all I need to keep me content. Simplicity is king with food, especially Italian. I would highly suggest this for anyone looking for a reasonable, budget dinner date.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The inside is very intimate, dark, lit by candles in paper bags and lace curtains. It is truly a beautiful restaurant and one where I could have feasted on the ambience alone. Luckily though, there was the food.I had the spinach gnocchi which was.. HEAVEN. Seriously though, that was by far the best gnocchi I have ever had: handmade pasta with a homemade cream sauce and garnished with fresh basil. I died and went straight to Italian heaven. The house chianti we got was pretty good as well, very strong with a robust flavor. Then the tiramisu came which I was dreading since I was so full. To my delight, however, it was simultaneously a good portion and very light to counterbalance the heaviness of the main course.The waiting staff was composed of a group of sweater-clad hotties (HUBBA HUBBA) and were very attentive.

Hostess and servers were friendly, responsive, and generally knowledgeable albeit a bit rushed during our time there since it was thundering. Rustic, dark decor with dim lighting can get in the way. Onto the food - simply put, it was amazing, especially for the price point. We had a grilled calamari, spinach gnocchi, and ravioli with pink sauce. I literally wanted to lick my plate because the sauces were so rich and delicious and the pastas were cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. Great place if you can nab a spot as it does get busy and although it's fairly priced at $12-$24 per pasta/entree it is cash only so come prepared!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

And no, I don't always remember to take them before indulging in cheesy or milky goodness. In the heat of the moment, you've got to reach into your purse, search frantically for it, and spend minutes ripping open the packet...and that can kill the moment. I'm sure we've all been there.I decided to just go for it, so I had an unprotected cheesy encounter last night. I'm paying for it today, but boy was it worth it! The cheesy encounter I'm referencing is the famed spinach gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce. It wasn't even the dish I ordered-I ordered my gnocchi with tomato sauce because I wanted to be good. But my friend had to taunt me by ordering the dish the way it's supposed to be...and I found myself sneaking forkfuls every time she wasn't looking.It reminded me of the best gnocchi dish I've ever had (until last night, anyhow), at a red-sauce Italian place called Luigi's in Anaheim. The gnocchi there was covered in alfredo sauce, so it was a bit heavier, and the gnocchi at Malatesta were a bit fluffier, maybe because they were made with spinach. They literally melted in your mouth, but they were served so piping hot that the first few bites didn't have time to melt before I had to swallow them!My other friend ordered the fettuccine with meat sauce, and it was excellent as well. Not heavy, but still hearty. I kept stealing bites of his as well, but the clear winner at the table with the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. This place was CHEAP for what you're getting-the entrees were all around $14, which is a steal for this neighborhood and the portion size! The bottle of wine we ordered was the best Pinot Grigio I've ever had (Kossler, I think it was), but it was around $40. We asked the bartenders if the cheaper one (which was around $30) would be a decent option and they assured us that the extra ten bucks would be worth it. And it was! It was silky smooth and just a hint of sweetness, making for easy drinking.The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bread because it had rosemary in it and I can't stand rosemary (food poisoning incident a while back that I still haven't gotten over), and they served the bread on a small plate and didn't bring another plate for oil/vinegar. Most places bring each person their own plate, so it's a good thing I was with friends who I didn't mind sharing with!The wait wasn't bad either. On a Saturday night at 9:30, three of us only had to wait about 15 minutes. They let us squeeze in to the ""bar"" area where we ordered our bottle of wine and chilled until we got our table. It's a great neighborhood and setting for people watching, and they have all of the walls open to the outside. Definitely a great place to come with friends or a date!

Well, the staff was all Italian, I could not see any cooks in the kitchen though.I heard they make their own pasta, so I couldn't venture too far away from that. I was tempted to try to the spinach gnocchi, but i saw they had a Spinach Fettuccine so I went with that instead. For $9 appetizer, I had a nice bowl of mussels in tomato broth, and that tasted perfect. The mussels were large and plump and the chunks of tomatoes and broth made a perfect soup. My $17 carafe of San Giovese was also very tasty. Now the Main course, the fettuccine, kicked some serious butt, It was a large portion, had a few large shrimp on top and was doused in a really light tasty tomato sauce that did not have me running home to mama.

558,Kg5ElVUGEzlsWc0mY9m9Pg,Bella F.,3.0 star rating,"Let's start with the ugly. I've been living in the neighborhood for about 2.5 years now and found this gem one night when my bf and I went walking around the block. On a slow night you will get the great service with witty/funny waiters and a nice hostess. On a busy night (which seems to be every night now due to it's word of mouth popularity and when the weather is amazing) you will encounter a hostess who is rude, lies, and waiters who are condescending and also lie. Going back to the lying, I have called before and made reservations for 2 in the past and for some reason now they do not take reservations for 4 and below. As i walked up with a group of 3 I was quoted a 45 minute wait. Having worked in a restaurant setting that was constantly busy I knew the wait time would be less than what I was quoted because I observed 3-4 tables near the end of their meal. I had no preference of inside or outside, but to my surprise once some tables were available my group of 3 gets pointed towards a table that is small in space while a couple gets a table with more space (this table in particular was occupied by a group of 3 so it would've been a no brainer to seat us there). When I make this observation I let the hostess know if she could switch us since the smaller space would be more suitable for 2 rather than 3 and she responds with telling me that this other couple had made a reservation. OH really?? Now you're taking reservations for parties of 3 and under? I was pretty annoyed and let her know and some other waiter who was trying to explain to me that that was my only option or I could wait 20 more minutes. Pssssh thanks for being so accommodating.Now the good: the grilled calamari and Spinach Gnocchi: MUAH! Yummy yummy yummy!!! Although I will point out that this last time they served the calamari on a bed of mixed greens instead of the usual arugula and please note: GO BACK to the ARUGULA. The bite and bitterness of it suits the calamari better than the mixed greens.To wrap this long review up, I would recommend the manager to hire hostesses who are confident managing the front desk. I would also recommend you go back to allowing parties of 2 to make reservations, and learn to make exceptions depending on the situation (placing smaller people in tighter corners, etc). My bf and I always bring our out of state visitors to dinner about 1-2 times a month and  year round and we recommend this place to anyone who asks' us where they can get decent Italian food. We want to continue to support our neighbors and their establishments, but teach your employees to cut the attitude and teach them about customer appreciation. I am sure they wish they could work a more glamorous job, but until then smile and interact with the guests who are putting money in your pocket.Buon Appetito!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

I wish it was more inland but perhaps during the day the views of the river make the leg of the journey over there worth it. CASH ONLY",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

And if you want Italian, though Little Italy might be the natural choice, I think the best can be found in the Village at Malatesta. Thought the translation of the name is ""bad of head,"" I cannot say anything bad about this place. First off, the waitstaff, male and female, all look like models. Though that sounds shallow, it doesn't hurt to have a beautiful meal served by beautiful people. Many have clearly ""off the boat"" Italian accents which isn't something you hear too often these days...usually you get some sort of Carmella Soprano type, not that there's anything wrong with that, but these people are the real deal. So, the food...Well, it's a simple menu scribbled on some paper-mache like tablet. I usually just get the bruschetta and the gnocchi di patate, requisite glass of chianti, of course. My mother and nonna would be pretty upset to hear this, but it really is the best gnocchi I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked doughy goodness in a well-seasoned sauce. They are super filling though I swear I could gorge myself on a second helping just because they are that good. Here's the thing: it's cash only and being New York and all, it isn't exactly cheap (but I still think with the portions it's pretty reasonable). All said, I can't imagine a trip to New York without heading down to the Village to eat here because Malatesta stands out among the myriad options on the island.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

It's kind of cramped but has an old world Italian, candlelit vibe that's rather charming. I am seated and my BF walks ahead and asks another waiter where the restroom is.  The waiter looks ready to deal out some serious shade, asking him first does he have a table. Because nicely dressed people walk in off the street, in the middle of a primarily residential area, to use the loo in a cramped Italian restaurant? whatever.The restaurant was half-full, which is exactly of how I felt about the entire experience. We were waiting on a third to join us (approx 10 minutes) and since the restaurant is so small you can see all the waiters clustered in the corner, watching us wait. Our waiter, the host and the bus guy  kept circling around during all 10 of these minutes, so we ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers ( bruschetta- very simple and fresh | Artichoke Salad[special]- decent but weird textures), just so they would sit down somewhere. Also there was a menu of specials that was included with the regular menu.  It was written in sharpie,  on a ripped off piece of box. I think this is what some people go to NY for, to see these kinds of shenanigans and later describe them using words like ""authentic.""I ordered the special which was Fettucini with crab in a tomato sauce, my BF ordered one of many Tagliatelle's with a Robust meat sauce and my cousin, porcini ravioli with sage and butter sauce.  The food was good.  The sage butter sauce literally tasted like butter, heavy cream and a sage leaf, which is nothing to write home about. The pasta was homemade, though a bit more al dente than what I prefer, likely because they took the pasta off too early so they could watch us.I dont think anything is exceptional here, though it is a very affordable, basic italian meal with some ambiance.

Unfortunately they don't take reservations for parties smaller than four, and if you come here I do recommend a group. In addition to reducing your wait time the spot is also kind of noisy.Tables for two are tiny and a bit haphazardly arranged.

I guess this wasn't a researched decision (would have been helpful to know what a piadina was), and I was expecting a traditional caprese platter. What we got instead were these little tortilla sandwiches that highly resembled quesadillas... In fact, yes, it basically was a glorified, Italian quesadilla. Substitute mozzarella for monterey jack. Would pass on this option next time.For my main I did the spinach gnocchi. It definitely tasted homemade - gnocchi was light and pillowy - but I actually would have preferred if the gorgonzola sauce was stronger. It tasted more like a ordinary cream sauce to me.

The staff is a cast of just-off-the-boat Italians (that are almost too Italian to believe) and service is given generously. The details of this place, down to the bottle of tap water, olive oil & vinegar on the table and hand written menu, all go along with the overall feeling of being in someone's home kitchen. I had big expectations for the food...and my expectations were not only met but exceeded. The pasta is perfectly fresh and full of flavor and character, the sauce is bursting with the taste of vine-ripened tomatoes and basil and the temperature just right. As mentioned above, the veal meatballs were PERFECT!After being wined and dined, the dessert was a fitting ending to the meal. I had the Tiramisu and it may be the best I've ever had.I'll be back...and I'll be there in warmer weather when I can sit outside!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

""Close to an hour"" they said.  and asked if we could please wait outside.  In the cold.  We were treated like walk ins!  Strike 2.A party of 7 walked in for their reservation and because they had to wait 10 minutes more for their table to be finished and she could speak italian- they each received a complimentary glass of prosecco. Strike 3.  Meanwhile, as we continued to wait (it was too cold to go back out) for over half an hour, there were 2 reserved tables that were vacant the entire time.  Extremely unfair.The manager is extremely rude and does not know how to run a business - especially with the lack of skills of a hostess who did not know how to do do...anything without the manager.  'Ho male alla testa' should be the name of the restaurant.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The atmosphere is homey and intimate without feeling stuffy, and our server was very attentive.The food was incredible, from the crostini appetizer to the homemade tagliatelle entree.

I also tried the salmon and house special pasta. I'd highly recommend any....the only problem part was that it seems the cheese is VERY rich. I was on the toilet all early the next morning. From having read through the reviews, it seems another reviewer warns against the home-made pastas if you have a weak stomach. That's me. However, I did not want to write a bad review about the restaurant since I did enjoy the different pastas and didn't hear from my friends/family having food poisoning.Another qualm I have with this place is that they do not give you individual plates for you to pour oil/vinegar on for the complimentary bread. It seems disgusting to be sharing one plate for the bread and dipping sauces for a party of 6! Did end up with more plates but I felt uncomfortable having to ask for more. I guess I'm just accustomed to places like Macaroni Grill and Maggianos which always give individual bread plates.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

602,j_Zl9YYimHY1ZDovFYIncQ,C. K.,1.0 star rating,"Worst. Service. EVER. I knew we were off to a bad start when the extremely rude hostess seated us, a party of two, after several other parties of two that arrived after us. And no, they don't take reservations for parties of two, so it wasn't because they had reservations. She kept saying we were next and then would seat someone else; later she insisted that she was trying to get us a table outside (which we didn't ask for and she didn't end up giving us!) and said it wasn't her fault. We would have left but were starving by this point and couldn't imagine waiting in line again elsewhere, so we stayed against our better judgment.We would have complained about our experience with the hostess to the manager, but we quickly realized that rude and inattentive is just the name of the game. Once seated, it took forever to get a menu, was challenging to find someone to take our order, we never had our water glasses refilled despite many requests, and getting the check was a feat in itself. When we requested prosciutto on the side for a shared dish as my friend is vegetarian, we were told ""no, the kitchen is busy"" in a rather annoyed tone. We opted for a vegetarian dish, but it's surprising that a NYC restaurant wouldn't even attempt to accommodate a simple ""on the side"" request. The food itself was decent - nothing amazing. It seems the popularity of this place may be due to the affordable prices and large portions, but there are so many other delicious, affordable places at which I would rather have been. Two stars for the food and prices, minus all stars for the service (though apparently the lowest I can go on Yelp is 1).

We were greeted at the door by a member of the staff who let us know that we should come back in 30 minutes. Good thing we did! there was a line of about 15 when we came back waiting for the doors to open.Firstly, the bread they bring to the table is freshly baked and comes with tasty oil and vinegar; they'll bring you more bread as you finish your basket! The Spinach Gnocci is probably the best I've had; the sauce was unreal and the gnocci was perfectly doughy and fluffly, probably because they produce all the pasta in house. Also had a sage/cheese ravioli dish which was to die for. Do yourself a favor, check this place out if you're in the mood for an authentic Italian meal.

The mixed greens was pretty standard, but the sautéed spinach salad with garlic and white wine was a delicious surprise. As for the pasta, we had their gnocchi and ravioli, both in a pink (cream and tomato) sauce. The pasta dishes were all fantastic. The salads ranged from $7 to $10 and the pasta dishes were between $13 and $16. The only reason for the loss of the star was the noise level in the place made conversing at our table difficult at times.

615,r24XtUtPccNiLBXMtiWPfA,Michael W.,4.0 star rating,"While looking for a casual but still nice dinner spot for a date, I came across Malatesta. Located right in the West Village wasn't flashy at all. With some nice indoor and outdoor seating, this place gave off that chill but still intimate setting that I was looking for. For parties under 4, Malatesta does not take reservations. Even so, I was able to come here at 8pm on a Thursday evening and still get a table without a wait. However, an hour later, this place was pretty packed with a bunch of people waiting outside. If you're looking for a place that is out of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, then Malatesta is your spot. As far as the pasta goes, they do make their own, which is pretty neat if you like that homemade pasta taste. For starters, we went with the grilled calamari. This was a great deviation to the fried calamari that most places serve. Nicely served on a bed of greens, the calamari had a nice grill/char taste to it, while still being chewy and juicy. Definitely one of the better plates of calamari that I've had in recent memory. For entree, we both coincidentally ordered the Penne All Arrabbiata. This pasta was the only one on Malatesta's menu that wasn't homemade, but that did not make it taste any less awesome. Loaded with tomato sauce, red hot pepper, and parsley, this dish was full of flavor. What I really liked was the fact that it wasn't overly powerful. There wasn't a soup-ful of sauce lathered on top of the pasta. Instead, it was lightly mixed into the pasta, giving it just the right amount of flavor. Malatesta is a great place for a date. The lighting is just right, there is an open dining area, and it's also a casual restaurant that won't break the bank. In total, with two beers, an appetizer, and two pasta dishes, the total came out to be just shy of $60. Quite reasonable, considering the fact that the food was pretty solid as well. Note: This place is cash only. I made the mistake of not knowing that beforehand. Thankfully, there is a deli next door with an ATM.

I ordered the spinach gnocchi and my bf ordered the seafood pasta special. While the gnocchi was cooked well and highly recommended, it's a little too heavy for one person. It's cooked in a heavy cream based sauce, and being me, I also sprinkled some parm cheese so it not a meal for the faint of heart. But since we shared dishes, I was spared from a heart attack waiting to happen. The seafood pasta was fresh and they were pretty generous with the seafood.

634,S2UjupmM6bDmhzogUXr7BQ,Anne G.,2.0 star rating,"The evening started out great. My girlfriend and I were seated although our party was not complete.  Our other friend unfortunately had some trouble getting here and was about half an hour late. They did not rush us at first. I ordered some wine and after awhile we ended up ordering an appetizer. When our other girlfriend arrived we ordered dinner. Two of us had the tagliatelle bolognese and it was delicious. We kept ordering wine and ended up getting dessert- the tiramisu. It was very good. So up to this point it was great. They left the check on the table but no one ever came back to ask if we wanted more wine or anything else. Now I do understand that restaurants have to turn over tables to make a profit but what comes next has never happened to me before. A woman comes to the table (this was not our server) and says to us ""it looks like you're done here and we need this table for another party.""  Again I understand it's the restaurant business and they need to turn over the tables but she really could have been more polite about it. It was very rude. And on our way out not one person said thank you for coming or thank you, have a good night which you always hear leaving - at least any restaurant I've been to. We passed her on the way out and she just gave us a very non-friendly look.  Now, my two girlfriends are minority so we wondered was it an issue of race? I truly hope that was not the case and that it was ""only"" an issue of rudeness. Sadly we would never come back, which is a shame, as the food was very good.

I had spaghetti with clams - the spaghetti was definitely homemade which makes it delicious, but a little to thick for my taste.  The sauce, tender clams, and fresh parm made up for the spaghetti girth, though I would order something else if I could do it over again.My date had the spinach gnocchi which was fluffy and tasty.  Her portion was huge, so I offered my assistance as any gentleman would. I give this place 4 stars because I think its a real authentic Italian place with a cozy atmosphere and good service.  One star off for being cash only (I live on credit card points) and just a tad overpriced for what you get.  It's definitely worth trying out for yourself!",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The menu isn't huge, but that's a good thing, otherwise I would have spent well over 30 minutes trying to decide what to order. Our table started out with grilled calamari, which was well-seasoned and served with a slice of lemon; it was a bite of summer in the middle of winter. For my entree, I chose the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola. The gnocchi was pillowy, melt-in-your-mouth, and luxurious; in other words, the opposite of every other gnocchi dish I've had in the past, which has been doughy, dry, and unbearably heavy. The gorgonzola sauce got a bit boring after a while, but luckily I was able to snag a few bites of my friend's lobster fettuccine (that night's special); the zing of the tomato sauce on that dish was a welcome break between mouthfuls of rich gnocchi. It's easy to see why the line is out the door at Malatesta. It feels like you're stepping into an Italian home (probably because it's on the ground floor of a residential building in the middle of nowhere), lined with bottles of wine and cute pictures. The servers are friendly, you get these amazing pasta dishes cooked perfectly al dente, and you don't break the bank. Seriously, it's like a miracle. Cash only.

So we get there and were awkwardly greeted and told we could sit wherever we wanted. We had a nice seat outside (which was by far the best part of this meal, the table). We were promptly brought bread with balsamic and oil. Quality was fine, but nothing to write home about. We ordered the mushroom salad, the scallop special, and the pasta with ragu. Each course was more disappointing than the last. The mushroom salad was by far my favorite, however it was flavorless. The scallop special sounded fantastic, but it turned out to be a crostini rather than a scallop dish (which was not clarified in the description), flavor again was fine but It needed something more, spices or salt or something. The pasta was overall the most disappointing. The restaurant prides itself in being homemade but nothin about this dish tasted homemade. If you'd have told me this was from a jar I would have been more impressed. The staff, while not bad was quite odd. They took the oil and vinegar on and off the table at least 4 times. They attempted to clear our plates before we finished eating, which we promptly vetoed. Instead they actually cleared our plates while the last bite was literally still in our mouths.While it's not the worst place I've ever been, I would never go back here.

I had fettuccine alla bolognese, I'd say about 130grams of pasta, which is a good portion, covered in meatsauce topped with fresh basilico.  We both dabbled in eachother's dish, and the quality of the food is top notch.  I grew up in Italy eating my mother's home made delicacies and also cook myself, so I can appreciate fresh herbs, top quality ingredients and ""al-dente"" for pasta is a must for Italian cuisine, no compromise here.I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet, it was regular house wine.  We skipped dessert since we agreed on getting fresh gelato afterwards at another place.Do go, the quality of the food is reccomended, however make reservations ahead of time to avoid the wait.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The sauce tastes so fresh and balances the noodles that are cooked al dente. Order with veal meatballs for more. The spinach gnocchi is also delicious but best saved for those days you're craving something extra hearty. The tagliatelle al ragu is also solid. Love the rustic, romantic atmosphere as well.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian
673,J7AN6w1wnp9JT0Q_zlvGgA,Eric F.,4.0 star rating,"A very solid restaurant, some of the best Italian I've had in the city. If you want the short version, yes, the spaghetti is absolutely phenomenal, some of the best I've had anywhere. Go ahead and order it.I also tried the tagliatelle, it was either a ragu or bolognese sauce - in plain English, a red sauce with red meat in it. It was very good. Not on the same level as the spaghetti, but still great in its own right.When they bring water to your table, assuming it's tap water (my standard choice), they don't put any ice in it at all. It's served at room temperature. To me this is a bit of an outrage. When it's over 100 degrees outside and there's no AC (I'll get to this), having to drink warm water is ludicrous. The wine they brought up from the cellar was colder than the water.Now, for me the aesthetics of a venue are hugely important, and that was one of the best things about Malatesta. I felt like I was transported back several decades in time, the place was very romantic, classy, homey. There was an ""air conditioner"" wall unit near my table that looked about 100 years old and didn't seem to do anything except growl a little bit. Old-fashioned metal ceiling fans.The space is very open to the outside, lots of windows and everything. Unfortunately if the weather is less than ideal this can be a problem, (I went on the hottest day of the year, with a 112 heat index. I could handle it, but most sane people wouldn't.) but if the weather is perfect, it's great. Personally, I'm a fan of eating food outdoors or at least while breathing fresh air, and most modern restaurants are too sterile and over-air conditioned for me.They don't take credit cards, which is always annoying as hell. But I just can't help but like this restaurant a lot, despite its flaws.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

We had the gnocchi and black pasta with octopus - the gnocchi is pretty much a mainstay on the menu, as it's one of their specialties.

Other dishes looked like it would be filling but one of my friend had to go grab a slice of artichoke pizza afterward so I guess the dinner wasn't enough for him.

The bread was good.  It wasn't italian bread, but the texture was more of a cakey bread which is the kind I really like.  I like soft bread and not hard bread.  I also like the fact that the restaurant had vinegar and olive oil at your table, all at your disposal.  Nice and convenient. I ordered the veal meatball, which is a very small portion (only 5 quarter-size meatballs) so if you are a heavy eater, you should probably get something else on the side.  The veal meatball was very very tender.  I didn't like it much because it felt more like mush to me than tender meat.My friend ordered the steak, which I tried and LOVED.  We drizzled lemon juice (dish came with lemon on the side) and ate the steak with the monchego cheese which gave it a very delicious but unique twist on steak.  For the pasta, we tried the special Black Ink fettucine pasta with seafood and a smiple pasta with only tomato sauce.  The Black Ink pasta was delicious since the pasta had enough chewy texture to it and also was smooth and moist.  The pasta from the marinara sauce felt a bit dry, as if the sauce did not seep well into the pasta. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the panna cotta.  The panna cotta was my favorite.  So creamy and drizzled all over with raspberry sauce.  The mousse was also good, but not a good one to pair with the panna cotta.  It became too sweet and overwhelming for my taste buds.  The atmosphere was very friendly and homey.  However, even though the restaurant seemed to have 6 different waiters, we always seemed to have a hard time flagging down someone for help.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Came here with 10 others for a friend's birthday dinner but I think this would make a great date place. Nice and warm ambiance. Very friendly wait staff. Terrific prices and homemade pasta. Pasta is definitely the theme here. The appetizers was just ok, standard, nothing mind blowing. I did get to sample some of the standard pasta items from the menu that some of the other girls had and it was alright and good. Luckily, me and another girl, were the only ones that ordered from the specials that night and I do have to say that I absolutely loved my cannelloni which was delicate and had the right amount of ricotta, spinach, mushrooms and olives inside. The tomato sauce was great and it was dolloped with a little basil pesto here and there. Great choice!

This place keeps it simple with hand written menus, limited wine list and cash only. It is usually full with a young crowd plus a small crowd waiting. I have been here a few times, and I confess I've commited my own number one ""no-no""...I have ordered the same entree every time...and I have to reinforce what everyone else says, the spinach gnocchi in that thick, creamy gorgonzola sauce and grilled octopus app are absolutely delicious! The portions are not huge, but it is so rich that I think it's an appropriate serving. Every time I have gone, all my gal pals have loved their pasta dishes (many raved about the hand made spaghetti) as well. It's so reasonably priced and has always proven to be a great choice for a casual dinner with friends.A little side note for all you girls, my best bet is that all the male servers here are recent European transplants trying to make it in the acting/modeling biz.

LOVE the Bruschetta, had that for appetizer. Crusty bread topped with basil, olive oil and fresh chopped tomatoes. For dinner, we ordered the Spinach Gnocchi (made in the premise) and Grilled lamb chops. The spinach gnocchi is fresh and airy, served in a luscious cream sauce. The grilled lamb chops are served on top of arugula, fried potatoes and sauteed spinach. I could do without the veggies and go with the chops and potatoes instead. But still, I'm not complaining. The lamb chops have to be the best I've ever had; it was moist, flavorful and nicely charred. The dessert was nothing to write home about. The tiramisu was passable but the creme brulee felt like an abomination. Cold custard with burnt sugar (it was black) on top. It lacks the fragile crunch on top when you break it with a spoon. I'm reluctant to give this place less than a 4 star but if the dessert is good, it would have made my list of 5-star restaurants.Washed the dinner down with a glass of Prosecco (coz that's how I roll).

The inside area is completely open and exposed to fresh air, and there is an overflow of tables and chairs for the perfect outdoor meal. Ah, such a romantic setting. The waiters...are very Italian. And by Italian I mean extremely sexy.  From the dashing hair to the incredibly sexy accent...I guess there's a reason I haven't even begun to mention the quality of the food. Nonetheless!! After asking the waiter a few questions about different items on the menu (not just to listen to his accent of course...) we decided to try the Penne All' Arrabbiata, Ravioli Al Formaggi, and the super recommended Spinach Gnocchi. The Penne was pretty good, traditional tomato sauce taste but nothing amazingly out of the ordinary. It was a nice dish to compliment the other creamier pastas we had ordered though. The Ravioli was my FAVORITE one! Creamy pink tomato sauce and soft cheesy ravioli...simple, but so yummy. I'm not a fan of gorgonzola cheese but the waiter insisted that the Spinach Gnocchi was his favorite dish, so we decided to give it a try. To my surprise, the gorgonzola flavor was not overwhelming like it usually is, and the gnocchi was very chewy. It was pretty good, but after 5 bites it got a little too heavy for me.  Every pasta was topped with my favorite garnish, fresh BASIL.

While ordering request them to put the strawberry sauce around the panna cotta, rather than over it  to relish the pure bite and then you could always dip in the sauce.Well apart from the Panna Cotta had a mix experience at Malatesta(3.5 stars) yesterday. I went in with a heightened expectations for the Italian food and was bit let down. Started with Bruschetta which was simply seasoned tomato on bread, I expected a bit more flavor here.  My friend got Spaghetti Alla Chitarra saying she likes to try the basic dishes of any cusine to see how good they can make them and then order more exotic ones. I decided to go with the raving reviews  about Gnocchi. Well the spagetting was decent although I felt it was nothing great, basically I expected it to standout instantly compared to any usual Italian place. My Gnocchi was a blunder, I mean considering its one of their best dishes it came as a rude shock. The tomato sauce seemed like a container sauce not at all fresh. I tried it twice to make sure I was tasting it right. I asked my friend to try it and even she instantly said this is NOT GOOD and suggested I should return it. I asked the waiter that to take it back. The owner/chef came back to us in a while asking what did we find wrong in the dish since the take a lot of pride in their Gnocchi. I frankly said I simply disliked the sauce although the balls were pretty good. He asked if I would like any other dish. Since my friend has more experience with Italian food she ordered for me, the Ravioli Al Formaggio and it was very good, loved the vodka sauce. The chef stopped by again to ask about the Ravioli and the Panna Cotta and we appreciated it whole heatedly. My friend even said that the Panna Cotta was probably one of the best she has had in NYC. I guess her appreciation earned us the Panna Cotta on the house and she also got the receipe of it from him.Overall I think it is a good Italian restaurant and surely worth a try more than once.

Most everyone had an opener, entree, and two glasses of wine (and a dessert and a couple coffees) which was $36 apiece. Not bad. We were able to secure a table for 8 @ 8 pm within 24 hours notice, yet the restaurant was full the entire time - a nice balance of busy but not impossible to get into. I had the wilted spinach as an appetizer and the spaghetti as my entree. Nothing fancy, but both well-executed. Sometimes the simplest dishes are the best. Other dishes that seemed to go over well were the gnocci dishes and an appetizer that was a variety of crostinis with toppings.

It was a brisk, windy night on the west side and I had dinner for two at Malatesta for early evening on a friday night.On the menu? We started with two antipasti, melon and prosciutto as well as a caprese salad. The caprese was delicate and the prosciutto was thin, salty and delectable.The specials for the day were written on paper bags, a delicate detail that's always nice to see.I love their pastas. Simple, really. But it's all about the ingredients and the preparation and I have to say I love both at Malatesta.The ambience is excellent for any occasion whether it be a date or family get together or a friendly reunion of sorts.The prices aren't ridiculous yet the place really feels and tastes authentic.This will continue to be my go to place for good Italian eats.

If so, why don't you just say so to your customers, and with a glass of wine on the house, problem solved. Being honest and straightforward should be the way, yet not a word.So as we wait for an hour or so for our starter (salad), I look around and nobody is getting served, people looking around and towards the kitchen in the hope that food starts coming out.We ordered fettucine ragu and gnocchi in tomato sauce. When they arrive they are both drowned in tomato sauce out of a can, both the same, tastless. What is that all about. I read the reviews and people rave about their gnocchi. So I aks myself: 1) Has everyone gone mad?2) Have I gone mad and can not recognize greatness?3) This shite is not the ususal fare they serve.So, with the benefit of the doubt, I'd go back.

From the friendly host whom, I believe to be the owner. To the beautiful atmosphere that can only come from a place such as this. The interior is rather small; thus, making this not a place to have dinner with a large party. The intimacy that comes from the individually lit tables, the background music playing. Even the murmur of other people's conversations. ( it can be rather loud.) We were seated in a corner at a table near the window. Had it been warmer that night, we would have said yes to the waiter when he asked if we wanted to open the window.  Bread was served immediately along with our drinks of water (standard issue)  Again alluding to the atmosphere of this place the menu is hand written and doesn't seem to change at all maybe never. As they say "" if it ain't broke don't fix it""  for an appetizer we had the arugula salad ( mix of greens & tomatoes tossed in a vinigrette,  w/ hint of lemon) , grilled calamari. We ordered a bottle of chardonnay. For entrees, my friend had the spinach gnocci in gorgonzola sauce. My other friend and myself indulged in something we knew we would like!  We both had the tapliatelle al ragu  (Spaghetti with meat sauce). You can't go wrong with that ? Our food was served within about 15-20 minutes after we had finished our appetizers. Plates piping hot paired with our bottle chardonnay! It was something out of a movie. The right selection of wine makes every meal perfect.  Eyeing my plate I thought the meal would be impossible to finish. Boy was I wrong. Not only did I finish my own but had eaten half of my friend's spinach gnocci.  Even cleaning the sauce off of my plate with bread.Overall, great dining experience.

We were going to definately pay for it cause we ordered it, but they saw we didn't like it and just took it off with out us asking.

756,5Ep_divxeE3SG2itUsyadg,Charles H.,5.0 star rating,"The food was terrific, the atmosphere was ideal, and the staff was so nice and enthusiastic - we were very very happy with our choice in going to Malatesta. We are touring colleges with our sons and wanted good in house made pasta in a classic new york ""mom & pop"" cozy restaurant. We did not want fancy, we wanted great food and warm quality atmosphere. To give you an idea of what we found at Malatesta, five of the 6 pasta dishes on the menu featured house made pasta, love that. I had the spinach gnocchi and balanced it with the chicken cutlets. I love gnocci but it is generally to rich to eat solely as a main course so I ordered the chicken cutlets knowing the rest of the family would share it to accompany their own pastas. That strategy paid off nicely. My wife ordered the tagliatelle ragu and my sons had the gnocchi de patate and the spaghetti alla chitarra. The dishes were done just right, by my standards; simple but fresh, not heavy, great quality fare. Then we got weak and ordered three desserts; coconut pudding, crème brulet, and chocolate mousse. As we ordered our desserts I had second thoughts and feared it was going to be a painfully rich ending. But each dessert was divine, not rich or overly sweet. Even the crème brulet was not heavy, dense, or too sweet but had a light tasty custard quality to it. Again, simple, fresh, and clearly home made. Lastly, big thumbs up to the staff. I wish I had their names to thank them each specifically, but it was as though we had four young smiling and relaxed owners on hand who wanted to make sure were taken care of and happy from start to finish. They were cheerful and attentive but never over bearing. Maybe I am being overly complimentary simply because Malatasta was exactly what I was looking for. But we only have time for a few meals in the Big Apple and I wanted to do it right. Hopefully we will be back, and we will send friends in the meantime.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

762,UmpLAu9-YhJV41m5ormXDw,Allen Y.,3.0 star rating,"So I'm a bit torn about exactly what to think about Malatesta. If I considered myself more of a food snob/foodie/fine food ""expert-in-training"", I would probably give this place a 4 or 5 star rating. But, as a more practical eater who just likes good tasty food, I had to bring it down a little bit.My thoughts:-Location: Not great from public transportation, but that's what you get for going to the West Village.-Decor: Kind of has an old-school Italian feel, which is nice. Had all the windows/walls open despite it being a hot day, so the entire restaurant was just on the verge of being too warm.-Space: Kind of cramped-Service: Perfectly fine; absolutely no complaints here-Food: Here's the sticking point. All the food definitely tasted VERY fresh (most of their pastas are homemade), but freshness doesn't always translate to tastiness, and I was pretty underwhelmed by my pasta with ragu (as was evidenced by the heap of parmesan I dumped on my pasta). The appetizers were alright but not mind-blowing, and came in small portions. I almost thought that the tastiest part of the meal was the bread + olive oil + balsamic they gave at the beginning...The spinach gnocchi was definitely the best dish at the table but I'm not sure if I'd be blown away by eating a whole platter of them.-Prices: Eh, decent for Italian food. Cash only.So all in all, if you're looking for the ""West Village"" experience, or a ""classy"" but still kind of cool Italian place to bring somebody, consider this place. But honestly I've felt like I've gotten Italian food I liked more for around the same price but in an easier place to get to at other restaurants.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Make sure you go at an off-hour if you have 2-4 people because they don't take reservations for small parties. The food and wine were great (for the price). Yes I've had better and more fancy Italian, but if you adjust for the price you really can't beat it. Excellent pasta and buratta. We ate and drank our fill and I was shocked at how low the bill was.

We returned after an hour and our table still wasn't ready; we had to wait another half hour outside.  I've been to Malatesta before, so I wasn't surprised or outraged.  However, when we got our food, there was a HUGE half-alive bug in the caprese salad! I showed the waiter, who was extremely apologetic. I saw him tell the manager about it as well. He brought another caprese, but we were a bit wary of it. Still, we ate most of it, and the rest of the food tasted good...although bugs were on our mind for the remainder.    The reason I'm writing this negative review is that the salad was not taken off of our bill and no compensatory measure was offered to us.  Sure, this is a gray area for restaurants, but most nice places would do something to show that they are sorry and that they realize that our meal was subpar as a result of their mistake.

They weren't the the best in town. But paired with some wine and good service, our dinner here was quite worthwhile. It's not a huge place and given its popularity and the closely arranged tables, there isn't a whole lot of privacy for conversation. 21 planted an image in my head to which I reacted with a few loud ""eew""s and ""gross""es.

I've experienced better.""The atmosphere is good - it's great sitting outside on a nice summer night, but then again we have a lot of those places in the Village. Location is great for me because of where I live, but for most people it's going to be a few blocks off the beaten path. It is definitely always hopping though, so people obviously find it.Food: definitely not worth all of the 4s and 5s out here on Yelp in my opinion, and that's what this review is after all. The fettuccine with crab, as others have mentioned, really is nothing memorable. I also expected much more from the lamb meatballs. Overall, not bad, but nothing to go back for again.Many people have commented exactly correctly on the service. It's disinterested at best. And the cash only thing is soo annoying! Do they not realize it actually hurts their business? People (myself, but I think lots of people) buy a significant percentage more when they pay on credit card. I don't want to have to be doing math in my head with every glass of wine I order to know if I have enough cash. Thus I'll err on not ordering it.

I found this place whilst doing some extensive internet searching (including yelp) and couldn't have been happier with the results.My challenge was that I had mostly vegetarian friends who are on budgets and a few pretty picky eaters so I needed a place that would be simple, rustic, and inexpensive - yet really tasty since this was our last night in town and it was a special celebration. I called ahead the day of and was able to get a table for 7 at 6:30pm (a little early for nyc standards, but it worked with our schedule, so what the hey). We arrived a bit early and we were seated immediately and allowed to wait almost a half an hour for the rest of our party to arrive without any hassle. Some yelpers mentioned this was a ""big"" place - but it really isn't at all. it's a small corner bistro with some outside seating. We ordered the piadine with proscuitto to start - and it was really delicious. So simple, yet so GOOD. And the bruschetta was also fresh and flavorful. I ordered the special - a handmade fettucine (they make all their pastas in house) with fresh crab and a tomato sauce. Totally amazing! Other dishes I tried at the table were the ravioli with pink sauce, both of the gnocchi plates (UNBELIEVABLE) and the sea bass special with an artichoke salad. Everything made my eyes roll back in my head they were so good.  For dessert, we all shared the chocolate mousse (my choice) and the creme brulee and coconut pudding.

After struggling to find a place to satisfy a group of friends with varied dining requirements, I stumbled upon Malatesta (on Yelp of course!) And it's no small accomplishment that my entire group of diners emerged from the restaurant stuffed and full of raves. Reasonably priced wine & entrees, fast & patient service, and an inviting atmosphere were the first attributes that became immediately apparent. But as our appetizers and entrees began to arrive, the food quickly overshadowed all else. The mussels! The mussels! The mussels!! OMG, for $9 we were served a huge helping of delicious mussels in a light tomato sauce. So simple, but fabulously seasoned. (oh, and as a good Italian, i implore you to BE SURE to sop up the remaining sauce with your Italian bread.)For entrees, we sampled a few different gnocchi, one with tomato sauce and one with Gorgonzola. sauce. Excellent! We also had a dsih comprised of flat homemade noodles with tomato sauce and shredded crab. It's immediately apparent upon first bite that Malatesta makes their own pasta. Which is essential to a quality Italian meal. The sauces were excellent too. Attention to details like fresh breads, fresh spices and quality ingredients seals the deal.If only i hadn't been so stuffed, I might have sampled the excellent-sounding desserts -- mousse, tiaramasu, mmmmm. Malatesta is definitely bursting at the seams (on a chilly Thursday evening, the place was full to capacity.) So one drawback is that the restaurant is definitely noisy and everyone is seated practically in each other's laps. Other than that, my only comment is that i wish the menu had a liiiiiiittle more variety to it -- maybe more in terms of a pasta/vege dish, or a seafood/pasta dish. Definitely check out Malatesta.

With regards to the service, I did not think the service was great.  The waiters/servers do not fill/refill your glasses - you have to do it yourself ~ I found that a bit odd; aren't the waiters there to help serve you?  Additionally, I never knew who my waiter was.Get there early because the restaurant fills up quickly.  Also, they do not take reservations unless you have a party of 4 or more. **CASH ONLY**  They do not take credit cards.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

My friend told us about how her coworker (from Italy) raved about this place, stating that it's the only decent Italian restaurant in the city. Boy was he right! I came here with 2 of my girlfriends. First of all, they're very true to the Italian feel. No air conditioning, strict window ventilation. You have the option of indoor or outdoor seating, and it's pretty crowded. Go with the outdoor, it will definitely make your day. We started with the bruschetta. The bread was crispy and soft, all at once. The tomatoes and basil were definitely fresh. Talk about a great choice! We then ordered their special for the day- Lobster Fettuccine and a Ravioli Al Formaggio. My friend loved the ravioli, she said it was absolutely great. My other friend and I had the lobster, talk about ""worth your money"". They gave us huge chunks of lobster, the pasta and sauce combinations worked wonders in my mouth. Add a little black pepper and olive oil, you're basically set for life! The service was very decent, had them refilling our water and bread. They were very prompt and quick, given how crowded the restaurant was. It also seemed like a great place to have a night time dinner date, a very romantic feel to the ambiance. My only issue with this place was the odd location. It's next to the Hudson River on the west side. Not so accessible by train.

Almost all the pastas are made in house and you cannot go wrong with any of them.  I do warn everyone that their cream sauces are very rich and can be overpowering if you don't know what you're in for.  Their tomato based sauces are just delightful and always keep an eye out for the pasta specials because I haven't had a bad one yet in my 10+ trips to the place over the past few months.  White wine sauces are just the right amount of oil, none of that pasta-drowning-in-oil thing you find other places doing . Wine is very reasonable in price (but again nothing fancy, just solidly drinkable) and the speed at which they bring the food out is shockingly fast.  One piece of advice if you like arugula salad - ask them for their thick shaved Parmesan cheese to top it off.  They used to add that automatically to the salad but now you have to actually ask.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

After finishing the meal and the last of our overpriced wine, the churlish host approached the table and informed us we had to leave because ""he needed the table.""  To add insult to injury, the waitstaff were dodgy and discourteous when asked to speak with the manager.  Four calls later, the seemingly disinterested manager was at best mildly apologetic when confronted about his employees' brusque disrespectful disposition.Unfortunately the food is over-hyped and unable to overshadow the unbearable waitstaff and experience at Malatesta Trattoria.  The Bruschetta is a run of the mill appetizer.  The Tagliatelle Al Ragu is mediocre at best.

867,rxEacgkkQAVExggEumwVSA,Jennifer L.,4.0 star rating,"This place is like going to Italy. Small, crowded, noisy and with the occasional person bumping into you because the tables are packed so tightly together. And yet... it was a charming little restaurant that felt very gezellig, as the Dutch would say. Despite how busy it was (my three friends and I came here for Christmas Eve dinner), we never felt rushed and we had a great dinner. Just note that it's cash only. And that you should make a reservation because did I mention how crowded the place was and how many people were waiting out the door to get in? Zipping by these people to get seated at a table is a great feeling!So, on to the food. We had the grilled calamari and the polpette (a secondi) to share. I LOVED the calamari. It was seasoned perfectly and oh so juicy. It might be because I love seafood though, because I was the only one really raving about it and one of my friends didn't particularly like it. I think she had expected fried calamari or something. As for the polpette, which is veal meatballs, the dish was good but I would have preferred it to have more of a kick. Then again, I like things spicy--maybe others like this dish just the way it is. It was definitely a solid dish.For our mains, I ordered the spinach gnocchi after reading all the rave reviews here about it. Two of my friends ordered a special, which was spinach fettuccine with shrimp and zucchini in a tomato-based sauce, and another friend ordered another special, which was ravioli stuffed with artichoke and served with an artichoke based sauce (I think). The Spinach Gnocchi is indeed amazing but because it is so rich, anything past the first few bites is no longer so good. I couldn't finish my dish because it was just too rich. My friend's ravioli was surprisingly good and I enjoyed what I tasted, even though I am not a fan of ravioli or artichokes. The portion was the smallest of the three main dishes, though. The best main dish was definitely the fettuccine. The fettuccine was cooked just right, the serving size was perfect, and it didn't make anyone feel sick upon finishing the dish. I stole more bites from my friends than I probably should have. Mmhmm!For dessert, we had the tiramisu and the dark chocolate mousse. Now, I usually love tiramisu and usually do not order mousse desserts because I don't particularly like the texture. But this time around, the dark chocolate mousse was really outstanding while the tiramisu -- despite the positive Yelp reviews here -- was disappointing. I would disagree with many reviewers here and say that the chocolate sauce is the only thing that makes the tiramisu good. I had asked for it on the side but ended up eating it while ignoring the tiramisu. I think they got the heavy cream to mascarpone cream cheese ratio wrong because I couldn't taste the mascarpone cream cheese and the fat from the cream stuck to my palate. They also don't use ladyfingers but instead use some sort of sponge cake, which was too soft and didn't taste like it had coffee liqueur in it. All in all, as someone who has eaten tiramisu all over the world and knows what a good one is supposed to taste like, I was disappointed in the tiramisu here.That said, with generally high quality dishes, a great dark chocolate mousse and friendly staff, this is a place worth visiting anytime.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

The place has a great neighborhood-y vibe and the decor is impeccable. The food had me at ""hello"" with a fresh and crisp apple arugula salad topped with house-made ricotta cheese so creamy that it felt like I would hear the cow mooing next to me. The house made fresh bread with olive oil is a perfect starter, hard not to fill up on before the main course arrived! Glad I saved room for pillow gnocchi and a bite of truffle oil pasta as well.

I believe I had the gnocchi or something like that, and it got rather overly cheesy and heavy near the end of the dish. The bread was decent, although I was hoping for something more crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside; it was more of the crunchy kind. Price-wise it seemed a little overrated for me; I feel like I've had better. Service was friendly and nice, although I found myself thirsting for a while now and then.

Large portion. Special with shrimp, noodles and red sauce--Shrimp were very over cooked. This dish was extremely salty. Large portion.We would have returned the shrimp special but guess what.......no one stopped back to ask how the meal was. They never and and I mean never asked how the meal was. To me this is a complete sin. In fact the only other things they asked were to toss down a dessert menu and bring the bill. We both only finished a portion of the entree and there was no offer to box the remainder. They just tossed the other plates on top and off they went.I compare this meal to one I had last week at another place in the East Village and there is no comparison.

885,CzgyyxsNfcp7Uf9FGayS6w,Jennifer L.,4.0 star rating,"On a quiet, unsuspecting corner of the West Village sits a little Italian restaurant that has stolen my heart.Malatesta is cozy and welcoming. You feel at home from the minute you walk in. The flickering of candles in little white paper bags gives each table a magical glow. And the modest, handwritten menus come rubber-banded to a thin slab of wood.The service at Malatesta is outstanding. The waiters are very attentive accommodate to your needs. When the weather gets nicer you can also sit at the outside tables that line the perimeter of the restaurant. Okay, on to the good stuff. The food...oh the food. Most of the pastas are homemade and the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola gets rave reviews, so ordering was pretty much a no-brainer. But before we get to the main course, let's start with the appetizers. We ordered classic bruschetta and mussels in white wine sauce with tomatoes. The bruschetta was very tasty and seasoned perfectly...a great way to start the meal. The mussels, on the other hand, were pretty disappointing. Now, I really love mussels, but these were a bit on the larger side and tasted like seawater. My third (and last one) was a little gritty as well. But let's be real, I wasn't there for the mussels. Both times I've been to Malatesta, I've gotten the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. And in all honestly, I don't think I'd ever get anything else. Why mess with a good thing? The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth and the gorgonzola sauce is creamy and not overbearing. Since the dishes are pretty large, I like to get 1 pasta and 1 meat dish and share them. This time around I also tried the veal meatballs. Five meatballs come served on a bed of Marinara sauce, accompanied by 2 slices of bread. The meatballs were great! (Not the BEST I've ever had, but very savory and tasty.) And a nice accompaniment to the creamy pasta. The couple we were with tried the gnocchi with marinara sauce and the papardelle fra diavlo. I tried both, and both were also very good and tasted extremely fresh. We actually got a table close to the open kitchen, so I got to see a lot of the dishes being prepared. It was really cool to see how the chef would precisely cut thin rolls of pasta dough and (just like a party streamer) out would come a string of papardelle. To end the meal off, we got coffee and dessert. The espresso was very good. Strong and flavorful. They don't have American coffee, but they can make lattes and cappuccinos. We also tried the tiramisu. I would have been fine without it, actually. The cake was a little too dry for my tastes and they covered the whole thing in way too much whipped cream. But again, I certainly wasn't there for the dessert. If this place knows how to do something well--extremely well--it's the pasta. So as long as you stick with what they're good at, you'll be full and satisfied.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

Recently I brought a party of four for dinner here and we had a great meal and a wonderful time. It was a sunny Sunday early evening and about 80 degrees in April. We sat outside on the corner for optimum people watching. The ambiance added to the night, I'm sure. The waiter recommended an Italian white, which we took. It was perfect; light and lemony. We started with a plate of grilled calamari, which was doused with some really superior olive oil. The calamari was grilled to perfection. You could still get a hint of the grill which was really nice. Along with that, we had a caprese which was very nice and light. I think they used plum tomatoes which were smaller that what you normally get with a caprese but, also made for convenient individual bites. The mozzarella was light and creamy. For dinner we shared two pastas: Penne Arrabiata and a homemade pasta special tossed with oil, zucchini and ham I believe. The arrabiata sauce was a stand out because it started sweetly and the zing snuck up on you. The highlight of the pasta special was the actual homemade pasta, itself. And the ingredients that came along with it were a nice blend of sweet, savory and salty. Entrees: Red snapper for two of us was perfectly grilled. It came with arugula salad and steamed spinach (replacing potatoes at no extra charge). Grilled Lamb chops for one of us which were medium rare on the nose and fell off the bone as the meat should. Bistecca for the other was again, precisely medium rare and served with shaved grana padano on top. We all shared and were all happy with this wonderful offering.

No reservations and this place was packed for Friday dinner...  but the beauty of being the fairer sex AND choosing well in the dating pool is that this part's always taken care of by someone else :)As it was drizzling that night, there was no outside seating (which would have been lovely on day with nicer weather) but we scored ourselves a great table by the window.... not only did we have an awesome spot, we were also able to make use of the extended table space provide by the ledge.

For pastas, they usually have great specials, but I recommend the gnocchi with Gorgonzola, anything with the pink sauce, or the simple yet delicious spaghetti alla chitarra. Of all the pastas (most of which they do so well), the bolognese is my least favorite. The atmosphere inside is casual yet cute. Definitely has a rustic/authentic feel.

The gnocci was well done - not too hard or too soft. My only complaint is when you serve a dish of gnocci with no other ingredient besides gnocci (+ sauce), it can get boring very quickly. The spinach part of this dish is baked into the gnocci (I think) as I did not find any pieces of spinach anywhere else.Porcine ravioli (special of the night); my friend ordered this dish.

Other Yelp'ers ratings were high, the menu looked good, and there was an outdoor area. My bf got the spinach gnocchi and I tried the spinach gnocchi and substituted the pink sauce. The gnocchi was fine. I've had better frozen gnocchi but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The big problem was the pink sauce. ""Homemade"" is definitely an exaggeration. This sauce was definitely out of a bottle/can. It was TERRIBLE. I was really disappointed with my meal. Did I mention it took almost an hour to get said meal? And that it wasn't crowded? And that no one gave us an update/apology/etc? We are not picky people but there gets to be a point where it was ridiculous.

Our server said it was like a pizza sandwich--it is a freaking tortilla. I ordered it for double the crust! It was nice biting into the thick mozzarella slices. Okay, so, honestly, this place might get four stars if I weren't a little bitter about the piadine. Oh, and the server asked, ""Just the piadine as your entree?"" Ahh, well maybe I wouldn't have gotten it if it'd been described as a quesadilla! Ahem. I'm nearly over the piadine. It was definitely good for what it was, though.The spinach gnocchi had a thick cream sauce, but not much spinach flavor.The desserts were faboo--how can you go wrong with panna cotta and tiramisu?

Upon being seated and given menus I felt a little ignored for a while (I want my wine, and I want it now!) but was happy that wine was also affordable in quartinos ($21 was the most, for the chianti). The highlight of my meal was the grilled calamari over arugula, big pieces of calamari cooked just right, firm but not yet rubbery. They have several fresh pasta choices, and thought the parpadelle with mushrooms in truffle oil was a really good light dish. I had the seafood ravioli, a solid dish that came with marinara sauce but probably would have been a much better dish wish a fra diavalo, cream or vodka sauce. I was surprised about the amount of ravioli per serving, probably about 8.

We started with the Bruschetta (very tasty - excellent tomato flavor, especially considering the time of year). I had the potato gnocchi and my date had the tagliatelle - the homemade pastas were great, and the sauces had that subtle tang that's lacking from inferior dishes. We finished with the creme brulee, which was good with a nice crisp caramelization. Excellent value, to boot - sharing the appetizer and dessert certainly helped in that regard, but having a delicious three-course dinner for only $30 each is practically unheard of in this city.

Not enough Italian places make pasta dishes with fresh moz. The prices were beyond affordable, $13 for pasta dishes. The gnocchi were also yummy. Don't forget a small carafe of wonderful tasting Pinot Grigio at $16 to help polish down the fabulous good.

Excellent food (which is most important to me), nice atmosphere (though a little cramped), and fairly good service (a little slow, but that can be a good thing). As other reviews have stated it is dimly lit, it has a very nice feel and you can forget that you are in the West Village. Seating can be tight, and if there is a large party there isn't very much space left, but it does make the experience a more intimate one. My wife and her friend both ordered appetizers which were brought to the table within 15 minutes. We were there a little on the early side at 6:30 on a Sunday night however. For the main dish I chose from the specials, cavatelli with prosciutto and peas in a cream sauce. It was delicious and there were large chunks of prosciutto. The serving size overall was just right. Now when I said service could be a little slow I meant that as a positive. Since we were there early there was no rush to free the table up and I guess the staff saw were were talking and relaxing so they left us alone. Just made sure our waters were filled and were quick to bring the check when asked. That was nice to not be rushed. Overall a nice night, great meal and a place I will visit again.

Which isn't a bad thing it's just a cumbersome thing. They have a decent wine list. The food was good. We started with the bruschetta and it was a very basic seasoned-tomato on the bread. I always expect bruschetta to be full of condensed flavor but this is why I gave the place only three stars. We then shared the Spinach gnocchi which is delicious. The serving is actually quite large so I would encourage couples to share. It was cooked very well and the sauce was just the right blend of gorgonzola and cream. We also had the veal meatballs and as good as it was it was only 5 meatballs --not very large meatballs either--on a plate of sauce. THe meatballs were delicious, don't get me wrong, but I think it would have helped to include some accompaniment to the dish. More sauce just made the meatballs look smaller. Overall it wasn't a bad meal. The wait staff was attentive and they were very polite and kept refilling our waters. The ambiance was an urban chic: exposed brick wall, tight seating and hand written menus. Will I go again? Yes.

Super reasonable prices, large portions, and amazing outdoor/open air indoor seating on a warm night. Service is best described as European, harried, and somewhat overwhelmed by the continual crush of people wanting to eat here. The men in our group were not complaining about the elfin hostess and her extremely short and lightweight slip dress. It was a blustery evening and we'll leave it at that. We put our name down and had drinks at some bar in the neighborhood while we waited. The hostess had gotten my number wrong but they were still able to give us a great window table and wine while they set it up. The caprese salad ($9) was a decent starter but the tomatoes had not hit their peak yet the way they had in CA. I went with the shrimp and asparagus linguine special, the manfriend had the tagliatelle with ragu, and I also tasted the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce as well as ravioli in pink sauce.

Bottles of wine were affordable and we split a variety of appetizers, including the gnocchi pasta. Listen to the waiter and order off the specials list. Ultimately, food was delicious and cheap.

The Ravioli Al Formaggi (which was good , but it is the kind of thing you can make at home) and Gnocchi di palate ( was okay) . The lamb chop (2 pieces) and steak (slices ) were served on small chopping boards with some greens as the bedding so the portion size a bit small.

The restaurant is very open which is great because one can see the Hudson and feel the river breeze.We had some bruschetta appetizers to start. The bruschetta was OK but not great. The bread was sort of chewy and not stale.I had the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. Very good if you are into gnocchi and cheesy creamy sauces, which I am. Nice texture to the gnocchi and very filling.I got to sample another pasta that had pieces of pancetta in the sauce (don't know the name of the pasta), which was also very good. The salad with artichokes was also very good.Prices are inexpensive by Manhattan standards, ranging from 12 to 14 dollars. Appetizers are 6 or 7 dollars.

Yes, the atmosphere is cozy, but everything is so rushed that the food that comes out is nothing more than slop. We ordered 2 pastas and they were served within maybe 3 minutes of ordering. I understand that ragu is not going to be cooked to order, but it just felt like it was an attempt to close our table and seat the next party. It wasn't just the speed with which they came out, but it was the complete and utter lack of flavor. We actually started with the mushroom salad special and it tasted like nothing. There was absolutely no seasoning, and I'm a person who always complains things are too salty. Likewise with the pasta. Between the gnocchi with tomato sauce and the ragu, there wasn't much difference. It was red. The fresh basil was the only thing that had any flavor. Even the grated cheese couldn't make up for the lack of seasoning in the dishes. We fared a little better with the main dish, the chicken cutlet. There are better Italian places in this area.

At least ASK if we would like some, options please. The waiter bumping into my chair without so much as an excuse me did not help but unfortunately things become even more precarious as they deliver one of the ""special pastas"" of the evening; Fettucine with crabmeat and basil. Fortunately my girlfriend ordered the Spinach gnocchi which was tender and tasty; very good or I would have starved to death. Well, not exactly, but close. Here I was psyched for some homemade pasta with fresh seafood. It was bland and the seafood did not taste fresh, kind of a tinge to it that was not quite right. No one bothered to ask us if everything was alright so I take it no one really cared if it was. My girlfriend thankfully ordered the better dish so I ate hers with my cold bread without any butter. The Diet Coke was good. Very bubbly but let's be honest, I was hoping for more. Grilled Calamari could have been more tender, kind of tough, too much chewing was going on there, you kind of needed shark's teeth to get through that dish. My girlfreind's salad was good.

So far an idiot waiter. Was about 6 foot 1.  blonde curly hair that was falling out with glasses. skinny build. very white. anyway he leaves, me and my friend decide to what to eat or what to drink. since there is no description on the HOUSE WINE I was gonna ask which was the HOUSE chardonnay was. he returns after me and my friend are drinking tap water and dry (no compliment) bread WAY TOO LONG, he returns, I ask about the wine. he responds ""ITS A HOUSE CHARDONNAY. ITS FROM ITALY"" well that explains it all doesnt it? right off the boat and no communication skills nor knowledge of anything about the menu, but Im suppose to TIP HIM? WTF? anyway he gives me a tasting. its nothing short of ok. we order. OK, I dont know if all the specials on the SPECIAL MENU were suppose to be cold, but they were. I have an artichoke salad that was cold, sliced and laid over arugula with a slice of lemon. Wasnt bad acutally but disappointing at the same time. Then we have a long wait for our entrees which mine was grilled tuna with haircvot and fennel salad. I asked for rare. THANK GOD the other smaller waiters walked by and asked us for more drinks. jesus. The entrees came and were good, very good. but COLD COLD COLD. I didnt think everything I ordered should be cold. if I wanted cold tuna I would have had japanese place. If I wanted completely cold vegs throughout my mean, I would have gone to a raw vegan place.  overall, yes it could be great, but it falls short.",Malatesta Trattoria,4.0 star rating,$$,Italian

You get delicious food (which you get in a lot of places) but you also get pretty decent service and a chair to sit on, for a price that does not break the bank.The best test of a Italian restaurant, in my opinion, is how well they do the most simple dishes. And a restaurant is worth going to again and again when you can eat a pasta that you can't make a home, because to make an al dente pasta from dried pasta is simply not that hard, and to make a good sauce is really not that hard with bit of love and a lot of time. And so with this I ordered the spaghetti alla chitarra-- the homemade spaghetti with a tomato / basil sauce. And it was absolutely spot on-- everything was exactly as it should be. My wife ordered the gnocchi in a simple tomato sauce... and again, it was simply spot on-- fluffy light gnocchi, just the way it should be. I think this is amongst the best simple pastas that I've had in town, and unlike Scarpetta (which is delicious), it does not cost $25++ for a simple tomato sauce pasta!!! I think even Lupa and dell'Anima sometimes over-sauces their pastas to the point where it can overwhelm the dish, but little Malatesta just seems to do Italian food exactly as it should be.

Itty bitty place but they have 1-2 large tables in the mix so you can reserve it for a group. However, important to note, cash only! We ordered a few bottles of Chianti and got ready to hit it. I ordered the grilled calamari salad to start and it didn't disappoint. Love the charred flavor you can taste from the grill. I pretty much licked the plate so it was a success I'd say. For my main, I got the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. It was so good that Kath took it 1/2 way through and didn't give it back (damn her!) but I did get to enjoy the rest of her 3-cheese farafalle so all was not lost. The most expensive pasta plate was mine (heh) but at $13 for a homemade dish of pasta, please, I would have paid twice that. Also an added bonus: they have a whole bunch of cute, Italian waiters making the rounds. I swear we got a different one each time (which was fine by me).

I tasted it and did not.  A friend had the penne.  She liked it.  I did not taste it, so no comment there.  I had the spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce.  What can I say?  I did not like it very much.  The ambiance was nice and the main language spoken by both staff and visitors was Italian which added credibility.  The portions were large and the price was reasonable.
