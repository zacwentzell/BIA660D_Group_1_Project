It was a decent ""greasy breakfast"" but when I was writing this I thought, would I rush back if I had a hang over? And the answer is no. My wife had the eggs coccoti, I think it was called.

3,9Ib_3GLDwdbdImKddCC7JA,Susan C.,4.0 star rating,"An intimate corner location with a cozy British slant, Oscar's features a selection of breakfast options styled after the local morning traditions from across the pond. The place is small, but they take reservations, though the largest party they can sit is 5-6 people at the corner table in the back left corner of this space. There are two tables for 4, and another 2-3 tables for 2. On a sunny day they have outdoor sidewalk seating under red umbrellas enough for 10-12 people. These are set up as tables for two. Inside, the kitchen is basically right behind a bar area on the back right, and it's fun to watch the chef prep and cook. I highly recommend the English breakfast ($17), which is a hearty combination of two eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, grilled mushrooms and tomatoes, stewed beans and the mash of the day. I ordered the Arundel omelette ($14.75) which had bacon, onions, mushroom and spinach and came served with a side salad and mash. A second and third friend ordered the Eggs Cocotte ($15) and English breakfast omelette ($15.50) which both came with mash and side salads also. Service was courteous and quick, and we left very satisfied with our experience. As we were leaving we saw a berry French toast and a burger being served and they looked like great options to try next time.

For $17 it is a bargain and it's totally delicious. Ask for the Irish bacon instead of regular American bacon! Everything was cooked perfectly and service was great.

It's a small cozy place where it seems he has a bunch of regulars come in to enjoy the British cuisine.  The menu was filled with other entrées that looked very appetizing. There was a chicken pot pie that sounded delicious as well as the bangers and mash.  I will be coming back to try some more.  It will be hard not to order the fish and chips though. Since I know how great they were I will have to bring someone to try the fish and chips so I could order something else and pick off their plate.  Lol they also serve breakfast.British food done right by a British chap.

I ordered the English breakfast as I was craving English food. I mainly came here because of it since it reminded me of my time in London. I was not disappointed ! There were tomatoes, mushrooms, beans, sausage, bacon, and egg. Everything tasted authentic and the tea was fantastic! We sat outside since it was such a nice day and overall very much enjoyed it.

Bacon was crispy, and the mushrooms tender, though the eggs were only okay. Probably could have used some more seasoning (salt, sauce, etc).

The wine came promptly and not long after I was served the fish and chips with lemon, tartare sauce and tomato sauce served on the side and a bottle of Sarsons Malt Vinegar. Being a very critical fish and chip eater I was pleasantly surprised. The meal was piping hot which was excellent, the beer batter was light, crisp and flavoursome covering a very fresh, tasty piece of cod. The traditional chips (not thin fries) were definitely the better end of others I have sampled in NYC.

I've been going to this former Petite location for well over 20 years and as of recent I've noticed that my favorite Petite wasn't sustaining its former greatness. Much worse in fact. This time around I decided to give Petitie one last try when to my dismay I saw Oscar's Place painted on the glass front. We decided to try it and we were glad that we did. Upon entering little had changed from its former life--except for the missing Tin Tin books--and we were greeted by familiar faces. We inquired as to what happened and we were told the story of Neal's takeover. I was excited because to me Neal was Petite Abeille of Hudson and Grove. No other location ever captured our interest and we've visited them all. The menu has undergone a transformation from Belgian fare to British. Some familiar items included waffles and mussels. There were others but under different names. Gone from the menu is Natalie's spicy tuna. Enter David's spicy tuna. Who is David? Who was Natalie?

83,-GayORFHzyKaxJmTVdp-2A,Jenn F.,3.0 star rating,"It's a quaint little joint in the West Village.  Deciding between brunch places in the city has become an almost impossible task.  My brunch date was pretty picky and because of the great marks, we chose Oscar's.The restaurant has about 5-6 tables; none had a capacity more than 4.  Since the space is so tight and has irregular corners, they probably wouldn't be able to shift tables around for larger parties.  I checked into Yelp and got a free coffee.  I ordered the Big Ben(edict).  In hindsight, I should have opted for the Classic English breakfast.  It seems much heartier, and more my style.  The Big Ben is two poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce, smoked salmon, spinach, and tomato served with garden salad and a mash of the day. What I liked were the perfectly poached eggs.  There was practically no smoked salmon; maybe two small pieces- definitely not enough by any standard.  The garden salad was OK, but that tomato was ridiculously pale and sour.  My belief is that if it's not right, don't plate it.  Doing it for the sake of fulfilling a menu description is an injustice to the dish.  Most importantly, I found the Hollandaise sauce to be too sour.  Instead of accenting the sauce, the lemon juice dominated my palette.Oscar's is a nice place for a more quiet setting, and would have been properly priced if it had been rightly portioned.  However, based on the fact that the Eggs Benedict fared average, I wouldn't be enticed to return.",Oscar’s Place,4.5 star rating,$$,"Modern, European,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, British"

Due to the recently closing of the Chip Shop on 5th ave in Park Slope, I found myself looking for a new place to eat. The ratings for this eatery while few sounded favorable hence I convinced my husband to make the trip into Manhattan. The place was quaint and was packed. We were pleased to be seated immediately. We did note that none of the staff sounded British which should have been a warning right there. We ordered the Classic English Breakfast and were gravely disappointed. The baked beans were flavorless, tomato had  no seasoning and the eggs which we ordered over hard were burnt but still soft.I asked for the traditional marmalade which usually accompanies toast but to my dismay I was given strawberry jelly/jam.Sigh, I will not be returning.

My waffles were easy on my eyes and my tummy; it was a beautifully presented dish, with little rivulets of strawberry sauce slowly drizzling down the the peak of fresh whipped cream on top. As for the taste, I loved every bit of it; from the sweet freshness of the strawberries to the crisp edges of the waffles, it was perfection all around. I didn't leave one speck or crumb on my plate. My boyfriend also liked his meal, although he didn't get to finish it.Our service was pretty good, although we were the only ones in the restaurant.

I typically get the egg white omelet with spinach and it has consistently been great. My husband gets the classic English breakfast which is delicious. We tried the egg-which for the first time which may be my new fav. One of the best breakfast spots in the area.

As soon as I cut it open with my fork a waterfall of grease came out and the fish was soggy. I ended up ordering the Oscar burger in replacement and was very satisfied, but again the french fries were beyond oily.

154,bVJCf0bfAqe66ERg0FFyfg,Tampa D.,5.0 star rating,"I used to go to La Petite Abeille all the time for breakfast, and then one time I arrived to discover it'd been replaced by this restaurant. When I looked closer, though, I realized that the staff and the owner are still the same, and even some of the items on the menu are recognizable from the old restaurant. There are some new things (the English breakfast, for example) and some different twists on old items, but it's still basically the same old restaurant. The food is reliable, the service is good, and somehow there is always that one last table left for us. A nice little unpretentious place in the West Village.",Oscar’s Place,4.5 star rating,$$,"Modern, European,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, British"

156,XuIf5u9Zs1rqXgbQl2NUiA,Sean S.,2.0 star rating,"I went here with my wife to try a new breakfast spot and ended up pretty disappointed with the food. We ordered the Berry french toast and the classic English breakfast as well as two coffees.  First the coffee - this was pretty terrible coffee even by NYC diner standards. Most likely some sort of GFS coffee that had been sitting for over an hour.Berry french toast - $13 for two small pieces of french toast is fine for the neighborhood but the accompanying parts must be perfect and they were not. First no real maple syrup was available in the place and fake syrup wasn't even offered, although I did see it in the kitchen. The french toast was supposed to be a ""berry french toast"" but instead only had 4 strawberries next to a large pile of melon. Strawberries are currently in season and nobody wants melon with their ""berry french toast"" if they are going to serve it that way it should be ""melon french toast"".Classic English Breakfast - Where to begin? The sausage and bread were actually pretty good so no complaints there, but that is where the the good part ends. The tomato was tough and tasteless. The eggs that were ordered poached came out over easy. The mushrooms were overcooked. The beans were completely unseasoned, nothing like what you get in England. The bacon was the type of absurdly thin bacon that is cooked in the oven the night before and thrown on the griddle for 30 seconds to warm it up before its is served to you.Other than getting the egg order wrong the service was very attentive so they get a star for that.",Oscar’s Place,4.5 star rating,$$,"Modern, European,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, British"

But it's the same people, the same great food and very friendly and excellent service. The menu is updated and in plain English now.

159,BRtqYJ86-uXfFQM7gp3VYQ,Abigail F.,5.0 star rating,"I've never dined at a British/Belgian influenced brunch spot before but being that this was my first time, I was more than satisfied. I came here with my friend and we were greeted so warmly and enthusiastically by our server, Neil. The service here was awesome and his sense of humor made my experience eating here all the more better. I ordered the strawberries and cream belgian waffle with an english black tea (thats apparently popular in the UK). Moving on...the waffle was crisp and fluffed. The strawberry sauce added such a nice touch. It wasn't too sweet or too flavorless. My friend ordered the atlantic omelette which i think has salmon, scallions, and sour cream and came with a side of potatoes. I tried some of hers and lets just say I will definitely be coming back here to try that omelette! We both shared the ""soup of the day: asparagus soup"". I've tried many asparagus soups before this one and its by far the best..the soup was creamy, not too heavy, salted just right, and best of all delicious! This was a perfect balance for the sweeter dish I had. I can't wait to try more! :]",Oscar’s Place,4.5 star rating,$$,"Modern, European,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, British"
