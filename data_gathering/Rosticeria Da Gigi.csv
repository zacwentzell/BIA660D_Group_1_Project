It might be small on the outside and on the inside, but the flavor of their food is anything but small. I ordered the prosciutto and fontina panini. The prosciutto was a little chewy for my liking but it was the focaccia that it was served on, that was the real winner here. It was fresh, and perfectly toasted. I had a bite of my BF's cousin's sammie, which was chicken and sun-dried tomatoes on the focaccia, and I instantly regretted not ordering that one instead. He ordered the chicken parm dinner, which came with a side of pasta. Everything was average but it was the mozzarella cheese that really won me over. I feel like I could go in there and just order a few balls of that for lunch, if only that was socially acceptable.Trying to get to Hoboken's Mutzfest but low-key a bit sad because I just found out you need tickets, which are sold out.

My husband and I have been ordering breakfast pick up and/or delivery from Gigi for a couple of years now and I have to say they mess up our order about 75% of the time. Today was the last straw and as much as I like the offering I will not be ordering from Gigi againI almost always order the same thing - egg white omelette with bacon, cheddar, spinach and tomato. Last 4 times I ordered it - whole eggs were used instead of egg whites, tomato was missing, American cheese was used and the bacon was thrown on top, and this time the bacon was missing (completely unacceptable). I can still enjoy the omelette with any of the other issues but I cannot enjoy it without the bacon. I called and was told that they would send an order of bacon to my house - which was appreciated but the end result was that my breakfast got cold while my husband ate his without me. And our plans for the day were delayed while I waited for the bacon and reheated my omelette (and we all know how reheated eggs taste - yuck).Also the woman who answered the phone never once apologized for the inconvenience and when I mentioned to her that I would not be ordering from Gigi again because they mess up my order every time, she said ""OK"" with an attitude and hung up the phone. This is not the first time I have been given this kind of response when my order is wrong.It's a shame because the food is really quite good but I just don't want to keep getting the wrong meal followed by an attitude from the person who took the order incorrectly.

Breakfast is served along with seafood & vegetarian dish options.Which is quite a nice change for deli's around here.Also of note,dipped sandwiches are available.Prices are very reasonable compared to other deli's in Hoboken.I Would like to come back in the Spring when the weather gets nice again and sit outside for breakfast & a good cup of coffee.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It's definitely catering to a Hoboken crowd on the go since they only have 4/5 tables for seating and the majority of their orders are for take-out/delivery. I've ordered breakfast, lunch, and dinner for delivery as well as eaten here quickly before class at Stevens nearby and all the experiences have been great. Delivery is pretty quick in comparison to other places and a result, the food comes relatively warmer. Most recently, I stopped for a quick solo dinner and had the chance to talk to a lady who was either an owner, related to the owner or has just been employed there for a long time because she was very enthusiastic about their offerings and told me most of the following information with pride: Almost everything is homemade fresh daily, especially the hot entrees, sides and salads. They even make their own dressings and dipping sauces! Their turkey club sandwich, has been one of my favorites in Hoboken thus far. Love the Italians, but Gigi keeps it simple - nothing beats the fresh, thinly sliced turkey... yum! If you're in a rush and don't want to spend more than $10-15 for dinner or just want something emulating a meal that can be made in your own kitchen, then I strongly recommend giving Gigi a call.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Our server was a small Guatemalan lady who was pleasant and friendly but just kept forgetting things and took a really long time with things. We ordered two skim lattes to start, they came out about 15 minutes after we ordered them and they were warm not hot. Now, I know I get a littlecranky without my morning cup but really?!?! We then ordered a fruit plate, eggs, corned beef hash, toast with butter and French toast. Please note the WE, I am not that big of a honey badger. The corned beef hash browns barely contained any corned beef!! What the heck?!? If I wanted regular hash browns we would have ordered those. They were okay, but nothing to recommend. The eggs were well cooked and the French toast was good. Now, the toast was unbuttered even though we specifically asked for it to be buttered. My man likes his butter. So then we asked the waitress to bring over some butter and glasses of water. Five minutes goes by and no butter and no water, we can't even seem to find her and its a small place. We eventually just got up and asked the counter girl for some butter.  A total of ten minutes later our water was dropped off at the table.. Wow. It only only about 6 tables, and only 4 were filled, they should be able to provide good service.

My go to is always the eggplant parmesan. It is beyond phenomenal. Not only do you get a heaping serving of great eggplant with fresh mozzarella (non of that shredded cheese) but you also get to pick any side to accompany it. You essentially get two meals in one!

For breakfast, I ordered a simple sausage, egg, and cheese on a kaiser roll. Meat/egg to bread ratio was way off (way too much bread, only one sausage link/one egg). I don't think I have ever had a breakfast sandwich with sliced sausage link in it before and while it wasn't bad tasting, I expected a bit more of it. The egg and cheese in the sandwich was surprisingly good and the kaiser roll was average. The breakfast sandwich itself was a tad overpriced at nearly $5.50. For lunch, I came here and ordered the traditional turkey, mozzarella, arugula, and roast pepper sandwich on a sub roll. Everything was fresh, delicious and satisfying. Overall, this place is good.

Rosticeria Da Gigi is a small spot that specializes in freshly made breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant is 70% kitchen and 30% eating space, with a total of about 7 little tables and some counter bar stools.  There is outdoor dining and the manager hopes to continue outdoor seating with heaters during the colder months. The biggest attraction of this small spot is the freshness of the food and the reasonable prices.The temptation of small places with big menus is to lean on frozen foods, and Gigi is the opposite of that.  Everything from meatballs, pastas, stuffed peppers, steak sandwiches, etc, has a fresh look and taste to it.   Although some of the flavor and taste of the food does not hit the five star mark for me, I'm very comfortable giving a four star plus rating.Gigi has delivery, and it's very good delivery, including patient, polite phone service and quick delivery times.  Likewise, the service inside the restaurant is super-nice and professional.

On to the food.  Today was my first visit, and I just got something simple, an egg sandwich, which was quite good.  Flavorful ham, egg and cheese, served on a super-fresh brioche roll.  I ordered the egg over, and it was cooked perfectly.  Not flash cooked, diner-style, so that it came out fast but tough.  No, this was cooked slower, so that it was thick, fluffy and sumptuous.  A small detail, but telling, of a kitchen that knows what it's doing.Normally I wouldn't write a review after just one visit, but I have a good feeling about this place, and I expect good things to come.  It already has the feel of a friendly neighborhood joint, and Mark (one of the partners) helps to make everyone feel at home.  Can't wait 'til they're fully up and running, and will update once I've had the chance to sample more.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Although I was a little disappointed that the breakfast/brunch menu did not have a whole lot in terms of variety, I was very impressed by the quality of the food I ordered: a toasted croissant with egg whites, served with a side of crisp bacon. The egg whites were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the bacon was lick-your-fingers good (no greasy puddles or oil stains on the plate). My boyfriend had the corned beef hash with eggs, which he thought were good (he called it ""standard brunch/breakfast fare done well"").Our server was very nice and gave us plenty of time to finish our meals. Not a huge fan of the interior (kinda small), but I bet it's a great place to stop in for a quick pick-me-up during the morning rush hour.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We have gone too long without it.So, the lobster roll was delicate, if not a bit meager on a fresh, brioche bun. People from Maine would consider it an ""amuse bouche"".  But here in Hoboken, we might be more inclined to just express gratitude for the presence of actual lobster meat, and not that polyurethane, virtual seafood, corrupting salad bars across America. Along with this, I ordered food for my soon to arrive Thanksgiving, house guests, including the pappardelle bolognese,  (surprisingly bland), some kind of ziti with vodka sauce,an eggplant parm sandwich, along with a chicken parm sandwich.

The food is so fresh and the menu selection is second to none in terms of a gourmet deli. Whereas alot of the Italian delis in Hoboken sell what you would expect at an Italian deli, Gigi raises the bar by selling a wide variety of gourmet that isn't just Italian. When it comes to a great sandwich or salad or pasta, the possibilities are pretty much limitless here. They offer just about everything and it's all homemade and delicious. Even the stuff that's not healthy tastes healthy for you. I never leave here feeling bloated or unsatisfied--only nourished and content. I love this place and hope it stays around forever. It's nice to see a small local food business sprout up on Washington and offer great homestyle food. We need to keep supporting places like this so we're not just overrun by Subway and Starbucks and bars with mediocre burgers and wings in this town.

If you're a regular here, definitely introduce yourself to the owner. He is a great, friendly guy who always chats with me, and will remember you everytime you're there. The food is great, has high quality ingredients, made fresh, and always tastes delicious. I could literally eat here any meal of the day and be more than satisfied. Considering my personal stomach issues, I am forced to eat on the healthier side. They have many gluten free options and it's not hard to order anything healthy. The roasted meats with two sides are a great dinner option for only 12 dollars! Breakfast is also amazing! Pancakes, omelette's, oatmeal, French toast are all great. The desert's are just as good.

I called to order a Panini for delivery and was told I needed to add on something else to get to the $10 minimum to get it delivered even though it is a $2 dollar delivery charge but whatever. So I ordered a can of soda and when he came to deliver it first of all they went to the wrong apartment and he wasn't even there when he was calling me saying that he was there. Second of all the guy came and I had a $20 bill that I gave him for my total which was about $12. He handed me back a $5 and says that he doesn't have any more change to give me. He kept asking me if I had change and I didn't and he actually suggested I go across the street to the ATM to get change. (Which wouldn't have even helped in this situation) So I call the store and try to tell someone that I did not get my can of soda and that the delivery guy did not have the change for me and all she did was mock me and say ""what do you want me to do I am working here by myself"" and kept asking me over and over again what I did not receive in the order. Every time I answered her and said I did not receive my can of soda and also did not receive the proper amount of change she mocked me and just said ""so you're calling here for $2?"" I will not be dining with them again. What kind of business operates like that? I understand it's only a can of soda but I also didn't get proper change to basically I ended up paying $15 for a $8 panini. How is that not a good reason to call and ask for my money back?

We ate there or had delivery at least three times a week.But tonight was our last time. The service and quality of food has gone down hill. There's usually something wrong with the delivery orders and the staff became increasing irritated each time we'd call about it.The owner, Mark is a wonderful guy, but we haven't seen him around for a long time. I was told that he's taken a leave. I hope he's okay, but I'm afraid his business is really suffering without his presence.Yesterday, I went to the restaurant around 4p and ordered take out. I noticed that I was over-charged alittle but let it go and left a 20% tip.When I got home and opened the bag of food, I discovered it was wrong and found no salad dressing or bread. The food which we usually order, tasted bland like the ingredients are different.Tonight we reluctantly ordered delivery from them again, hoping for some sign of the old standards. However, screwed up our address and food order.The delivery person told us to call the restaurant. We did and spoke with Brianna, who said it was our fault that we received tiramisu for dinner instead of tortellini soup and if we still wanted the soup we'd have to pay for both. We said never mind if you're content to lose us as customers, we'll part ways now. A few minutes later we received a voice message from Brianna ranting that it was our fault and we would have to pay for the soup. Our door bell rang five minutes later and the delivery person handed us our soup and salad dressing. He just shook his head in frustration knowing how many times he has delivered to us over the pass year and embarrassed about so many screwed up orders.Apparently the delivery person insisted that they correct the order and deliver it no charge. Brianna did not want to do it, so she decided to leave us a nasty voicemail.We're sad to lose this place, but the situation has gotten so bad that we can't deal with it anymore.

Oh and don't forget to go look at all the sides they have there on display.  We ended up getting a quinoa stuffed red pepper which was perfect.  This place will no doubt become a Hoboken institution.  Customers, even new ones like us, are treated like family.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The croque madame was good; they kept the egg separate to maintain the integrity of the egg although I guess it was a weird thing to order as take out.  The farro was tasty and the Bolognese was really good! I was very impressed with the quality of the food for the price.  The take out arrived very speedily as well.  I would definitely eat here again to try some of their other sandwiches and pastas.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

133,qsRZm9OkmbR7YsYV5PpdmQ,Chip T.,4.0 star rating,"Rosticeria da Gigi, a name steeped in tradition and excellence, draws from a veritable wealth of classical elegance matched with hardwood flooring expertise. Too often labeled as an homage to Ben Affleck's theatric pinnacle in ""Gigli,"" the name derives it's true essence from founder, and purveyor of Thai-amalan cuisine, Will Smith. His chart topping bacon-baster, ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It,"" serves as the beloved Thai-amalan national anthem. (Jiggy = Gigli in Thai-amalan) His seminal roles in films such as Wild, Wild West and his Academy Award-winning performance in Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke afforded him perspective on both cultures. Because, let's face it, Guatemalan food is the exact same thing as Mexican food. This unique cultural heritage shines both on the walls and on the page turner that is Gigi's 100% corrugated-cardboard menu. Laden with enticing offerings, powerful aromas from the cucina sweep you back to the days before your Thai-amalan independence. The caramelized 3-D Doritos served in a French Toast Crunch-encrusted cucumber bowl delight the palette and puzzle the senses. What to make of a world where puppies sit in high-chairs and Jayden is the only waiter? These are the questions posed when one opens the doors to the hallowed grounds of the former Míami. In a city oversaturated with Thai-amalan cuisine, Rosticeria da Gigi stands as a beacon of hope for the people  of this once proud nation and the icon they so dearly love.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I am so glad we did, everything we had was absolutely delicious and very high quality. It is also very cheap, it's BYOB which is great too. We had meatloaf, rigatoni with spicy sausages, grilled shrimp, everything was very very good. They make their own mozzarella which was 'to-die-for'. Also people who work there are extremely friendly.

We also got the tortellini salad and lemonade. All around goodness. It was so good, we came back and got the same exact sandwich the next day. What can I say? We're creatures of habit.

Great quality foods, and for what they charge it's a steal. The roasted meats are really amazing and this is the only place I've found so far where roasted turkey in delicious gravy (just like at Thanksgiving) can be ordered year-round. They offer a wide array of sides which are all very good too. I would take the fact that they appear to specialize in Italian with a grain of salt, since if I were looking for real, authentic Italian there might be other places that would come to mind first over Rosticeria..although the Italian I have had from there is great, for some reason I don't think of them as an Italian place...For me, their sweet spot is really the homestyle meats and sides. Some offerings are a bit too lightly-seasoned for my own tastes, but for most people this is probably normal.. It's probably for the better, since you can just add your own salt and pepper later.",Rosticeria Da Gigi,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Gigi offers good Italian food made with care. I ordered delivery. It took fifteen min more than the estimate but you get a great value for the price- lots of things come with very ample side dishes. My husband had a generous portion of penne vodka with a delish side of mutz and tomatoes. I had the eggplant parm and broccoli rabe. Very fresh rabe and not bitter in the least. Loved the eggplant too. Very solid. Overall good meal, good value. One suggestion - both dishes were just a touch heavy on the salt but nothing terrible. What a great addition to town!
