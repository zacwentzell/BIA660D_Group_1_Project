They tasted spongy and as if they had been sitting in water. Just horrible. Pancakes - the actual pancakes were alright and the whipped cream was good, but they didn't even bring out syrup. Then, they brought out a small plastic takeout version that was completely solid when opened. Solid syrup. They were also supposed to come with choice of bacon, sausage, etc which was forgotten, so we had to ask for it.I honestly could have given this one star, but I've been for dinner years ago and had a good burger, so I feel the potential is still there, but man has this place gone downhill.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

Our server was friendly and attentive, the food tasted fresh and had flavor, but there was nothing outstanding about HBK bar & grill to me personally.We ordered cheeseburger sliders w/fries and the spicy short rib tacos along with mozzarella stix.It was all good to be honest, the burgers were juicy, they even toasted the buns, the fries were crunchy and the short ribs tacos had really tender meat that made them quite delicious. The mozzarella stix were good when they first came out but we didnt eat them right away and they quickly become a little hard.I assume this spot is known more their drinks and the food is just something else to add.

I would give this place one star but I am giving it two stars because they have a delicious lychee martini.

Ive seen people complain but dont listen to those reviews, the best times to go is Wednesday 4 the wings, Thursdays for the chill relaxed atmosphere, Friday and Saturday 4 the night life obviously and ofcourse Sunday 4 all day football. If your looking for good music, a very good beer list, fine cocktails and alot of tvs, this place is it. Really relaxing and also has a late night menu. The wings are amazing!!!! Yummmmmm!

I had been once before for quick drinks after work (although, I am not sure if I even had a drink). I was excited to try food there as I have passed by and seen the menu and specials a zillion times since it has opened.We went for a late enough lunch, catching the brunchy drink specials like $7 frozen pina coladas, $8 margaritas and $3 fuzzy navels, before 4 pm. I had the pina colada and it was absolutely delicious. I am a sucker for sweet and tropical drinks, so this was great; sweet and just strong enough to enjoy outside. The frozen margarita was pretty decent too--tangy.I ordered the Strawberry Fields Salad, which was a bed of mixed greens, topped with meaty pecans, plump strawberries, tart green apples, and tangy blue cheese. I opted for the chicken add-on, and I am so glad I did. Not only was the chicken juicy and flavorful, but the salad was pretty whimpy. There were maybe a total of four pieces of strawberry (which probably adds up to two strawberries), four slices of apple, and just two healthy handfuls of lettuce. The chicken made the salad more substantial, but I was still a little hungry after.My boyfriend ordered one of the brunch items; he got the breakfast burrito. It was a flour tortilla filled with seasoned scrambled eggs, with fatty chorizo, tomatoes, cheese and big black beans. It was pretty good, but also on the small side. The mix of elements was pretty decent and a little spicy. The substituted sweet potato fries were also delicious, crunchy and just right, especially with the honey mustard.The service was super great. The hostess was quick and our server was really attentive and friendly. I can see myself going back to eat there, because I spied some of their regular fries and they looked delicious.

I am still a #teamchefjason but #jasonthemanager is undoubtedly an awesome guy. I took it upon myself two and a half months ago to smash Hoboken Bar and Grill into the ground since it didn't do what it could to hold onto the Mexican culinary artist, Jason. I was very upset and had to go through intensive therapy and counseling to get over this loss. Last night I walked by Hoboken Bar and Grill and immediately noticed the place had not changed at all. Still the same place. The wait staff is very friendly, as is Jason the Manager. He seemed a bit deterred by my August 2013 review and I just told him what was what and that it was nothing personal. Supposedly the owner has a few words he'd like to share with me. I personally don't think he has the upper hand since he made a poor decision to rid the menu of Sinatra Skins. Now I have STILL not yet had the food at HBG. However, the service and overall atmosphere was pleasant and I had a great time drinking there. That is why I confidently bump up your rating from 3 to 4 stars. The only reason I am not feeling a hundred percent confident in giving you guys the 5 stars you deserve is the lack of Sinatra Skins on the menu. I personally went home in disgust and punched my own bathroom mirror until the glass shattered. With a bloody first I screamed in agony due to the agonizing absence of the once famous Sinatra Skins. I urge you to bring them back as it is the only item on the menu that can save your establishment. If you don't name them after Frank Sinatra, at least name them after me as I have been adamant about this topic for years. I wish you guys the best of luck and will probably see you tonight.

D.,2.0 star rating,"I visited Hoboken Bar and Grill today for the first time for lunch, and I must say that my first impression was horrible.  We were a group of 8, and everything started off fine with our server quickly seating us outside as we requested.  He brought waters right away, and we also ordered our meals quickly.Our first complaint was that the food took FOREVER to arrive.  We waited approximately 40-45 minutes.  We did ask our server during those 45 minutes for an update on the food several times, and he just kept saying it was on the way.When it finally arrived, 5 of our 8 meals looked great.  However, the other 3 of us had ordered the grilled cheese and tomato lunch special, but this dish was just pitiful... no other way to describe it!  I was one of the people who ordered the grilled cheese, and I have to say I was completely disappointed.  The sandwich came out on regular white bread (think white Wonder Bread), with only 2 slices of what tasted like Kraft cheese (the kind from individual wrappers... gross!), and one thin slice of tomato for the whole sandwich.  The bread wasn't even buttery or crisp.  All 3 of us barely touched the sandwich and just ate the side it came with.  We also noticed that a woman at the next table had ordered it also, and simply left it on her plate untouched.We did mention this to the waiter, and he apologized numerous times (it wasn't his fault, and he was very nice about it).  He even commented, ""How do you even mess up grilled cheese?""  We agreed!  He offered to take the sandwiches off of the bill, but somehow in the shuffle, it never happened.  Either way, with so many great food choices in Hoboken, I doubt we will be back to Hoboken Bar and Grill.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

I recently went for lunch on Saturday and had my worst experience in a while. When we got there it was certainly not crowded. We were seated and no one came to our table for nearly 10 minutes. We watched our waitress-to-be walk by about 5 times without even making eye contact. Finally she came over and I asked where the ""full"" menu was. She said they only had this reduced menu since they got a new chef. Needless to say the item I wanted (HBG burger) wasn't on this new menu so I got sliders and a beer. The food took at least a half hour to come, probably longer and we had to ask a few times where it was. When it came the sliders were bland and over cooked. All that waiting for garbage food.

To charge people $3 for a refill on soda or soda water, c'mon, this place hasn't earned the right to do that, you're not fine dining, anything but. The second time I went it was with a group of people and this blew their mind. The fact that there was hardly anyone in there they still couldn't get us drinks or food in a timely fashion. It was a mess. Watching the waitress do simple addition on our bill was like watching a 5 year old try to do calculus.

However, regarding the drinks, I tried their regular Margarita, and it was plain awful. It was not sweet nor strong, but tasted more like melted ice than anything else. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing and should have just stuck to a regular beer, but I would avoid the lime Margaritas. Decor of this place is also generic and rather unexciting.

I came to eat at this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with 2 friends. We arrived at 3:40pm and were sat at a table by the hostess immediately. 20 minutes passed and a waiter was yet to be assigned to us. I thought it to be a honest mistake so I got up and politely asked for a waitress. The woman said, ""Sure I'll take your order right now"". She then took our entire order (drinks and food). She came back 2 mins later with our beers. After receiving our beers, an entire 30 minutes passed with none of our ordered food arriving(including the appetizer I ordered). At 430pm, a completely different waitress comes up to us and asks, ""hey you guys want more drinks? And can you also repeat your food order?"" We repeated our order to her thinking our food was ready and she just wanted to bring the right food up. Another 10 minutes passed so I got up and asked to speak to a manager. I don't know the managers name so I can only describe him. Caucasian, about 5'7, a little under 400 pounds. Can't miss him. The manager asked what was wrong. I told him I had to ask for a waitress, 2 separate waitresses, then took our order, and we've been waiting for our food for 1 hour. He said, ""After 4pm there's no hostess so you sit yourself and have to get your own waitress"". I told him we arrived well before 4pm.

Don't worry about the drinks just get the F*** out."" I told him check the cameras and he said he did already and I was wrong to just ""get the F out of his restaurant"". Completely unprofessional.

We ordered the Spinach and Crab dip and since one of our friends does not like seafood, we were able to order the crab on the side. Very accommodating. The dip was absolutely delicious.

When he told the waitress, she offered to get him a new one.  When my husband said he doesn't like to return food because he doesn't know what they'll do, she smiled and said, ""Sorry"".  (The reason he didn't return it was also because the service was so slow and we couldn't linger there with a newborn.)  My grilled chicken wrap was missing the avocado and the chicken was burnt.  Then our newborn started to get cranky, cry and needed to be changed.  My husband had to change him on boxes downstairs while a camera crew took up all the tables.  As he finished, someone told him that there was a changing table upstairs.  This bathroom upstairs is labeled ""Private"".  During this time, someone who worked there offered us a free dessert.  I just wanted to get the check and leave so she said that if I ever want to come back and get dessert, I should let her know.   Overall, we've given HBG many chances because we used to frequent it for years.  But after getting poor service, a strange response to inedible food (dessert?) and a lack of sensitivity towards a family with a newborn, we will take our business elsewhere.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

I thought to myself - wow, that's a pricey fish sandwich, especially since Tilapia is the least expensive fish at the market. For $16, it should be pretty rockin'. The $16 Fish Sandwich is a sign of the times i fear. It was honestly worth half that much. Way too much bread (a long soft french roll), and too little fish. It just didn't work. By the end of each half, i was eating all bread and fixings.

I flagged down another waitress during our wait asking for a mojito, a drink that was on special.

So I think our server got the hint and begged the manager to take it off, which they finally obliged.  We gave our server a nice tip because she did a good job.  Bottom line - food is ok, service was good, but management is poor.  When are these places going to realize that return and referred customers are your bread and butter?",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

I'd have to say that in my life I don't think I've had better. I've been to Pats & Gino's in Philly many times and they're decent but overrated. Go there sober during the day and see. Phillys Cheesesteaks by 6th & Wash is total, utter, garbage. So back to here......the bread was insanely tasty and perfectly textured, the meat was nicely seasoned (maybe a touch more pepper if i'm being picky) and very tender and the amount of peppers, onions, and cheese was perfect. No one flavor took over the sandwich which was nice. $12 is a tad high for a lunch sandwich but I'm ok with it since the quality was equally high. Bonus - put the great french fries on the sandwich for some crunch!!

One of those is....if your bathroom is THAT dirty, there is no way that your kitchen is all that clean. I've visited Hoboken Bar & Grill twice now. The first time we went, ordered mostly beers and split some sliders. The sliders were not very good. Instead of being burger-ish they fell more to Meatloaf-ish. I hate burgers that taste like meatloaf. Any way, they screwed up the bill and forgot to charge us the happy hour prices for the sliders, but we got it fixed and moved on with our lives. The second time we went, I had one of those 'ah ha' moments of ""Oh Crap this is the place with the meatloaf sliders and the not so clean bathrooms."" I would have walked right out the door but I was with a group of 8 other people. We got nacho's, potato skins, some salads and burgers. Somehow when the waitress put in our order she ordered my husband three burgers, with mushrooms and mayo on the side. It was kind of funny when they came out, but not when they showed up on our bill. They fixed it, but 2 for 2 on screwing up the bill. Also - the bathrooms are atrocious.  You take those two tiny steps and you get hit with a wall of nastyness. At the time we were there one of each of the men/women bathrooms was clogged into oblivion. The one per that weren't were also beyond gross. I can only imagine how many violations there kitchen has. I will never forget the name of this place ever again and I can guarantee I will never step foot in this place. On a side note, while waiting for our table, another sign of the nastiness was when we ordered sangria.

214,X9G0xSZhkKo0KwyInr6CMg,A C.,3.0 star rating,"The food is ok, but the service is awful. Met some friends here for dinner. We were a larger group so we made a reservation. I was greeted by a ""hostess"" who gruffly told us to go downstairs, only for us to find no waitstaff downstairs whatsoever. After tracking down our waitress and finding our table, the waitress came back to us all of three times - to take our order, order more drinks and bring our bill. The food took forever to come out, and was missing some sides when it finally arrived. Multiple times members from our party looked around for the waitress and we couldn't find her. When we finally for the check we had to deliver it to her, because she was too busy texting behind the service station. Again, food was ok but not nearly good enough to compensate for the awful service. We will not be back.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

They said, hey, there's a girl that's having a bday party with open bar...you know how that goes could be a bust but we'll check it out...you never know with open bar right? So we get there and the whole downstairs room is booked. We pay a guy $20 and get a bracelet on our way downstairs, we get a seat, hang out...open bar is meant to start at 9:30...we're getting ready to pounce cause...you know...it might run out or something. A line forms, we get up there, the guy says sure grab two drinks at a time! sweet. good start. we sit down start drinking, go up for more, 2 more drinks or a pitcher? a pitcher?! um sure, yes please. we sit back down continue drinking. over comes a lovely young man with a lovely platter of lovely appetizer selections. grilled shrimp on a stick, steak on a stick, chicken, wings. and the sauces...mmm the sauces. sounds good. more drinks, more pitchers. 30 min later, another app platter (we're all cheering cause this is awesome). we think thats it, so we continue drinking...another 30 min later, ANOTHER app platter. yes ladies and gentlemen, another. and they were good and we devoured every little piece of delicious food on those three platters. plus the 5 pitchers at our table and the numerous double fistable cocktails. all for 20 fricken dollars. by 2 AM, (yes we are still going at this point!) i decide i have to find the owner and ask him how the hell this awesome night is happening and he is still in business. he was wonderful and happy we were having a good time. so were we. i want to have every party here ever.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"
216,JAlVWWg8fI_ozAO43Wm8Ag,Alyssa B.,1.0 star rating,"I ate here a few nights ago and was again, very satisfied with the food, but it seems the service is getting worse! I had a nice-looking young man, but who seemed more interested in hanging out with the hostess then tending to the table. I saw him only 3 times- once to take our drink orders, once to drop them off/take our dinner order and again to ""ask if we wanted dessert"" yet was fully prepared with the bill.And why is it okay for him to stick the bill/server ""folder"" in the back of his pants? I don't want to touch that! He served our drinks, which were all wet because he apparently had spilled them on the way over and then didn't give us napkins and/or utensils. Never stopped by to ask how our food was or even get us another round of drinks.This young man needs a reminder of what his role and responsibilities are. The food and environment are great but the service is getting increasingly poor. Unfortunately, I will no longer recommend this to friends or out-of-town relatives.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"

They don't care about the customer's satisfaction. They can't be flexible with the so called ""house rules"". No mater how many people you are, all of you have to order at least one entree to get your ass on chairs with tables. Otherwise you have to sit on the bar and I bet you'll find place for all if you are more than two. I hate this place from bottom of my heart from my first visit itself. Never going back again. I feel the staff is bitchy and racist, too.",Hoboken Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Sports, Bars,, Burgers"
