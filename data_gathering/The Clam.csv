If you're not a huge seafood fan, yhis place is still for you as they offer cocktails, salads, starters, perfectly made pastas, etc.We started out with some items from the raw bar including oysters, clam and jumbo gulf shrimp! Fresh and delicious! The Crudités and Mignonette sauce was awesome! We also had some polenta with sweet Roma tomato sauce. The polenta was crispy on the outside and succulently soft on the inside. It was perfect!The salad was filling, healthy and quite flavorful. For my main dish i enjoyed the lobster and clam sliders and my boyfriend loved the spicy spaghetti with clams. We were too full to order anything more. We even skipped dinner later on! If you're looking for hearty seafood dishes look no further. The Clam is chique and delicious.

1,EYmljXzTUytC1XPF51NLCA,Justin C.,4.0 star rating,"A local hotspot hidden in the endless confusing streets of the West Village that has that flare you would expect from a moderately high end seafood spot. The atmosphere is very casual and nothing pretentious about it except for maybe the prices, even though the food had no short comings, it is slightly on the high side. Aside from that, this place is great, from the service to the overall experience, it's a solid choice to get your seafood fix. Their famous clam dip is a easy favorite appy to order. Creamy with a bit of a chew from the clams, but not quite as ""clammy"" as I was hoping for. It was good, but felt like it could've used a more ocean briny kick to it to bring out the clam flavor a bit more, but solid nonetheless. The butternut squash apple salad was a pleasant surprise with a very balanced blend of bitter, sweet, sour, and savory, not to mention how aesthetically pleasing it was with the watermelon radishes. The steamers were a bit small but very fresh, these are hard little suckers to find nowadays, so fresh is all I could ask for and they were. The clam pizza was okay, it definitely could've been better but pizza is hard to mess up. My favorite was the lobster and fried clam sliders, although very small, they pack quite a party in your mouth. If you're a textural kinda person, these are a must try. Plump fresh lobster mixed with freshly fried clam strips...this can easily be listed as an aphrodisiac. The chocolate cake spiked with a 1000(slightly exaggerated) proof liquor, crazy bold, crazy flavors, crazy good if you're an alcoholic like me. Overall, this place won't disappoint for sure. It's got the quality of a fine dining experience minus the pretentious atmosphere. It hits the right spots and it was enjoyable to the very end.

2,VWdGN2vPqVgCCuq7y8M82w,Teresa C.,4.0 star rating,"This was very close to a 5* experience for me. My bf took me here for my birthday. I'm a seafood lover and found this place because I was looking for steamer clams or whole belly clams. We got a 9:30 rez on the same day, but tried going earlier around 7:30 and was able to get a table right away. Both the hostess and waiter were very attentive and professional. The ambiance was dark and romantic with candles and twinkly lights everywhere. We got a bottle of white wine from Greece (it was the cheapest one at $52). We ordered the clam dip, butternut squash and honey crisp apple salad, the clam and lobster sliders, steamers, and the clam pizza. The clam dip was good, but could've used more of a briny taste or bigger clams. The clams tasted canned, but I still enjoyed it, especially the house fried potato chips. The salad might've been the BEST salad I've had in my entire salad eating life. It was a perfect blend of sweet, acidic, savory, and bitter. It had butternut squash, apples, grapes, radicchio, frisée, shaved cauliflower, and chunks of aged cheddar in a champagne vinaigrette. They even split it for us on separate plates. The steamers were heaven. The prices have soared for steamers and it's so hard to find fresh ones that aren't sandy or rotten tasting, but these were very fresh. The lobster and fried clam sliders were perfection. The juxtaposition of the hot, crunchy clams, and the chilled, sweet lobster was like unicorn food. I loved the different textures in one sandwich. I just wish they were bigger or less pricey. The clam pizza was probably my least favorite. The clams got a bit chewy in the cooking process and lost their juicyness. We also got the chocolate cake that must've been spiked with half a bottle of liquor. It felt like I was taking a shot with every bite, in a good way! I respect how bold the chef was about the liquor. All in all, a solid 4.5* meal and I'd definitely return!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

Aside from the portions being small, the scallop appetizer was delicious, as was the black Sea bass. I ordered the lobster and leek ravioli, which is just one big ravioli, and that was good, not great. Our server started off good but it quickly went down hill. He clearly had to finish his side work and did not check in with us while we waited a very long time for our entrees. The kitchen was full of workers and there were only two tables, including my mom and i. I work in the industry, so I simply don't have tolerance for bad service. We probably would have spent more, had the server done more. My mom asked for bread since the place does not offer bread, and that also was a task.

11,bzv6R1JQc95WX13b96IP8g,Joy Y.,4.0 star rating,"It goes without saying that you should not bring someone here if they don't like clams. I thoroughly enjoyed the clam dip. Before coming here, I assumed it would come in a skillet like a spinach dip. Instead, it is served cold like a seafood salad but thinner and with clams. The only thing similar I have had in the past was an amberjack pate by the beach somewhere in the south. A more commonly pleasing dish was their take on spaghetti alla vongole with spicy tomato sauce, which was al dente and extremely satisfying without any use of dairy. The whole fish was disappointingly overcooked and bland, even with the really tasty escarole as garnish.Cooking is overall simple and straightforward - can't say I've been to any other restaurant where the ""Sides"" section only consists of garnishes in entrees. Not sure if it's a lack of effort or a mindset to keep it simple. The Clam seems like a quintessential neighborhood darling that I will never frequent, but will keep recommending to anyone on the hunt for a seafood restaurant.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood
12,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"The Clam, a cutesy corner property on the edge of the West Village, has no shortage of strong dishes. Though, it does help if you are a fan of the mollusk in its moniker in the first place. (Thank you, Captain Obvious.)There are the shared plates:- Both The Clam Dip (zesty potato chips) and Grilled White Clam Pizza (pickled hot peppers, whipped ricotta, Parmesan) are solid apps, and good gateway dishes to bolder fare.There are the veggie sides:- These rotate seasonally, but if you catch the Crispy Butternut Squash Risotto Balls (pumpkin seed salsa verde) or Sriracha Roasted Brussels Sprouts (peanuts, bacon) on the menu, they're certainly worth the order.And there are the pastas:- The Maine Lobster & Leek Raviolo (shellfish nage, tarragon) is nice and light and lunch-worthy (note, the ""o"", and not an ""i"", at the end of ""raviolo"", is singular, as in one giant pasta pocket, and not multiple ravioli). But the Spaghetti & Clams (tomato, salad on top) is a wonderfully simple dish, super satisfying and slightly spicy. Still, after visiting a handful of times, sampling all the aforementioned items, and that Spaghetti & Clams coming awfully close, I was still in search of a signature dish.Enter the Fried Clam & Lobster Sliders.Some nautical-themed restaurants in NYC will try to tap into comfort food feels with a basket of fried clams. Most seafood-leaning spots here are going to compete for lobster roll supremacy the same way any big city competes for burger bragging rights. But in a town where sandwiches are constantly trying to out-sandwich one another, these sliders seriously stand out. The Clam successfully bridges the best of both worlds between two pairs of griddled buns that each stack two subaqueous favorites for something shockingly unique. In other words, why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Every bite goes from soft buttery roll to crunchy clam strips to creamy lobster bits back to soft buttery roll again, resulting in max seafood sammy bliss.Go clam crazy and order everything if you've got the crew and/or appetite, but make sure to save room for these two mini-sandwiches. The intersection of casual comfort fare and classier seafood favorites seems to be The Clam's sweet spot, and no dish represents that better than these tremendous Fried Clam & Lobster Sliders.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

While our waitress was very nice and the service prompt, our appetizers and our entrees left much to be desired. Aside from the fact that from a flavor perspective our dishes were totally boring, we were more frustrated with the portion sizes when the entrees came out. My portion of Monkfish fish was maybe 4 oz total (and was so over cooked I could bounce it off the floor), and my boyfriends sliders were definitely an appetizer portion, despite him specifically asking in advance whether they should be ordered as an app or an entree (she assured entree). For $120 we both left starving. This place seems like it has fresh ingredients to work with but simply did not deliver.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

17,7T_CyLVkvk4O00hF_wuYoQ,Saul G.,4.0 star rating,"A place that might merit five stars, but you will have to decide if the value is there.We began with beverages, a well executed (if pricey) Bloody Mary for me, a glass of the house (Finger Lakes)  Riesling for my wife, and an iced coffee for the feinschmecker. The waiter was kind enough to bring tastes of the house Riesling and a German offering for comparison.Next up, the clam dip with house chips. This was a generous portion. The creamy dip was delicious, the large potato chips perfectly done and addicting. Our other appetizer was the ""Campechana Coctel de Camaron"" a sort of escabeche of shrimp, avocado and tomato. The Clam serves tortilla chips with this one. It's a successful dish, but loses out in a comparison with the superb clam dip. I'm thinking the risotto balls might work as a companion starter.The feinschmecker plumped for the sublime Parker House rolls - warm and sweet they were better than the ones I had at the Boston source. But should I have to pay $1.50 each for rolls when ordering a complete meal and drinks?My wife's halibut was a decent portion of perfectly cooked, beautifully presented fresh fish. I have no qualms about the price of this one, halibut is an expensive item. The feinschmecker's steamers were on point, but the portion was smaller than you'd get out East or down East. I went with the clam/lobster sliders. This comprised two small sandwiches of nicely executed fried clam strips over lobster salad. Rich and delicious. But the two rounds looked naked on the large plate. A pickle, cole slaw, something fresh and acidic (a tomato slice) would have elevated this dish. Oh, to hope the Clam decides to fry up some whole clams with bellies, that would be glorious.Don't leave town without some of that sauteed escarole with raisins, it's excellent.Overall, we certainly enjoyed this meal.

This quint little restaurant on a corner in the West Village left quite an impression on me. Thankfully, it was all for the right reasons.First of all, once you step through the front door, the wonderful aroma coming from the open kitchen felt so welcoming. Then, walking into the restaurant's charming dining room with dark lit lights and small candles on each table made us feel warm and cozy.The hostess was very friendly and made sure we were seated by the window as we had requested, but still somewhat warm with a heater nearby. Our server was also very kind and patient as we took some time deciding and asking for recommendations due to many delicious options.Speaking of the delectable food, everything hit the perfect note. We had half a dozen Little Neck Clams and Royal Miyagi Oysters to start. They were both definitely some of the freshest bivalves we've ever had. We also ordered the Clam Dip as an extra app, and boy was it good! Chunky pieces of chopped up clams mixed into a creamy dip that uses large potato chips as your vehicle for shoveling all that deliciousness into your mouth. For entrees, we had Clam Chowder and Skate Wing, which were both outstanding. The soup was not overly creamy but down right awesome, while the skate had a brown butter sauce with pancetta and leeks. Talk about two off the charts good endings to our meal. On a no sugar diet, so no desserts.Honestly, I can't wait to go back next time and try more items on the menu.

The kitchen was full of workers and there were only two tables, including my mom and i. I work in the industry, so I simply don't have tolerance for bad service. We probably would have spent more, had the server done more. My mom asked for bread since the place does not offer bread, and that also was a task. Our service left immediately after we requested bread, which he did not announce to us. I got the check right away and got us the he'll out of there.

We decided to go for it with the surf and turf. Steak was perfectly cooked and we loved how they prepared the lobster so you didn't have to pick up or crack any shells. The buttery, herby sauce was out of control - I was putting it on everything. Our server was super friendly and seemed genuinely proud when we cleared all our plates.

31,bzv6R1JQc95WX13b96IP8g,Joy Y.,4.0 star rating,"It goes without saying that you should not bring someone here if they don't like clams. I thoroughly enjoyed the clam dip. Before coming here, I assumed it would come in a skillet like a spinach dip. Instead, it is served cold like a seafood salad but thinner and with clams. The only thing similar I have had in the past was an amberjack pate by the beach somewhere in the south. A more commonly pleasing dish was their take on spaghetti alla vongole with spicy tomato sauce, which was al dente and extremely satisfying without any use of dairy. The whole fish was disappointingly overcooked and bland, even with the really tasty escarole as garnish.Cooking is overall simple and straightforward - can't say I've been to any other restaurant where the ""Sides"" section only consists of garnishes in entrees. Not sure if it's a lack of effort or a mindset to keep it simple. The Clam seems like a quintessential neighborhood darling that I will never frequent, but will keep recommending to anyone on the hunt for a seafood restaurant.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood
32,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"The Clam, a cutesy corner property on the edge of the West Village, has no shortage of strong dishes. Though, it does help if you are a fan of the mollusk in its moniker in the first place. (Thank you, Captain Obvious.)There are the shared plates:- Both The Clam Dip (zesty potato chips) and Grilled White Clam Pizza (pickled hot peppers, whipped ricotta, Parmesan) are solid apps, and good gateway dishes to bolder fare.There are the veggie sides:- These rotate seasonally, but if you catch the Crispy Butternut Squash Risotto Balls (pumpkin seed salsa verde) or Sriracha Roasted Brussels Sprouts (peanuts, bacon) on the menu, they're certainly worth the order.And there are the pastas:- The Maine Lobster & Leek Raviolo (shellfish nage, tarragon) is nice and light and lunch-worthy (note, the ""o"", and not an ""i"", at the end of ""raviolo"", is singular, as in one giant pasta pocket, and not multiple ravioli). But the Spaghetti & Clams (tomato, salad on top) is a wonderfully simple dish, super satisfying and slightly spicy. Still, after visiting a handful of times, sampling all the aforementioned items, and that Spaghetti & Clams coming awfully close, I was still in search of a signature dish.Enter the Fried Clam & Lobster Sliders.Some nautical-themed restaurants in NYC will try to tap into comfort food feels with a basket of fried clams. Most seafood-leaning spots here are going to compete for lobster roll supremacy the same way any big city competes for burger bragging rights. But in a town where sandwiches are constantly trying to out-sandwich one another, these sliders seriously stand out. The Clam successfully bridges the best of both worlds between two pairs of griddled buns that each stack two subaqueous favorites for something shockingly unique. In other words, why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Every bite goes from soft buttery roll to crunchy clam strips to creamy lobster bits back to soft buttery roll again, resulting in max seafood sammy bliss.Go clam crazy and order everything if you've got the crew and/or appetite, but make sure to save room for these two mini-sandwiches. The intersection of casual comfort fare and classier seafood favorites seems to be The Clam's sweet spot, and no dish represents that better than these tremendous Fried Clam & Lobster Sliders.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

While our waitress was very nice and the service prompt, our appetizers and our entrees left much to be desired. Aside from the fact that from a flavor perspective our dishes were totally boring, we were more frustrated with the portion sizes when the entrees came out. My portion of Monkfish fish was maybe 4 oz total (and was so over cooked I could bounce it off the floor), and my boyfriends sliders were definitely an appetizer portion, despite him specifically asking in advance whether they should be ordered as an app or an entree (she assured entree).

37,7T_CyLVkvk4O00hF_wuYoQ,Saul G.,4.0 star rating,"A place that might merit five stars, but you will have to decide if the value is there.We began with beverages, a well executed (if pricey) Bloody Mary for me, a glass of the house (Finger Lakes)  Riesling for my wife, and an iced coffee for the feinschmecker. The waiter was kind enough to bring tastes of the house Riesling and a German offering for comparison.Next up, the clam dip with house chips. This was a generous portion. The creamy dip was delicious, the large potato chips perfectly done and addicting. Our other appetizer was the ""Campechana Coctel de Camaron"" a sort of escabeche of shrimp, avocado and tomato. The Clam serves tortilla chips with this one. It's a successful dish, but loses out in a comparison with the superb clam dip. I'm thinking the risotto balls might work as a companion starter.The feinschmecker plumped for the sublime Parker House rolls - warm and sweet they were better than the ones I had at the Boston source. But should I have to pay $1.50 each for rolls when ordering a complete meal and drinks?My wife's halibut was a decent portion of perfectly cooked, beautifully presented fresh fish. I have no qualms about the price of this one, halibut is an expensive item. The feinschmecker's steamers were on point, but the portion was smaller than you'd get out East or down East. I went with the clam/lobster sliders. This comprised two small sandwiches of nicely executed fried clam strips over lobster salad. Rich and delicious. But the two rounds looked naked on the large plate. A pickle, cole slaw, something fresh and acidic (a tomato slice) would have elevated this dish. Oh, to hope the Clam decides to fry up some whole clams with bellies, that would be glorious.Don't leave town without some of that sauteed escarole with raisins, it's excellent.Overall, we certainly enjoyed this meal.

This quint little restaurant on a corner in the West Village left quite an impression on me. Thankfully, it was all for the right reasons.First of all, once you step through the front door, the wonderful aroma coming from the open kitchen felt so welcoming. Then, walking into the restaurant's charming dining room with dark lit lights and small candles on each table made us feel warm and cozy.The hostess was very friendly and made sure we were seated by the window as we had requested, but still somewhat warm with a heater nearby. Our server was also very kind and patient as we took some time deciding and asking for recommendations due to many delicious options.Speaking of the delectable food, everything hit the perfect note. We had half a dozen Little Neck Clams and Royal Miyagi Oysters to start. They were both definitely some of the freshest bivalves we've ever had. We also ordered the Clam Dip as an extra app, and boy was it good! Chunky pieces of chopped up clams mixed into a creamy dip that uses large potato chips as your vehicle for shoveling all that deliciousness into your mouth. For entrees, we had Clam Chowder and Skate Wing, which were both outstanding. The soup was not overly creamy but down right awesome, while the skate had a brown butter sauce with pancetta and leeks. Talk about two off the charts good endings to our meal. On a no sugar diet, so no desserts.Honestly, I can't wait to go back next time and try more items on the menu.

The crunchy fried clams were delicious and goes well with the lobster. The break was toasted with nice thin layer of crunchiness. - stuffed clams: they were ok. It destroyed the clam taste for me. - Sriracha roasted Brussel sprouts with bacon: everything goes well with bacon and Sriracha :) - clam spaghetti: homemade pasta with bits of clams in the sauce.

Soft Shell Crabs - a below average dish, similar issue with the clam, the breading was way too thick and lacked in flavor.  The only redeeming quality of this dish was the accompanied asparagus, which had a really delicious sauce on top.Ginger Bread IC Sandwich - this was the table's favorite, but I personally thought the ginger cookie was too sweet, and I couldn't really discern the mascarpone flavor in the gelato.86 Proof Chocolate Icebox Cake - ironically I was the only one at the table who liked this dessert.  My friends didn't appreciate the strong taste of bourbon, but I liked it.  I also love the richness of the chocolate and the creaminess of the espresso chantilly (which sounded really fancy).Service was impeccable, our water never dipped below the half way point.  They didn't try to rush us even though it was a Sat night, and divided our entrees into equal portion when we informed them that we were sharing.  The ambiance is extremely romantic, definitely a great place to go for a date night.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

I can't deny that the Clam definitely had an enticing menu and offered some great selections, it's just that the service left us pretty disappointed and some of the things we ordered were okay. Saturday night I came with a group of friends. This was our first time dining here so we had questions about the menu; food portions, what's best to share, recommendations on what entrees to chose from, etc. When we were originally seated there was a sweet girl who took our drink orders and was super enthusiastic! However, our waitor who was to take our dinner order was much the opposite. Anytime we asked him a question it seemed like he was just giving us blank stares and delayed responses with a bare minimum response. Answering us with phrases like ""I think so"" is not sufficient. Aside from the mediocre service, the food was decent. Nothing I would write home about, but I did enjoy it. We ordered the east side and west side oysters along with clam dip for starters. Both of which were good. The chips that came with the clam dip were a little too salty for my liking however. We also ordered the clam chowder which was super underwhelming. Living in the northeast you expect clam chowder to be thick, creamy, and loaded with potatoes. The clam chowder here was on the watery side. Being the foodie I am I don't mind spending $, but $15 for watery clam chowder? No thanks! Also my final bone to pick with the clam is who the hell chargers for their bread/ bread rolls? Apparently it's a new policy they've implemented. My favorite thing here was the clam spaghetti. It's under ""house specials"" on the menu and it was delicious.

I've never had an issue with the service here but yesterday we were served by Allie S. I am not sure if she is new but I've never had her before. She is incredibly rude and it seemed like she could not be bothered to get us water or take our orders. When she finally came around to take our orders, I asked if my spaghetti could be more on the al dente side ( a request I make every time ,and was always accommodate. ) She rolled her eyes at me and very rudely said, We know how to cook pasta here and walked away. Even though she was extremely rude, I would've let it go if my spaghetti was al dente which I assure you it was not!!! During the rest of the meal, she maybe came by once to refill our water but never asked how our meal was or if we needed anything else. You could tell she was extremely annoyed and was rushing and her energy made us extremely uncomfortable. We usually get dessert and coffee but we opted not to this time since I was dying to leave because I felt so tense dining there.

But I decided today was the day I would take it out of the friend zone. Turns out, it's a pretty decent meal. The clam pizza, risotto balls, and lobster raviolo were the table's favorite appetizers. I did not think the clam dip lived up to the hype, but rather tasted like a cold, tasteless mush of clams. After deciding that I've had enough of ordering salmon everywhere I went, I tried the Sautéed Skate wing. It was a beautiful and fresh filet of a generous size. The fish was lightly floured to create a slight crisp, and the texture of the fish was perfectly tender. For the side dishes, I would be remiss if I didn't not mention the carrots. If carrots were this tasty when I was a kid, I probably wouldn't have secretly slid them onto other people's plate to avoid eating them so much. I also thoroughly enjoyed the green beans, dressed with feta and almonds. The kale was simple and sautéed, but still held its own. Despite being overwhelmingly full, it doesn't feel like a complete meal until you've ordered all the desserts (that's normal, right?) Out of the peach and blueberry crostata, the bourbon ice box, and ginger ice cream sandwich, we liked the homemade marscapone gelato the most. The buttermilk ice cream tastes exactly how it sounded--which was bland. (though the ginger ice cream was my favorite, no one else in the table shared that sentiment).",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

To start, we ordered the Clam Dip which came with zesty potato chips. The chips were a bit salty but the dip neutralized the saltiness. It was very creamy but it didn't taste like you were eating a pound of mayonnaise and the clams tasted fresh. As another appetizer, I ordered the Fried Clam and Lobster Sliders, my boyfriend was initially opposed but upon my persuasion, he tried and loved them. His was gone in .5 seconds, lol. I enjoyed them as well, the buns were toasted warm with the fried clam on top and fresh lobster in a creamy mixture underneath; perfect combination. For my meal, I ordered the Spaghetti and Clams (spicy tomato, salad on top) and my boyfriend had the Pan Cripsed Half Bell & Evans Chicken (polenta cake, stewed tomato, roasted mushroom pan sauce). We were both beyond satisfied with our meals. The S&C was remarkable, I mean, how often do you get clams in a red sauce that is flavoured, pasta cooked perfectly with enough clams in the dish, and piping hot when served?? How often?? I really couldn't believe how awesome my plate was. My boyfriend also enjoyed his meal, he mentioned the chicken being cooked to perfection. The chef definitely knows best, the polenta cake paired very well with the chicken and the mushroom sauce was unbelievable. Thank you to everyone at The Clam. We will definitely return for more! :D",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

We had the back table, away from all the other tables and this was great because we were able to actually TALK to each other and hear. So A+ for the ambiance. Service was very good too. No complaints.My main issue is the prices for what you get - and the food was ok. Some of it was very good - like the clam dip, but definitely not enough for the table to share. We each basically got one chip with dip (there were 6 of us) so probably should have gotten 2 orders. None of us went for the very pricey entrees which probably were amazing, so maybe that was our mistake. We stuck with lots of apps and sides - most of us got the lobster and clam sliders - one got the pizza - and we ordered a bunch of extras like the old bay fries and veggies. I had the clam chowder. Really chock full of clams - but not as creamy as I expected, and salty. So salty. The sliders cost a small fortune and basically had a small dollup of lobster. And SALTY. I really feel like for $28 for 2 small sliders - it should have come with fries. The fries were pleasantly seasoned but way too crispy for me. I like a little potato softness in my fry middle. And again, salty.The drinks were good but could have been $1-$2 cheaper. The desserts were good. I LOVED the 86 Proof Chocolate Icebox Cake - nice and bourbon-y.All in all a nice evening but none of the food blew me away and I probably won't make an effort to go back though I'd certainly try again if someone suggested going there. But all the hype- didn't live up to it for me.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

The corn appetizer was packed with flavor--one of the best corn dishes I've ever had!

He helped us pick a delicious wine with how descriptive and educated he was on the wine selection. After, we ordered the lobster raviolo to share. Very delicious and nice size chunks of lobster inside. For our main course, my friend got the swordfish. (Grilled perfectly,with a light vinaigrette). I got the stuffed clams. The stuffing was seasoned nicely and delicately with little tomatoes. My only issue was that the clams were overcooked and rubbery. (What a shame.)Regardless it was a nice dining experience.

70,7n3KrdZtgy5oSYgVh8Y69w,Erica L.,5.0 star rating,"Such wow. Much yum. Many good.Jokes aside, my dining experience was fantastic. I came here with my family, and it was a wonderful treat for us all. The restaurant is very dimly lit with candles on each table. The tables are draped with white tablecloths, and you can immediately feel the more upscale vibe when you walk in.We started with a bottle of white wine recommended by the sommelier to accompany our seafood meal and were each served warm housemade parker house rolls, which had generous amounts of butter and were light and fluffy. We ordered the house special clam chowder to start. The clam chowder was not your average cup of soup. It was presented with a few large clams in the shell swimming in the pool of soup, toppling with oyster crackers, bacon, and leeks. This proved to be a much more impressive display, and the taste was equally pleasing. The soup was not overwhelmed with potatoes and lumpy from globs of cream, as you might find in a diner, but rather was light but flavorful. Next, we had the stuffed clams with pancetta, trinity, lemon, and buttered crumbs. This was also a hit, as the pancetta and butter crumbs provided a nice textural contrast to the chewy clam. They were adorably served five to an order in the shell around a small salad of arugula and lemon. This was one of many highlights of the night.My family and I all ordered different fish dishes. After all, if you come to a seafood restaurant, you're not going to gravitate towards the chicken or steak. We ordered the roasted cauliflower with dried cranberries and sauteed kale with lemon, chili, & garlic as well. Everyone was raving about their respective entrees, and not a crumb was left.To end the meal on a sweet note, I ordered the ginger bread ic sandwich with mascarpone gelato & brown butter caramel. I'm a huge fan of gingerbread and ice cream in general, so this was right up my alley. They cut the ice cream sandwich in half, so it was perfect for my mom & I to share. The zing from the gingerbread complemented the creaminess of the gelato. It was a perfect ending to a great meal.Having said all that and adding everything up, this meal cost a pretty penny. Luckily, I had a gift certificate that covered it all, but it was all worth it. The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. Despite The Clam being rather far from where I live, I would definitely return for a special occasion or a fancy date night and would highly recommend it to anyone.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

My wife was looking to get us into their sister restaurant Little Owl, and we found The Clam. Super friendly staff from the hostess to the waiter. There were So many good choices on the menu we came up with the bright idea of three courses! We chose lobster and fried clam sliders and Clam chowder. The clam chowder had a wonderfully light broth chock full of fresh herbs onion and potatoes. The sliders were to die for. Could not have asked for two better appetizers. The pasta is handmade at the restaurant and was served with spicy tomato sauce. The pasta was perfectly Al Dente and they even split the shared dish for us in the kitchen. When our main courses arrived we were basically full. I got the white clam pizza, and it was just ok which was fine with me cause I was not hungry anymore, lol. The pizza was grilled and the crust was super thin, and just not so memorable. Too much oregano and overall too much on top of the pizza. I feel like less is more with these little artisanal pizzas. We were also spoiled by having one of the best pizzas I've ever had earlier in the day at Brooklyn's Smorgasburg. My wife had the skate with green beans and browned butter sauce. Her entree was delicious but slightly too much salt. This was the kind of place you could enjoy a long slow dinner without being rushed. Highly recommend.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

In fact, had I known it was in the same 'hood, I probably would have gone because y'see, the Clam was a spontaneous decision for me as a late night dining experience. I had just gotten out of the Carole King musical, ""Beautiful"", and thought I could head to the West Village and try the famous Japanese-style Korean BBQ spot, Takashi. Much to my dismay, they shoo'ed me away since they were in their exclusive ramen-serving hour. So I just walked up a block and found the Clam. It struck me as fancier than I had in mind.However, as I was about to turn around, the young manager sat me at a table without hesitation. With the white tablecloths and dark, candle-lit ambiance, believe me, I was the one who was hesitating (photo: bit.ly/1oZtgoe). When I saw the menu, no small feat with the lack of lighting, I was surprised it was a rather concise collection of dishes presented by chef Mike Price. Mostly shellfish-focused, of course, except for a steak and a chicken option to accommodate presumably Aunt Rose who's allergic to seafood and the check. Nothing struck me as overly fancy except the prices. They even serve spaghetti and clams and a clam fried rice. I supposed I could have gone in that direction, but I felt a need to try something different.I got it with the $14 Scallops Crudo. It was a quartet topped with strawberries, hazelnuts, chives and lime juice (photo: bit.ly/1uFJoyw). They were quite fresh-tasting and gone rather quickly. No matter as I kept my stomach company with one of their piping-hot, ""complementary"" Parker House Rolls - buttery, yeasty with a sprinkle of sea salt on top (photo: bit.ly/1t84ly6)- and a flute of the Prosecco Cuvée Beatrice (photo: bit.ly/1mUKNZY), a nice sparkler though frankly it was starting to put me to sleep. For my entree, I was almost tempted by the Fried Belly Clam & Lobster Sandwich, but it just seemed a bit too stiff in there to gorge on something like that near midnight.Besides I was watching a romantic couple at the next table serving oysters to each other in an obvious act of seafood foreplay, so I assume looking at the fried crumbs on my face would dissipate the moment for them. Instead, I ordered the $31 Black Sea Bass, which must have attended the finest schools in the ocean to achieve that price tag. It came on top of a creamy pistachio pesto sauce with carrots and grilled gem lettuce (photo: bit.ly/1pSPlUw). It was flaky-tender with the crispy skin left intact, good but not entirely memorable. I must admit to myself I am one of those red-checkerboard-plastic-tablecloth-and-nutcracker kind of a seafood diner because this track was running a little fast for this culinary plow horse.FOOD - 3.5 stars...nice seafood for sure albeit at a higher price point than I think it may warrantAMBIANCE - 3 stars...awfully dark at night, perhaps flashlights could be an optionSERVICE - 4 stars...fine waiter, no complaints hereTOTAL - 3 stars...the idea of an upmarket clam house just seems contradictory to me",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

98,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"With a long-held following for their two established restaurants (The Little Owl and Market Table), Chef Mike Price and Joey Campanaro opened up The Clam in a well-traversed corner in West Village. As the name suggests, much of the menu is devoted to this bivalve, although it's not exclusively a shellfish or seafood restaurant. Even early on, making reservations required at least three weeks advance notice, although I was able to get our group of five a table at a prime dinner hour one Wednesday evening.Located a few steps from a relatively new addition from the prior year (Piora), The Clam boasts one of the more eclectic interiors in the area. Capable of holding 40-50 guests at a time, the restaurant features an even distribution of rustic brick walls against lengthy (almost floor-to-ceiling) windows, smooth, dark flooring, and a ceiling dotted with a mosaic of mother-of-pearl tiles. The design is intended to mimic the experience of being enclosed within a clam shell, a goal that's perhaps only partially successful. Nonetheless, we were efficiently seated after confirming our reservation, and our server was able to clarify a few questions and note a few adjustments to the dishes we ordered.Our group started off with an order of the Clam Dip. The dip is uniquely composed, made of sour cream, Worcestershire, and cayenne pepper, as well as a few surprising, chewy bites of top neck clams. Served with zesty potato chips, which are generously seasoned with Old Bay, it was a promising start to the meal. Thankfully, the small portion (especially when shared amongst five people) left enough room for the Spaghetti & Clams, which my friend and I split as an appetizer. The dish, comprised of spaghetti in red sauce, is complemented with a few clams, a small salad, and a spicy gravy. The spaghetti has a noticeable texture and chew, the red sauce lightly acidic and aromatic, and the spice from the gravy a subtle contrast in flavor. While it treads on the pricier side for a spaghetti ($21), it's one of the signature dishes for good reason.My friends opted for more seafood-based mains, but I went with the Roasted Half Bell & Evans Chicken. While it might be seen as a pedestrian dish, I was pleased with how tempting it was; the chicken had a crisp and well-seasoned skin, but was able to maintain a piping hot and tender interior. With a side of hot lettuce, hen of the woods mushrooms, and sliced radish, it made for a filling main and a solid option for those who are looking for non-seafood options at the restaurant.In hindsight, The Clam is one of the more successful openings for this year. A compact and well-executed menu, professional service, and a cozy dining ambiance almost guarantees a satisfactory meal. The restaurant has recently expanded its hours to encompass lunch and brunch as well, which gives diners an even better chance of securing a table in the upcoming months.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

We had the clam dip, then raw clams as an appetizer. For entree, my husband had 5 baked clams, and my daughter and I each had a squash and apple salad. All very good. However, we didn't finish until 10:30. It shouldn't take 3 hours to have dinner. Much too slow.   Also, there were 4 drunk people at a table. They had been there for a while because they had finished their dinners.  They were loud and rude. When we left at 10:30, they were still there, drinking and getting more drunk and sound. We spoke to the hostess and the manager. Both of them did nothing. I thought they could have asked them to be a little quieter, to be sensitive the other diners. However, they continued to serve them drinks. We will never go back.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

Tony set aside a great table right near the window so we can people watch and there's nothing like that in New York City. We had the clam dip appetizer.  Clam chowder. And an order of Burrata. For a main dish we had to Maine lobster and leek raviolo. Not ravioli, lol. Tasty. Also shared the mushroom leak and fontina cheese omelette with tossed greens on the side.

103,fm6hiXKp2IYWWitQHvwaZA,good food lover P.,5.0 star rating,"We were visiting NYC over Memorial Day week and LOVED our meals at the The Clam. First, let me say - I am more than a little picky and I research plans to death when we travel! Plus, I am an accomplished home cook and love well prepared meals.  I selected the clam for the first dinner in NYC (thank you fellow yelpers!) and it did not disappoint. The ambiance, the service, the food - everything was on point. As starters we ordered the clam dip and chips, the fried soft shell crab (it is seasonal and not on the online menu) and the lobster sliders. My husband LOVED the crab and I thought the lobster sliders were really good. A little dry, but overall, but I still loved them. I am from the Deep South and I thought a little extra mayo on the bread might have solved the problem. :-) but, maybe, that's just me! Even though I read lots of reviews where people loved the clam dip and chips, it just wasn't our cup of tea. The dip tasted a little like vinegar and after 2-3 bites, I could not get beyond the flavor. We finished off the chips, but did not eat all the dip. But, the atmosphere ( although a little loud depending on the crowd - we stayed a long time) was fabulous and the service was great - attentive but not intrusive, it was some of the best we've had anywhere. Too, I had a cucumber and gin cocktail, it was really tasty. Cool and refreshing, loved it. For entrees, we both had clams and spaghetti based on yelp reviews - OMG!!!! It was a great dish, pasta was well done but with a bite, the clams and the sauce a little spicy, the crunch and texture of fresh arugula - if you like seafood or pasta - please order this dish. We both loved it. I could have done with just the spaghetti and clams and the free Parker house rolls - it was that wonderful. Of all the restaurants I've ever been to, this one dish was extra special in my opinion! The clam was so wonderful, we both agreed to cancel our reservations at another place and opted to return to this restaurant. We loved it that much. The second go round, we did not have the same beautiful female wait person, but the male server we had was equally good.Dinner two, my husband ordered the scallop crudo (another dish highly rated on yelp) and I ordered the chilled lobster louie style. The scallops were wonderful, cool and flavorful. The lobster was a little pricey for the amount, but I really liked the rumoulade sauce. Another round of fabulous crispy on the outside and light/fluffy on the inside Parker house rolls and butter - yum. For entrees, I ordered the steak that came with sides of potato casserole and broccoli. It was wonderful. The meat was cooked just as it was ordered and the sauce it was topped with was a savory delight. The broccoli was done well, but still crunchy and the potato casserole was equally tasty. My husband ordered the lobster louie for and entree along with escarole and carrots. As he ate mouthfuls of both veggies, I heard only - this is really good over and over from his side of the table. So, the veggies were a big hit!Cocktails: I started with the cucumber gin drink and moved on to the aviation. They were both well crafted. Smarter the second time around, we actually saved a little room for dessert. We shared the 86 proof chocolate icebox cake. It was cool, just the right size and had a hint of bourbon flavor without overpowering the dish. My husband topped it off with a brandy that he proclaimed to be a perfect end to a perfect meal. Highly recommend!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood
104,-FL3-KW6RNl7qyJnksnpLg,Paul A.,4.0 star rating,"Maintaing the balance of an amiable and enjoyable atmosphere with intelligent and painstakingly crafted food, The Clam is well worth a stop by anyone hoping to sample to city's best seafood. Let me first say that if you are a particular lover of bivalves this will be a cold 5 star spot for you. For instance, anyone who digs Flex Mussels will probably faint when they step into this place. Clams, clams, and more clams. Heck, we even got a fish dish just to try.Let me first say that the Parker House roll here is nothing compared to the one they give you at Butter in midtown. Butter doesn't do too much else well so just give them that at least. It is their only really good item. Dry Parker House rolls aside, this place definitely stunned. The clam chowder was one of the better versions of this dish in the entire city, as it is both restrained while being satisfyingly creamy. The Cherrystone Stuffies were awesome, much like Oyster Rockefeller but with cherrystone clams instead, chopped up and mixed with a hearty almost vegetal pepper and breadcrumb stuffing. The Spaghetti and Clams is also a very good, if not somewhat overly oily dish. Speaking of overly oily I have to say that my bass entree, while breathtakingly beautiful (peep the pic!), could have had a little more flavor and a little less butter. Honestly, even while I said ""the bass"" to the waiter I knew I should have been ordering the Clam Fried Rice. Well, I will definitely be back and I won't make the same mistake twice.So, in summary, this restaurant rocks. It is new and will iron out some of their ever-changing fish preparations, but when it comes to the House Specialties section of the menu at least, they really have it on lock.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

You could taste it in every bite.Appetizers were: baked clams, iced clams, West coast & east coast oysters and the chips and clam dip. Not a bad bite to be had. Each were phenomenal and brought out with perfect timing. Also the Parker house bread was a beautiful pre entree treat. Loved it.Entree: gf had the bass and I had the Pat LaFreida burger (I know, but it was extremely tasty!). The bass was grilled to perfection and gorgeously presented. Dessert: coffee and 86 proof bourbon chocolate ice cake. One word... WOW. 2 of my favorite things in a single, beautiful dessert. Simply heaven.Great service, I HIGHLY recommend!

108,Imxj-jtadA3Rfx-66ucFhg,Rick R.,5.0 star rating,"Wife and I were in NY for a week's vacation and a friend of ours who lives in Manhattan, (the Upper West side, btw), recommended this downtown spot. We got the table in the back, near the window, which turned out to be perfect since it was quiet and it wasn't until we left and walked through the rest of the restaurant that we realized it was a fairly loud place. Decor was okay....simple for a nice evening out and not over the top nor plastic chairs and counters.Now the food caught us off-guard for such a low-key spot. Here are some of the must-haves: start with the Parker House Rolls. Where they get the name from, I'm sure they would have told us if we had asked, but we really didn't care because, hey, they're rolls! But boy are they good. Baked on the premises they come out warm ('natch), with a slight crispy top and moist inside. Accompanied by soft butter (and that's the mark of a good restaurant for me) that made the whole taste experience great. At $1.50 each they were worth it....clearly, because who truly writes this much about a dinner roll?Next, we had the scallops, which in our collective tastes, were probably the best or closest to the best we've ever had! The only issue we had was that there were just 4 of them and they weren't huge. But as for taste, ya gotta luv 'em! ($18)Moving along with the server's recommendation we tried the fried clams and lobster sliders. Also a good choice since it's been years since I've had fried clams and these were done just to my liking. Big portions and two for $28. This and one other dish would certainly be enough dinner for 2 people. In fact, if you just did the biscuits and this dish, that would certainly satisfy.The next dish was skate, belonging to the sting-ray family ( and yes, I had to look it up.) It was just okay. Mild with no exceptional taste. Charred corn off the cobb was excellent as a side dish. For dessert, Gelato with chocolate chip, was absolutely FANTASTIC!Go and enjoy your meal!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

Her service was impeccable.      I am a sucker for oysters, and the Clam has both east and west coast mollusks to choose from.Brinley even thought my joke about east coast oysters rolling up on west coast oysters was slightly amusing. Bonus points awarded!    The menu is so amazing,we opted for a bunch of appetizers instead of the usual app,entree route,and I am happy we went that route.Yuzu marinated fluke crudo was out of this world.Super fresh,and the flavors were spot on.Fried clam and lobster sliders.Another hit.I actually ate my slider in six bites!Go ahead and laugh,but I wanted to enjoy each tiny bite to prolong the pleasure.Clam Chowder was the best I ever had.Not too creamy,yet delicious.Oysters.We enjoyed 6 east coast and 6 west coast,and enjoyed both.I had never eaten West coast oysters before,and enjoyed their flavor profile very much.The drink menu is very interesting,and we had a few of their signature cocktails.The drinks were refreshing and potent!For dessert we had the 86 proof chocalate icebox cake which might be the best dessert I have ever eaten.If you like chocolate,or even think you like chocalate,try this dessert.Brinley explained it was some kind of cookie soaked in liquor,but all I remember is bliss.I really really liked the Clam and will be returning soon.Apologies to my west coast oyster friends!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

So, naturally, we got a round of West Coast. West Coast was not the best coast this time around, so we finished off our oyster binge with another round of the East. The clams were great, too. Excellently prepared.The clam dip was delicious, served alongside crispy, seasoned potato chips for dipping. Even the fries were delicious, just the right amount of crispy, and went well with the tangy cocktail sauce. And of course, we didn't forget our vegetables.

119,4-eIb1rA1R6l7wocUt75Xg,Jack K.,5.0 star rating,"Clam, in general, has always been regarded for its tough and chewy textures especially when it's overcooked, and most definitely overlooked when it's presented next to a more popular choice like oyster or mussel. That's not the case here because all spotlights and drooling taste buds are on The Clam. As with any dining experience, it's essential to have a starter to warm up the foodies' palates. Even more so, the starter has to be good since it usually sets the tone and pace for everything else that follows. Chef & owner, Mike Price, executed on this concept flawlessly. We were served with the freshest and softest rolls (all freshly made in-house). These rolls were so flavorful with just a light spread of soft creamy butter and a touch of sea salt. (I could easily eat a dozen or more!)Once our taste buds started to drool, we couldn't wait to try the rest. Most dishes on the menu consist of clam as either the main or supporting ingredient. My favorites -- the Fried Belly Clam & Lobster Sliders. For two sliders, it will run you $24, a bit pricey, but worth it. I really enjoyed the crispiness of fried belly and the tenderness of fresh lobster combined-- an interesting combination of textures and flavors. Then on with the Clam Chowder, which is the real deal-- light and creamy with fresh clams. Another delicious one is the Grilled White Clam Pizza --comes with thin crust, great for sharing.What started as a curiosity to try something I've always considered boring and bland, actually turned out to be quite fascinating and delicious.

Saying that, my big problem is with their service. Our waiter hardly exchange any word with us, he just showed up with his pen and pad ready to take the order, no suggestions or telling us about the specials of the day. When we said we're not ready yet, he disappeared and it took him a while to come back. We (my wife and I ) felt kind of patronized by his behavior, it felt like he doesn't want to be bothered. The dishes didn't come in the order we expected. We had the ravioli first and 20 minutes later the clam dip. We also noticed when we got the bill that we've been charged for the bread and butter. We really like the place (we live in the neighborhood). But I don't think service does stand up with their level of food and pricing.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

The hostess and waitress were friendly and accommodating when our party ran late and increased in size. The wine selection was great. The meal unfortunately was uneven. Daily oysters were perfectly shucked and delicious. Brussels sprouts are a must. The dishes with this namesake's ingredient however were disappointing. The baked clams were chewy and overly breaded. In South Philly you can get a dozen baked clams for a third of the price and they'll knock your socks off. The clam pizza also disappointed. It hardly tasted of clams and what few there were were also chewy. I'd go back for a drink for sure but probably skip the dinner.,The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

The sliders are good as well, though the lobster is better than the fried clams (might be better to try to get it with just the lobster if possible). The free butter rolls are sinful. I also love the ice cream sandwich dessert; I haven't tried the others but they all look good.The service: Accommodating, prompt, and friendly.The ambiance: Cozy and small, with nice background music.

Went to The Clam last night for dinner and had a delicious time.If you appreciate seafood and don't mind paying for the good stuff, this is your place. But if you don't really, truly LOVE seafood, as was the case for a few in my party, The Clam may not be so suitable.We arrived for a 5:15 reservation and were seated immediately. It took a little while for bread and drinks to come out, hence the 0.5 star deduction. Though the rolls were warm and delicious when they did arrive!Our seafood dishes were insanely good. We ordered the stuffed clams, clam dip, seafood raviolo, linguine in red clam sauce, duck breast salad, and crispy chicken.The clam dip was the best I've ever had. Even if you don't think you like clam dip, order it! The lobster raviolo was also incredible, though keep in mind this dish is a singular (albeit large) raviolo. So if you want to make that your entree, order a few sides as well.The linguine in clam sauce was fresh and delicious -- You could tell the pasta was homemade. And the baked clams were perfectly breaded and tender.I can't vouch for the chicken or duck salad, which my non-seafood-fanatic friends ordered, but I heard it was good. The duck salad was a very tiny portion though, so be warned. (Tiny portions are a theme. If you're the kind of person who likes massive plates to bring home for later, this is not your place.)Overall, The Clam is a delicious, fancy treat and a must for all shellfish lovers.

Service was good and I'd give it 4 stars.  My boyfriend and I arrived early and grabbed a drink at the bar. Mid-drink, the hostess asked if we would be okay being seated at our table as there was a couple wanting to dine at the bar, sans reservation. We said fine and got seated nicely as a spacious 4-top in the back with the couch on one side and our remaining party of 2 joined.We ordered everything at once (we had a tight schedule as I knew in advance that the restaurant had an 8:15pm reservation after). This included a bottle of wine, 2 starters, 4 entrees, 2 vegetables and the house Parker rolls. I'd rate the food anywhere from 2.5 - 4 stars depending on what you order.Starters included 4 east coast (Wellfleet from MA) and 4 west coast (Royal Miyagi from BC) oysters as well as the popular clam dip.  The oysters were great. I've had both types at other oyster bars and  probably slightly favored the Royal Miyagi. The clam dip (2.5-3 stars) was served with the house chips, which were a bit too salty for me.  The dip itself was fine but not something I would order or rave about. It has a bit of a pickle taste in there and just seemed more creamy than clam-like to me. Let's just say there was still dip left after 4 of us took a bit, and I was not having seconds.Then came the house Parker Rolls which were nice and fluffy. I didn't even need to butter than and they were still very tasty.  For entrees, I ordered the whole fish which was a sea bream,  and this was probably my favorite of the entrees (4 stars) and our whole meal along with the oysters. My date ordered the monkfish over a butternut squash risotto (3 stars) and the other couple ordered the clam pizza (2 stars) and spaghetti with clams (3 stars). The vegetables to go on the side were the Brussels sprouts (2 stars) and the Cauliflower (3 stars).  The restaurant is nice for a date and I'd give the ambiance a 4, but lacked for me on food and value. The monkfish and sea bream were in the $30s range, oysters were $3.50 each, clam dip was $13 and the pasta/pizzas were around the $20s. I'd overall give the food 2.75 - 3 stars.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't rush us when making our decisions.  We decided to start with the Campechana Coctel de Camaron.  This appetizer is a good choice for groups.  The dip consisted of hearty chunks of clam, marinara sauce, lime, and avocados - delicious! I highly recommend it!For our entrees, we ordered the Spaghetti & Clams, Clam Fried Rice, and the Block Island Swordfish with a side of Asparagus. The Spaghetti & Clams was delicious and the presentation was nice - 5 clams around a heaping pile of spaghetti in clam spicy gravy with a leafy bunch of arugula atop the pasta.  The spicy gravy was not as spicy, but more salty than I had expected.  I appreciated how Chef Price was not stingy at all about the clam in the pasta.  I'd even go out on a limb to say it was 60% pasta, 40% clam in spicy gravy.The Clam Fried Rice was my favorite and also less salty than my Spaghetti & Clams dish.  There was a medley of pork belly confit, snow peas, and pickled onion that really brought a lot of flavor to the dish without being overwhelmingly salty.Chef Mike Price must be a fan of the miniature croutons as they appeared in the swordfish dish as well as the side of asparagus.  The Black Island Swordfish had great presentation, but the dish itself wasn't too amazing in my opinion.  Then again, I'm not a huge fan of fish entrees in general.  The Grilled Asparagus was pretty delicious. The presentation was nice and the croutons really worked in this dish to add texture.

I had high expectations when I visited this restaurant as I heard the restaurant opened in partnership with Joey Campanaro from The Little Owl (one of my favorite restaurants in the city). I had some hits and misses while dining here, but overall the seafood selection was pretty fresh and some dishes were very well prepared to make a pleasant dinner.I started the meal with clam dip and potato chips, and fell in love with the light and delightful snack. Scallop crudo with pear, hazelnuts and lime was also outstanding, with smooth texture of scallop that was not overwhelmed by overdressing. On the other hand, clam chowder soup with oyster crackers could been better with less salt. I liked the baked clams dish called cherry stone stuffies, with great flavor. Steamed little necks had nice texture, but the broth could've been slightly less salty. Spaghetti and clams was definitely the highlight of the meal. I really loved the simplicity of the dish that yet had very nice texture of the noodle working harmoniously with the clams. By the time fried clam belly sandwich arrived, I was already pretty stuffed, but decided to try a bite anyways. I liked the crunchy texture of clam belly in fried form, but the overall dish was a bit too buttery for my taste. I finished the meal with a dessert of apply and cranberry crisp with almond crumble and ginger gelato, but it was largely forgettable.The restaurant definitely has a very nice neighborhood restaurant vibe quite fitting for its location in West Village, making it ideal for a casual date night or a gathering with friends before a night out around the neighborhood. Getting a reservation was a bit difficult, so be prepared to book a table in advance or show up early and see if there is any walk-in table available. The restaurant has a full bar, but I thought the cocktail selection was a bit on the underwhelming side. Go with the white wine instead.

It was about 1/4 size of a pinky nail.We just started the dish and that really put a damper to say the least on my birthday meal.  The oysters were fantastic. The ravioli was delicious.  The signature spaghetti dish and the sides were spot on. The staff and service were impeccable... Which is why it is hard to leave the 1 star. But a piece of glass???

But I think this place is a tad better because of the vibe, the seating and the reasonable price point. I came in around 7pm with a friend, who is also hard core pescetararian like me. We were both charmed by the rustic and cozy decor at the Clam. Note: perfect date spot.The waitress who took our orders were super nice and attentive. The services through out the night was on point and friendly, not like many other new-open restaurants where services were always lacking in the first few weeks. Onto the food. About 50% of the menu contains clam, another 30% are non-clam seafood and other 20% are meat, the rest of them are veggie/sides. We ordered:fresh little neck clams and king crab: came with creamy spicy mustard and fried shallots. Fresh, briny, exactly what it should be.Scallop crudo: sweet scallop paired with red blush pear, hazelnuts, chives, lime. bite size sea candy. Chef specialty: spaghetti & clams with spicy gravy. Love the slightly spicy kick but I think the spaghetti a little drier than what I prefer.Side: chili roasted brussel sprouts with bacon bits and peanut. Frankly, my fave of the night. It is a veggie dish but tastes like pork belly! Savory bacon, sweet and bitterness from the brussel sprouts paired perfectly. We were way too full for dessert :/ save it for next time.

I was so excited we were able to get a reservation & finally check it out. I absolutely love seafood & with a name like The Clam, I thought I would be in for a big treat. Unfortunately it was a bit underwhelming. I would give the experience 3.5 stars.The restaurant itself has a very warm ambiance, & the service throughout was extremely friendly & attentive. The hostess was a sweetheart & greeted us very warmly. As far as seafood goes, frankly, I've had better. My friend & I split everything. The steamers were very good, but the spaghetti & clams was a miss. The dish was WAY too salty & the pasta was undercooked versus being perfectly al dente. The standout dish was the fried clam belly & lobster sliders. I wish they served the clam bellies solo without all of the additional stuff. I expected a niche menu. What I didn't expect was for the menu to feel so uninspired, which sadly, it did. They didn't have enough simple options either, which sometimes is the key with seafood. We also paid way too much money for what we got. It was a nice experience, not bad by any means, but it was lacking a certain ""je ne sais quoi"". Excellent seafood in WV is lacking... particularly places where reservations are a requirement. They are on to something. I hope they figure it out!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

Other items I like are the Clam fried rice, roasted chicken, and swordfish.  They also get extra points for splitting up items when you are sharing dishes.If you can't get a reservation for dinner, they do a great brunch as well with a lot of their classic dishes on the menu.  But for me, the peekytoe crab benedict is a personal brunch favorite.I think their desserts are average (not sure if they have a pastry chef), but I am usually so stuffed by the end of my meal that I just skip it.  If you're looking for a new restaurant to try in the West Village, definitely give this place a look!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

So it makes sense that we would eventually end up at a restaurant that is namesake to our little shellfish friends. Our table shared the clam dip, which was surprisingly tasty and full of clam bits. Oysters of both the east coast and west coast variety were enjoyed. My stuffies, which were their version of a baked clam, was not what I expected, and sadly not my favorite part of the meal. One of my friends ordered the Maine lobster with clam stuffing, and said it was excellent. Our other friends both ordered the spaghetti with clams, which was also impressive.

I'm more the type who likes a ribeye from Wolfgang's or more traditional French food. I don't much like spices or sweetness. I like herbs. Not weed. Not men named ""Herb."" I mean savory garden herbs. I like rosemary and thyme. I'm in my 40's and have the tastebuds of a 65 year old European man in a sport coat. To me, the food was not good. It was nicely prepared. It just wasn't good. The dish was so sweet I couldn't distinguish the brussell sprouts from the short ribs. It was one uniform flavor. I dined solo at the bar on a Wednesday evening. When I came in, only about half the place was full, and it was mostly women dining together. To me, based on my taste, this is always a bad sign. Women seem to like sweet food. I don't like Marc Forgione or Bubby's, but women LOVE those two places. Everything there tastes like brunch to me, and one can't distinguish between the components on the plate: The meat tastes sweet. The vegetables taste sweet. It's food for people who want every meal to be brunch or cupcakes. Trout cupcakes. Duck cupcakes. Short rib cupcakes. Where's the savoriness people? Where's the parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme people? I'll probably stick to restaurants patronized by wealthy men in their 60's.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

I ordered a fish entree in an attempt to be healthier, but was so jealous of those who ordered the sandwich and spaghetti! I want to take the bf here - I think it is defintiely a standout restaurant in NYC. The only downer was they messed up the billing - they charged 2 portions on one card.

224,J91Z-EF0G8n8rSj4EJKqqw,Asuka N.,5.0 star rating,"We've been looking for some new seafood places that have an emphasis on shellfish, so we were excited to come and try The Clam, which seems to be relatively new (judging by the number of reviews) and not something I've seen in the past when I've been in the neighborhood. Even though we were nearly 15 minutes late due to the subway having one of those 'we're not moving for a long time because the train dispatch says so' moments, the host was kind enough to hold our seat for us - but I think we were pushing our luck. The space itself has a casual yet classy feel to it, and I felt a wee bit underdressed showing up in jeans and a t-shirt (even though Yelp advises casual clothing is fine - smarter than true casual is probably the best way to describe the appropriate level of attire). Service was also good, with food coming out in a well-spaced manner.The main drawback was really that I wasn't a fan of the beer list - there were a few crafts, but nothing really of highlight. The food, though, was downright delicious, even if we did go a little overboard and order more than we should have. Before hitting the menu items, the buttered-up brioche rolls we were served were absolutely great - one of the best dinner rolls I've had - puffy and full of buttery goodness, it's everything a dinner roll should be. After that, we started out with two appetizers - the clam dip and the lamb. I was pleasantly surprised by both; the dip wasn't as overly creamy as I'd feared, and they really do put in a lot of clams - so you get their full flavor, paired against what are really good house-made potato chips. The lamb may have been better, though; while the tartare was good in its own right, the seared lamb - done at most medium-rare, with a delicately charred skin - was perfectly prepared to bring out the natural flavors of the lamb. The other dishes (closer to the size of entrees) were the steamed littlenecks and the clam belly/lobster sandwich. The former was relatively standard, but I liked it more than your average clams in white wine / garlic broth - it seemed to have a bit more of a deep, nuanced flavor than being steamed in something simple. The sandwich was a revelation, being seriously delicious despite my skepticism of what fried clams and lobster would taste like. The lobster is lightly tossed in mayo sauce, while the fried clams provide the depth, texture, and additional burst of greasy goodness. It's a bit pricey ($29 was the market price), but it's something so unique quite unique but really well-executed that it should be tried at least once.Although we were quite full by this point, we rounded out the meal with two desserts - the gingerbread ice cream sandwich and the panna cotta. I really liked the panna cotta, as I'm very partial to the way they present it - a small island of panna cotta surrounded by a moat of rich rhubarb and strawberry 'soup'. I'm not a huge fan of standalone panna cotta, so going a bit over the top on the fruit sauce was a plus in my book. The gingerbread ice cream sandwich was really good as well. I'm not sure if I'd regularly have it, as the mascarpone ice cream definitely feels a touch lighter than your regular ice cream - and I like my ice creams heavy - but it paired really well with the gingerbread, especially once you got the rich bites of brown butter caramel as well.The Clam is definitely a popular place, and rightfully so - they do a fantastic job presenting clams (and other seafood) in all sorts of delectable, unique ways. I may even try some of the land dishes more next time, considering how well-done the spring lamb was prepared. A nice little spot on the southwestern edge of West Village that I hope to visit again sometime soon!",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

229,qtyjMryBCI_zYILQRsKrgg,J. L.,4.0 star rating,"I liked this place a lot. It's probably more on the side of 4.5 stars as it has this great neighborhood restaurant charm. I chose this place because I wanted a place reminiscent of an upscale Hog Island in SF which my family loves. We were also able to dinner outside which was nice for a warm evening. I booked this on Opentable a few weeks ahead of time without issue, however, I noticed by the day of my reservation all the time slots were filled. The drinks are very well made here the Scotch Bonnet and Cucumber Gin Cooler were my favorites, however the Pineapple Run Fizzle was far too sweet for my tastes. We started with the fresh bread which was amazing and buttery, but save some or ask for more if you get the Clam Chowder. Our appetizers were the Fluke Crudo and Fried Soft Shell Crabs, both were really good, but the crab was the best out of the two. For dinner we had the Grilled Seabring, Stuffed Clams, Clam Chowder and Spaghetti & Clams. The Stuffed Clams and Clam Chowder are a must, the Chowder was my favorite, as it had lots of clams and chinks of bacon. At one point my entire table asked for more bread and began taking turns soaking piece of bread in clams and bacon. It was really that good. My least favorite dish was the Spaghetti & Clams which was surprising because it's so popular amongst Yelp reviewers. I think it's popular because spaghetti is something everyone can relate to, but I found the pasta a bit too firm and sauce uninspired. However, the bar is set pretty high if you live in NYC which has an abundance of great Italian restaurants which you can juxtapose dishes against.Lastly we had  the Cinnamon & Pecan Bun Sundae, Baileys Gelato, and Ginger Bread IC Sandwich. Honestly, they were ok but you should skip dessert here and go somewhere else. It was the reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars but again being a native NYer the bar is set high.

The atmosphere was very relaxed, casual chic but I was still treated nicely in my t-shirt and shorts.The wine on tap was pretty decent. Not the best I've had but still a pretty well balanced white, and hey, it's on tap.My wife opted for the Cucumber Gin Cooler. This is often a tricky drink to order because it's either too sweet or to boozy but the Clam managed to get it just perfect resulting in a refreshing drink.For food, my wife had the clam fried rice, a nice dish, not too heavy with enough going on to satisfy if you're a rice fan. For me, it would have been better as a side but she really enjoyed it and her being a rice lover who am I to judge.I had the Chipotle Braised Chicken Tostada and was very happily surprised. It had a really nice range of flavors giving it enough depth but no flavor in itself was too overpowering. The tostada was still nice and crunchy when it came out giving it a nice texture along with the avocado and pulled chicken. The dish was also not as spicy as one would think given the name, so for those that are weary of anything hinting to spicy, this is still a safe bet.The service was decent. Our waiter was very personal, attentive and took his time with us. One would expect this given that the restaurant was not super busy at the time but you'd be surprised sometimes. The pricing was also very decent, $10 for the tap-wine, $14 for a cocktail and the brunch dishes average around $15. In New York, one would easily pay more for less, so you don't feel cheated when you come here.The only minor point was that the restrooms were quite dark, so if your eye sight is poor this may be a bit annoying. Maybe up the lights a little there guys, doesn't have to be much.All and all, I was very impressed with the Clam and would definitely come back to try out the dinner menu some time, and we'll definitely make it back for brunch.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

For sides, the chili roasted brussels sprouts were too soft for my taste, but the carrots had a nice sweetness and paired very well with flavorful pumpkin seeds.For dessert, we had a ginger ice cream and a grapefruit hyssop sorbet.  The ginger ice cream was excellent and refreshing.  While the flavor of the grapefruit hyssop sorbet was very good, its texture was too icy.Service is superb; due to subway delays, we were quite late for our reservation, but we were still warmly welcomed and seated promptly.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

This quaint little restaurant is nestled away in a quiet little neighborhood in the West Village. It's small, but the perfect size to make your dinner or lunch feel intimate. I highly recommend for a date but would not recommend for large parties unless you planned on renting out the entire restaurant. They have a great wine list and the food looks so simple and clean but tastes phenomenal! I always start with Littleneck Clams on the 1/2 shell and the Diver Scallop Crudo. I will never not order the Scallop Crudo! It's very light and satisfying and all the ingredients blend well together. I've also tried the Main Lobster and Leek Ravioli. The flavors within it are great, however my only complaint was that it was one big ravioli as opposed to multiple smaller pieces that made up the dish. However, with that said, it was tasty enough where I definitely wanted more. The Cherrystone stuffies were just ok for me. I'm a big fan of baked clams and definitely had better elsewhere so I would pass on that and stick with the raw clams if you'd like to start with a clam dish. Lastly, the Sautéed Winter Flounder is to die for! The first time I came here, they prepared Chilean Sea Bass the same way but I think the fish varies depending on the season. The carrot puree and roasted vegetables are so savory. Each time, the fish was cooked perfectly and ever time I leave that restaurant I think about this particular dish for about a week afterwards.

They quite literally made a cameo appearance in one of my dreams this week.Let me begin by saying we are 'foodies' in a non-obnoxious way. We love to eat, and we know the difference between a good meal and an excessively trendy or hyped up restaurant (looking at you, Spice Market, RedFarm, Villard Michel Richard, Narcissa, Pearl, etc)True to form we started with half a dozen oysters, the scallop crudo, and the lobster raviolo.  The oysters were of mixed regions, none being bad but my bf was only really impressed by 50%, Very fresh. Crudo was excellent. On par with Eataly's. I wasn't terribly fond of the raviolo mainly because it was an excessive of spice and I was expecting more of the lobster meat to come through, but still fine.Boyfriend ordered the special fish because it was diet-friendly and he wasn't terribly excited about it but that's his own fault. Probably didn't make it any better to watch me inhale both of our delicious, buttery parker rolls. The lobster sliders. I would accept stretch marks for these bad boys. (Or, you know, continue spending 10 hours a week working out to keep myself a size 0). Really though we will be back and I will be dragging every visiting family member here to join me in ecstatic oral eating ecstasy. Early on in the meal there was a bottle of wine involved that magically turned into a second bottle around slider time. And then after dinner drinks magically appeared alongside the two desserts we ordered. For some inexplicable reason I don't remember what they were but only that they were excellent.

Every bite was amazing- 5 stars for food, but negative stars for service. I had been wanting to try this place for a while and my boyfriend took me for my birthday. It was a lovely experience until a celebrity came in and was seated next to us and the wait staff completely forgot that our table existed. It was near the end of our meal, and we were thinking about dessert, but it took about 40 minutes to get anyone's attention... so obviously we got the check instead of dessert... even though about every person that worked at the restaurant including our server was right next to us serving the celebrity. I'll most likely never go back here because there isn't really an excuse to forget about your table, there's only about 15 tables in the whole restaurant, and it was not a full house that night, and they were not the only person on staff.

It was seasoned well with the cheese shaved razor thin to make it taste better. We had the clam lobster sandwich and the whole flounder with bone. I couldnt comment too much on the clam lobster as it wasnt my choice but the fish was very fresh, not over cooked, moist and yet not too soft....Casual yet semi-trendy and definitely a date night spot..maybe the 3rd or 4th date kind of place.

270,axz70giIENWIacRXr-811A,Cecilia Z.,4.0 star rating,"The Clam isn't exactly your traditional New England seafood shack, but that's not a bad thing. Mike Price and Joey Campanaro can do no wrong, again expanding their footprints throughout the WV, only with a focus on seafood this time. The ambiance and energy here is quite similar to that of Market Table and Little Owl, though the space is much less cramped than the Little Owl. I'm a big fan of the high ceilings and large windows overlooking Hudson Street, giving the space a comfortable yet slightly romantic feel. We were also very lucky to be seated at a corner two-top right by the window on the Friday evening we visited. Perfect for date night, I have to say.Because the bf and I had kicked the night off a little earlier over drinks and snacks at nearby Fedora, we ended up sampling just a few things and shared everything. First off, the Campechana Coctel de Camaron with avocado and tortilla chips - essentially a ceviche style shrimp cocktail that packed great acidity and bright flavors. I loved the slightly Mexican interpretation they did of this dish, a good way to wake up the palate and very reasonably priced. As we enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, the kitchen also brought out some freshly baked parker house rolls. These were soft and buttery, definitely ranking up there among the finest warm parker house and monkey bread rolls I've had in the city. Another small plate we had the cherrystone stuffies, baked clams stuffed with some pancetta, ""the holy trinity"" and lemon. The clam was tender and chewy, and the flavors very clean. Next came the spaghetti & clams dish with spicy gravy and salad on top. At first I wasn't sure what spicy gravy constituted, but it turned out to be a thick spicy tomato sauce full of garlic and brightness, absolutely amazing paired with the al dente pasta and littleneck clams. A liberal sprinkle of rocket arugula on top added a peppery and herbaceous element that totally worked. I would be delighted to have a bowl of this spaghetti and a big glass of wine any wintry day. The side of brussels sprouts with bacon and hazelnuts was also very good, especially the crunchy thick bacon bits. While the beverage menu here is pretty concise, they do have a few great and some more off the grid offerings. Both the Chardonnay from Sonoma and Gentil de Katz from Alsace were good and complimented the food well. I think The Clam is a much welcomed addition to the neighborhood and this city's food scene. It's got the right amount of class without being stuffy in the least bit. I'm looking forward to returning and working down the rest of the fantastic menu.",The Clam,4.0 star rating,$$$,Seafood

Lump crab appetizer was really good.  It comes out in two different types.   One just plane crab pieces and another little crab salad on the shell.  It was seasoned very well.  Scallop crudo melts in your mouth.  Super mild and really tasty.  After that our steamed little necks was served.  It was juicy and seasoned perfectly.  Last but not the least of our dinner was the crab and fried clam sandwich.  It came with the side of fries.  I was so full but it was delicious.  We knew we were done eating but......So the previous wasn't the last..

The wine recommendation was not very good. And most disappointing of all, the time we had to wait to get our food was excessive. It took about 30min to bring out our stuffed clams which was our first course. Then when it took another 20min (after we had finished our stuffed clams which we waited a half hour for) to bring out our clam chowder, I mentioned it was taking a while and the waitress (rather than offering to check on it or apologizing) just argued that it was an acceptable amount of time to be waiting.
