1,1JDxaio4xWG1sa71GJKHsw,Evan M.,4.0 star rating,"3 1/2 to 4 star experience. The first plus is the niceness of the employees. The next plus is all the veggie toppings looked very fresh.  I liked the looks of the pita being made when I first got there, so likewise, I ordered the buffalo chicken pita. Large-sized pita plus tap soda was about $9.50 and it was very good. If you order chicken breast or a cheese steak, the meat is cooked to order.  I'd like to try one of their breakfast pitas next. All in all, a nice lunch for under $10 in Hoboken.",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
2,VdwsBfxuBAnfavac0akKsQ,Tony R.,3.0 star rating,"Great to have one of these here in Hoboken. I was a big fan of Pita Pit's in both Colorado and Pennsylvania. Great to have one literally in my backyard. Hoboken is a transient city so the the fact that I can order a Pita and it gets tightly rolled and I can eat it on my way someplace is handy. Like a healthier burrito. While the Pita Pits don't change much, the employees are what make it or break it. On more than one occasion we have encountered employees arguing with one another and/or on their phone. Sometimes the line can get backed up and it's due to disorganization and efficiency. With some training and back-to-the-basics customer service this could be a great quick stop place in an area of Hoboken that doesn't have one.",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
3,tsJTrkoj1UdW3pnGupRsJQ,Randy L.,1.0 star rating,Went in and ordered a pita and smoothie. When they were finished making the pita they asked if I wanted a bag and then gave us the food and I walked out without them giving me the smoothie. After realizing after I was home I called and they said they would deliver for $2... Why do I need to pay for their mistake. They didn't budge or apologize so I asked for a refund. Still haven't seen anything back in my account yet so well see,Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
4,Ps8YkmeJk_1kcD4iHkcNqw,Sandy N.,4.0 star rating,"The best way to describe this place is a medeteranian Subway. They are set up like a Subway in that you pick the type of sandwich you want (chicken shawerma, gyro, veggie burger), pick your bread (white or wheat pita), pick you toppings (tomatoes, olives, lettuce, feta cheese) and finally pick your sauce. The pita they use is very thin so they are able to wrap it up just like a tortilla.I got the chicken shawerma and it exceeded my expectations. The chicken was well marinated and tender, the veggies were fresh and crisp, and the pits was soft but not soggy.I really appreciated that the owner was there working the register. He was very friendly and helped me order. He also came out and asked how the food was.",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
5,q2KRywu0jNGpH-JkBFBeUw,Mims B.,4.0 star rating,"I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but already have my go to hummus and tzatziki places in town. Walking by, their $6 daily special caught my attention. Today it was a souvlaki pita, and it was really good! They cook the chicken as you wait, and you can select from about 20 toppings, including different flavors of hummus, lettuce, a few varieties of cheese, and numerous additional sauces. My concoction was really delicious and I will definitely try other items on their menu in the future. Low brow, but exceeded expectations-- Can't beat pita pit for value and efficiency. Also, the employees were super nice and accommodating, walking me through the pita making process and all available options.",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"

7,6bPF_duyZdTaC7kfTLGX0A,Bklyn R.,1.0 star rating,No..just no. This is as authentic to gyros as taco bell is to Mexican food.  It's the Subway version of ethnic food. No just no.,Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
8,muCIs4XG-W9Ao1536UUq_Q,Jennifer V.,3.0 star rating,"Solid place to get a quick bite to eat.  I stopped in on Saturday evening around 5 - they had way too many people behind the counter, which was odd because the place was empty.  That said, they were very helpful with suggestions!I ordered the Chicken souvlaki pita and as other yelpers noted, you can pick your own toppings.  It was pretty delicious, although I wish the pita was toasted a bit more.  The toppings were definitely fresh, but the chicken could have been better.  I felt like I was eating chicken from the mall at one of those take out places.  Not bad, just not good.I will be returning to try their other types of pita - and they have soooo many yummy sauces to try!",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"

11,_PE66v3qYWzYE1NGq36J7w,Lea G.,2.0 star rating,I don't usually use the word GROSS but GROSS! My boyfriend had like a gyro sandwich with tazikki sauce and he took one bite and said it tasted like fake meat. I didn't order anything because the guy working there kept touching his nose and I felt like throwing up watching him prepare people's sandwiches. If he can do that in public god only knows what he does behind closed doors. There are better places to eat pita sandwiches in Hoboken. Try Mamouns and Flatbread Grill. Both have delicious food and both offer delivery.,Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"

14,LlQ3fqjnzozPUWR5KtnSRQ,Jess W.,5.0 star rating,"I have loved pita pit since I visited my cousin at Syracuse.  When I found out one was opening in Hoboken I was so excited!  This is a fast food, somewhat healthy restaurant where you can design your own pita.  Do not come in here expecting anything fancy.  However, the options for your pita are endless.  I personally love the felafal and the taziki sauce.  Last time I also added hot peppers, pinapple, feta cheese and olives.  It was amazing:)) They have great hours so if you need a late night meal and nothing is open this is the place to go, it is also a great lunch spot.  I will definitely be back here many times.",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
15,7EfrOqE1R0tZUTIWseg6fg,Lizchelle U.,5.0 star rating,"My second time here and Im officially obsessed!! I've never been a huge pita fan but I've never had pita like this! They're so soft, thin, and light. Perfect if you're watching calories, but if you're not you can def add so many meats, toppings, and sauces. Yum! I'm addicted to the chicken souvlaki. But my friends have tried various others and they all get a thumbs up. The meats are grilled right in front of you when you order and you can have your veggies grilled too when you have them for toppings. So many sauces to choose from, I always get a new one on the side to try besides my goto tzatziki sauce. Pita pit,I'll be back!",Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"

18,uQZoUiaUe4d7E1JwRuuhhQ,Rennie J.,1.0 star rating,Been eying this place for awhile and finally had a chance to stop in. As soon as I opened to the door I was greeted by an extremely happy and friendly staff that walked me thru the menu as a first timer at their establishment. After a few moments I finally settled on the prime rib & gyro sandwiches. There was a good variety of toppings to choose from and once the 2 sandwiches were prepared it was time to eat. The gyro sandwich was ok and middle of the road as the meat isn't freshly prepared; it's pre-sliced from a distributor. I'm used to fresh gyro fresh off the spit which is readily available down the street at Mamoun's Falafel or Turko in the City. The prime rib was completely inedible; it was like chewing an old rubber band. After 2 bites I had to throw it out.  Well it was worth a shot but I will not be going back.,Pita Pit,4.0 star rating,$,"Mediterranean,, Sandwiches,, Fast, Food"
