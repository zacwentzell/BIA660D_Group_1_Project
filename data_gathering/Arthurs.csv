Amidst the clubs, frozen yogurt spots, and juice bars is Arthur's, a decades old steakhouse and city institution.Here with a friend on a hazy Thursday night, we snagged a table outside and picked up one of Hoboken's best bargains: the Thursday night special for two. A shared appetizer, an individual entree, and a glass of beer or soda a piece for a total of $50. We split an order of calamari and each went with the junior sirloin.A plate of crisp calamari hit the table quickly, the squid just chewy enough and served with marinara and a spicy aioli. The steak (a 16oz NY strip) came a spot on medium rare, slightly charred, and well seasoned without too much salt. The pile of roasted potatoes on the side were delicious on their own and the lone pickled cherry pepper provided a bracing contrast to the rich meat.One of the best steakhouses in Hudson County",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

We were at Newport Mall, so this place was only a short 10 minute drive from there. Upon entering the restaurant, we noticed that there were only about 2-3 other tables that were occupied including ours. Not a good sign considering that it was a Thursday evening. The place had a bar-like atmosphere and we had to trek around corners over to the back of the restaurant until they seated us. The place had a distinct odor to it that I can't describe. Once we were seated, our waiter who was very hospitable took our orders. We all started off with 2 orders of the garlic bread (which was delicious, btw) and a friend and I split the ""Our Steak"" which was a Delmonico Ribeye done medium rare. We all devoured our orders once they all came. Our steak was ok-ish. A little on the salty side. And our 2 servings of vegetables tasted frozen and later microwaved. Yuck. The potatoes were especially dry. I usually don't like wasting food and I usually clean my plate, but I just couldn't here.

The wife and I ordered the same Meal which was the original steak it came with potatoes also pickles and hot red peppers. The steak is a 24 oz ribeye. The steak was cooked medium rare and was served as requested. Steak tasted just as good as I had remembered it. The last time we ate there which was about 20 years ago we ate at the downstairs portion of the restaurant but this time we sat upstairs. We showed up on a Saturday afternoon and there was only two other tables with customers. The price for the steak and the potatoes is roughly about 30 bucks. We also ordered some beers. The service was extremely quick and friendly . The menu is definitely filled with other items but when an Arthur's I stick with the steak. Also have the French onion soup you will not regret it.

The place is located in the middle of Hoboken so it's a great place to get a good dinner and then go out and enjoy the area. When you get inside its not fancy at all. Seems more like a giant pub/ bar scene. I always ask for a bucket of pickles and peppers which is on the house. When Iv gone with my family we usually get a log of garlic bread to share which is so buttery and delicious. My main course is always the crab cake with steak and potatoes.  The crab cake is plump with lots of real crab and not heavily breaded. The steak is always prime cut and cooked to how you like it.

My steak was well seasoned and my lobster came with a really nice citrus butter. My girlfriend and I ordered our steaks medium well but it seemed to be more of medium. The potatoes was the star of the dish however. Their signature potatoes and the mashed potatoes were actually pretty good and flavorful.

46,w8h69qpyHkWWWSrmMI4xpQ,Rick V.,1.0 star rating,"WORST DINNER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. READ THIS IN FULL BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO DINE HERE:Went here last night with a group of friends for dinner and drinks. To start, I arrived there quite a bit earlier than the rest of the group so I decided to go get a drink at the bar which was in the back of the restaurant down a couple of hallways. I had found this out from the only employee I could find who didn't speak any english (luckily I speak enough spanish to communicate) and ended up finding the bar in a back area of the building. I arrived at the bar, where there wasn't a bartender or any people for that matter (5:45pm on a Thursday). Someone finally came along and asked if I needed anything, I explained that I was waiting for a group of friends and I'll take a beer. About 5 minutes later I needed to make a phone call and went to step out to do so, and was stopped by the bartender, and told that I need to leave my credit card if I want to go outside otherwise I would have to close out my tab. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years I was actually embarrassed for the establishment that their staff as well as their clientele are of such low quality to have to be scrutinized over a pint of beer. I said nothing, gave her my card, and went on to make my phone call. I should also mention very little of the staff overall speak decent or any english at all, including the owner/manager.Fast forward to the meal (leaving out several other rude gestures from both the bartender slash waiteress slash food runner and what appeared to be the owner)  we all ordered 2 courses in addition to the several drink's we had all had at this point catching up. The food came out remarkably fast which is a huge red flag at a place that deems itself a ""steak house"" since all it tells you is that food isn't being prepared to order but instead coming out of soup warmers and steam tables (including the disgusting mushy strangely dark potatoes they put on every plate that taste like dirty fryer oil). 3 out of the 6 of us had to make an emergency run to the restroom. I'll repeat this in caps so that people scrolling past take a second look:3 OF THE 6 OF US HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY RUN TO THE RESTROOM.This is a common indicator of improper storage, refrigeration, contaminated food preparation, etc etc etc to say the least. Based on how dirty the dining areas and restrooms are, I am going to take an educated guess in saying that the kitchen and walk in refrigeration are littered with health code violations, stale puddles of blood, mold, bacteria, etc. The steaks were greasy, underseasoned,very lackluster in quality cuts (I ordered a ribeye and the cut wasn't even even, resulting in a very unevenly cooked steak, (a rainbow of temperatures I didn't order). All in all you get what you pay for, a 32$ ribeye which is likely junk generic choice meat hacked up in the back by some amigos in the back under the supervision of no one possessing even a serve safe certificate. I should also mention when we were at the bar moving to our table, the bartender slash waitress slash food runner had asked me if we would be paying all together, and I explained to her that, no, we are all going to pay separately. She then went to say ""well that's really annoying for me, can't you just split it at the table."" Extremely, mindblowingly unprofessional to say the least. Summary: As a chef in the industry I am embarrassed for this restaurant. This is not a steak house, it is a dirty, dingy, outdated, low quality greasy spoon with a very good location in Hoboken. Anyone who gives this place a stellar review needs to expand their horizons a bit and venture into quality establishments more often. Service: 0 out of 5 starsFood: -2 out of 5 stars (would have given them a 1 out of 5 but I subtracted 1 for each case of food poisoning my table received)Overall experience -20/5 starsWhen a family of South Americans buy an American staple business including the name, and try to suck every dime out of the place without reinvesting a cent, you have a textbook Kitchen Nightmares level establishment. I'm sure the same thing would happen if your average American family moved to Mexico and took over an existing Mexican restaurant without a clue in the world how to prepare the food or operate the establishment.

And some peoples steaks were cold so the food was probably sitting under a heat lamp for a period of time.3 peoples filet mignons were cooked well well done when they asked for medium rare.  We told Marisol about this but we did not want to send them back to have to wait another 30 minutes to get the rest of the food.Desert was served, then the coffees came out 15 minutes after the ice cream desert.Here is the kicker...CHECK YOUR BILLSince we were a large party we had to really carefully look over everything.  The quick story, we were overcharged, then she corrected it, then she overcharged us again.We noticed that she charged for an extra desert.  I brought it to her attention and at first she told me I was wrong..so i explained all the deserts and she said she would correct it.  In an effort to leave as quick as possible I gave her 6 credit cards as we were splitting it with a large party.  While she corrected one extra desert, she ADDED another one for no reason.  On top of this she told me she realized she forgot to charge for 3 espressos and added them to the bill.  So in total she removed one desert then incorrectly added one desert and 3 espressos without informing me.  Then she charged half the credit cards based on the original price.  Half way through charging the cards she recalculated the total and informed me that the last 3 credit cards would be charged about $5 more dollars each.  I have no problem paying for what we ate but we were splitting this between 6 cards so the total should have been divided accordingly..she didn't care.Then when we got the cards back and looked over the bill once again, I brought to her attention that she charged use for an extra desert after she removed the other wrong desert.  Instead of correcting the bill she just gave me CASH out of her pocket.My family is friends with the original owners and they informed us that they sold this location. So maybe its the management that is making the restaurant go down hill. This was a first time experience for a lot of the guests in our party and the way we were treated, quality of service, and quality of food specifically at the HOBOKEN location will keep all of us from coming back.  It also reflects poorly on the Arthur's name on the whole.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Honestly, great local place with great steak. They are known for their steaks, and thats pretty much it. They feature the 24 oz and the 48oz. Whether you can finish the steak or not, its pretty good old fashion steak with their amazing home fries. I am not a fan of home fries at all, but their version was pretty awesome. It always so toasty and crispy. And I totally recommend taking whatever steak you don't finish home, and repurposing it to make steak & eggs the next day (I've been doing this for like the last 8 years.) And while waiting for your steaks, make sure you ask for the pickle bucket and an order of garlic bread. I'm not sure what brine they use for the pickles, but its basically holy juice. The pickles are always so salty (the good salty), and you ALWAYS get that crunch factor. And lastly, the toasty, extra garlic-y bread, that comes serve in foil and when you open it, the steam literally blows in your face.

My boyfriend was surprised that the prices had gone up since he last went and that the garlic bread wasn't complimentary. The garlic bread was amazing though with all of the parmesan cheese! Well worth the money spent on it. Also, my other complaint was that it was just a bit hot in the restaurant and I guess I just had high expectations for eating a meal in an igloo after spending all day outside lol. My boyfriend ordered the Our Steak and I ordered the Surf and Turf. My boyfriend's steak was amazing. It was so huge (23 oz) and delicious!

Absolutely delicious, I don't believe it was a certified prime cut but it was massive, perfect Med Rare as requested. It was a bit fatty but fat adds flavor so I never mind.

Based on some of the negative reviews I was quite skeptical but nonetheless I went along with the plan. On our way to the restaurant I asked him about the change in ownership several years ago that I'd read about. He informed me that there had been some changes as far as no complimentary pickles or slaw but he insisted that the food remained consistently good. Upon walking into the restaurant there was definitely a strange odor to the joint. There was no way that I could have eaten inside so I suggested that we dine outside. Thankfully it was a beautiful spring evening. The outside seating along Washington Street was pleasant and offered a great opportunity for people watching on a busy Friday night. Now let's get to the food...we ordered the ultimate bacon for an appetizer. ""Thick cut applewood bacon"". I'm not quite sure what qualifies as ""thick cut"" but this bacon was packed full of delicious flavor. For entrees I ordered the Steak and Cake-- crab cake ($29) while my boyfriend ordered the ""Our Streak"" ($31). Both dishes came with potatoes. My Steak and Cake was cooked to perfection! The chipotle aioli on top of the crab cake really kicked the flavor up a notch. My steak was seasoned well and was nicely tender. The potatoes were a nice accompaniment to the steak as well. The service was fairly attentive and speedy. No real complaints there. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Arthur's Tavern.

It was the waiter named Sebastian who was kind enough to bring some to try before i made my decision. He was also great and always making sure we had refills for our drinks. My friend had order a steak and enjoyed it as well. The place is nice and is right on the main street in hoboken so you are right around all the other stores.

You can tell most restaurants how you like your beef and they will almost never get it right like these guys.I was greedy this night and ordered two main entrees while my bf stuck with one. The burger was delicious. Good flavor, nice and juicy, the bun was soft and fresh and the veggies on top were good too. I got a steak as well that was cooked literally to perfection. I didnt get to enjoy fully bc my eyes were bigger than my belly but hey... From what I had I was impressed.I'd give these two items high stars.However, other things bring Arthurs down... I see all the past reviews about vermin. Now while I didnt see any myself, there are one too many reports to keep me close to comfort. My food was good but I did question the cleanliness of the place with a walk by the kitchen. Bro the cockroaches in hoboken are huge and knowing these mutants were possible walking among my food is enough to make my stomach churn. ( always say your grace folks lol)Our server was friendly but she did not introduce herself upon greeting, I had to ask her her name. It was pretty clear she was just moving along the assembly line with us. She was attentive but there wasnt any real friendliness from her. And I didnt really get that from most of the staff, none of them would smile or anything.Either way, I'd come back for a perfect burger.

They said if we tasted it the would need to charge us for a glass of each, really?

Very well cooked, just wish they had a little more flavor (I like my steaks packed with more spices so I don't have to use A1). But still very good. I've gotten the 24 oz ""Our Steak"" (and devoured it all in a sitting, they didn't think I could do it), as well as the 16 oz NY Sirloin, both great choices. If you order the filet mignon, be wary that you won't be getting as much.Do yourself a favor and get two of the garlic bread - not because it come in a small portion but just because it's that good! Their garlic bread was probably one of the best I've had! Crisp on the outside, so soft and flavorful on the inside. And they wrap it in foil so it stays warm! I could eat it for days if I didn't feel like my arteries would get clogged.The sides were average - nothing special. Their onions, for example, were kind of soggy, lacking any crunch while also not being cooked to a good point of caramelization. I just think they could step it up.Service is friendly but not super attentive. The restaurant is moderately large (a couple different rooms) for places in Hoboken, and the servers aren't always nearby. It's never been very busy or bustling when I've been here, but it can still be kind of hard to find your server - when you need her, you kind of just have to wait for them to come around again.This is a very casual place - low key and old school kind of feel with plastic red and white checkered tablecloths over wooden tables.

Or even better, wear one all the time?If you answered yes to all of the questions, you might want to check out Arthur's Tavern. They have a huge steak on the menu that's weighs in at around 48 oz. That's a pretty hefty piece of meat for $50 (not too bad). They do have plenty of other items on the menu (other steaks, burgers, Italian dishes, etc) if you don't feel like eating your final meal before hibernation.The decor inside is definitely old school, old America bar-like with what feels like a step back into time. It's not a big place so I wouldn't take a party larger than 4 here unless you like to get close and personal (and perhaps rowdy).With all this charm and decent offering, the steak, though enormous, was not quite flavorful enough and a bit dry for medium rare. There was a good amount of fat on the steak but the marbling probably wasn't all that great (hence mid-lower quality cut) because the flavor of the steak was missing. I'm not the type to use anything other than some salt on a good piece of ribeye, but I was very tempted to use some of the A1 sauce they had at the table. Real shame because I wanted to love this place to death (literally).But if you just want to gorge on meat and beer, then by all means, I recommend this place. If you're looking for a better cut of steak, I'd suggest going somewhere else, paying more, for a much smaller piece.Service was friendly and helpful.

We notified the manager who expressed an ersatz concern, and identified the hole that lead to the street where the vermin may have entered.

The Arthur's steak is a 24oz steak  I think and it comes with potatoes. $30 for the order, but it is worth it. Omg is this so good. Also order their famous garlic bread. Delish. So while you wait for your order, they bring pickles and coleslaw. It is fresh and delicious. Great way to get you ready for your entree. The steak can be cooked to your liking. I like it a lil well. This steak dinner can easily be shared between 2 people, but most of my party have each gotten one order for themselves. So you can imagine how great the steak is. Ha. Definitely check out Arthur's.

The service was great, the food came out in a timely matter and the steak was delicious. I split the 48oz steak and it was more than enough for the two of us! The broccoli on the side was cooked and season well and was a great addition to the steak. Back to the steak. Juicy, tender meat on the bone. Definitely great for a date night. At first, you walk in and think this place is tiny. But you walk past the first room through a small hallway there are two more bars and rooms with even more tables. They have some TVs so it is more of a casual bar but not too casual. A friend ordered the burger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms and he said it was great.

113,ASpbaykUr7kqFJVB4O7rTQ,Kelly R.,3.0 star rating,"Came to Arthur's this past Saturday evening as first time guests. The ambiance is great with checkerboard table cloths setting the mood for a classic steakhouse. I started with the Raspberry Blush specialty cocktail that was incredibly sweet and tasted like fruit punch (not my cup of tea). We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was a perfect starter. For entrees, my filet was incredibly tender and was served with delicious mashed potatoes. It was a very good steak and beat my expectations. The steak and cake was just as good, however, the crab cake was not flavorful and probably not the best menu item. Would recommend sticking to the steaks. Our only concern was after our entrees had been cleared it took 30 minutes for our server to come back to our table. We were dying for some espresso and dessert. But, the clock kept ticking and we could not get our servers attention - and we did not want to be rude. I never complain, but 30 minutes waiting around was a little bit of a night ruiner especially when we had arranged for plans after dinner. When the server finally came over and stared at us, we asked if we could please see a dessert menu and order after dinner drinks as well. I was very disappointed and would normally take the servers side if it was during dinner rush. Oh well, it happens. But overall was mediocre and probably won't be back again.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Didn't really like the orange marmalade glaze with a kick of pepper. But other people at my table enjoyed it. I still give this place 4 out of 5 stars. Their steak for 2 is huge 48oz marbled ribeye cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good value when you compare it to other steakhouses. Their signature potato side was superb.

Hubby and I ordered the calamari starter, french onion soup and Arthur's steak. The place was empty at 6:30pm on a Friday night so we sat outside on the patio area for some good ol fashioned people watching. Calamari - Pretty standard. Good but not nothing to write home about.French onion soup - Piping hot, gooey and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the cheese. After about the fourth bite, it got a little bit too rich, if you know what I mean. Steak - Yelpers aren't kidding when they said this steak is huge. Between the two of us, we only finished about 2/3 and even that was a struggle. It comes with a side (either french fries, griddle fries or a baked potato) and a couple of hot peppers. The steak was good, but I definitely wouldn't consider it to be ""steakhouse"" quality. It came out medium (we ordered it medium rare) but had a pretty tasty char on the outside which we both enjoyed. Total bill came out to about $70 which I think is expensive for Hoboken, especially considering the fact that we shared an entree.

The menu has always been basic but we never minded as everyone always knew what they were ordering ( steaks, ribs, garlic bread and of course their famous potatoes) it was always a pleasant experience.  Service was good and food was consistently great. I remember this place allllways being full and having to wait for a table. Well after living abroad for a couple of years and coming back to NJ, Arthurs was on my list of stops. What a mistake. We were a party of 6 and the place was pretty much empty so we got a table fast. Right away there were cleanliness issues. The iconic red and white table cloths were beyond sticky and nasty. Upon request our server did clean it up a bit. After placing the orders, we waited like forever for the food to arrive, which made no sense as the place was pretty empty. Finally it arrives. I was a bit disappointed.  The quality was not what I was expecting. More greasy than savory, but we just kept eating until the worst happened! A big mouse ran back and forth cornered by our table. We all kept our cool so that the other patrons would not realize what was going on. When we signaled over to our server, his response was ""yeah that happens at restaurants, especially when they have outdoor seating.""  What????? I could not believe it. We had to ask him to transfer us to another table, cause he did not even ofer to do that. He than says ""sure, I could move you guys over to that table, just do me a favor and each of you grab your plates and walk over. If i have to do it it will take longer"" Incredible!

Garlic bread... so good! The beer, very large. The steak, well, if you are a steakhouse and can't do steak right... maybe you should become a vegan restaurant. The swordfish, well, one of my friends got it, and it was her first time trying swordfish. She was disappointed, it was overcooked. Fortunately for her, this is not a seafood restaurant. Dessert on the other hand, my boyfriend refused to share his, if that says anything. I was disappointed to discover that the cappuccino machine was broken.

Although he did say he had not gone there in years but he did remember that back then it was the place to go in Hoboken. So we all decided on Arthur's, When we arrived I immediately noticed that there was a weird smell in the air, it wasn't until I read another review that I figured out what the smell was, Mice droppings. Now that I think about it, it makes me want to THROW UP!Meanwhile back at the ranch we sit down and I also noticed that all the silverware was dirty, the place was extremely outdated but I again ignored the warning signs. We ordered appetizers, Additionally I and a colleague ordered Rib Eye sandwiches. 8hrs later I was at the emergency room with food poisoning, and coincidently so did my colleague. I went through sheer hell simply because I ignored the signs that were so evident. The NJ Health Dept should shut this place down before someone suffers a worse fate then what me and my colleague went through. If you find this a little difficult to believe then simply visit Arthur's yourself, walk in and take a whiff and you will quickly be reminded of my review. This place is GROSS.

This is when the waiter informs us that patrons using the outdoor seating must at least order an appetizer, or they have to sit inside at the bar. Initially, I was slightly annoyed that we weren't told this when we were first seated, but we decide to stay and order some garlic bread for the table.Best impromptu appetizer ever! Even though we weren't very hungry, we couldn't stop eating the garlic bread. While the frozen mango margarita was drinkable, it was nothing to rave about; it had to be continuously mixed to keep its consistency.

My husband wanted steak. I was not that hungry. I went since he wanted steak. He ordered salmon rare (while he makes the best anywhere) with veggies and substituted potatoes for rice. He also got a wedge salad soaked in dressing and cheese and a beer. He liked his salad. I could see he didn't care for the salmon. I tasted it. The salmon tasted like raw chewy badness with a sweet orange marinade...horrible. And I just had a tiny bite and nearly spit it out it was so terrible.  I ordered a side of mashed potatoes and a salad (that cost $8 and looked so small, wilted, and overly dressed and unappetizing that I did not even try it). It looked so unappetizing. Nor did he, and he loves any greens. My mashed potatoes were delicious as they were buttery and well salted. His fingerling potatoes quite bad and his veggies the frozen kind...basically nothing to write home about. It was the worst meal of my life (minus the mashed potatoe side) for $50 and no steak!!!

I've never sat in the same section twice actually. I'm somewhat tried and true as I have only ever ordered the junior sirloin. This trip was *slightly* different.My boyfriend and I split the fried calamari appetizer and we thought it was very good. They rings were cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce was good. We each had salad next (Caesar for me, wedge for him) and I really liked it. There was enough dressing to coat the entire salad without it drowning in dressing. I'm not sure if the dressing is house made or not but it was good. As I said before, I of course got the junior sirloin and added a side of steamed veggies. I ate most of it and cut off pieces of fat that probably equated to 1 cup. I don't think that's too terrible especially when it's just trim on the outside. And those skillet potatoes. Oh em gee!

I can't tell you about the other entrees though, haven't tried anything else...I'm a creature of habit sometimes.   Arthur's can be a fun place if this is your town, but there are better steak places in Hoboken.  If you choose one of them...you'll pay, yes you'll pay, so if you're looking for a good steak without losing your paycheck, Arthur's isn't a bad decision...",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Or maybe he said celery. Not entirely sure. He's a nice, young Indian man with hair and is doing decently well for himself. He hit me up one day telling me how he was dying to get some meat in his cavity. So after, we did that, we went to Arthur's to get some steak. We were greeted at the front and then taken to the back and were told that the area was for the common folk. A bit odd, but the area seemed fine enough.As my friends and I sat down, I couldn't help but notice that my Indian friend was staring into the distance. He seemed lost in thought. Then, out of nowhere, a man approaches us and greets himself as our waiter. We had gone on a Thursday and luckily for us, there was a 2 for $50 deal which included steaks, an appetizer, and drinks for two. The four of us ordered two deals and an order garlic bread and began to chow down. The garlic bread was good, not too greasy. I only wish my friends would've left some for later. We got the calamari and nacho appetizers. The calamari was solid and the nachos were good too, even though I am not the biggest fan of nachos. As for steaks, my friends ordered the NY Strip, while I treated myself a bit to the rib-eye. The steak was very good and juicy, but I think there was a bit too much char flavor for my liking. I don't know how the strip compared, but my friends all seemed to be enjoying it a lot. The potatoes, onions, and peppers on the side were also quite good. The portions were huge and I had about half the steak and a mess of potatoes left to eat later on. The deal is great, with more than enough food for 2 people.

He's a nice, young Asian man with an average haircut but is doing rather well for himself. Well enough that he has been to Arthur's previously and strongly recommended this place to me over the other steakhouses in Hoboken. Once you walk into the place it seems rather small with a grand smell. That is until they take you to the hidden back wing which can hold about 60 people and were told was only for large parties. As my friends and I sat down, we noticed a middle-aged man standing in the corner next to our table, quietly observing us. I wondered for a little while, ""Who is this man? Why is he standing right next to us?"". I am quite sure that he heard all our conversations but I ended up paying him no mind. A good 5-10 minutes later, this stand-in-the-corner man walks up to our table and starts to welcome us. Turns out he was our waiter. We ended up ordering the 2 for $50 deal, which is available only on Thursdays. Of course, us young kids, with new jobs and the fresh excitement of finally have the means to over-indulge, made sure to order a garlic bread appetizer. Whether it was the actual bread, or the fact that we all had an opportunity to finally have a nice juicy steak in our mouths, the garlic bread was pretty fantastic. I highly recommend trying it. Along with the bread, we also got the nachos and calamari as appetizers, which happened to come with the 2 for $50 deal. These were also good, but did not compare to the bread.Now on to the steak.

We also shared a salad with walnuts/cranberries/blue cheese, as well garlic bread.  No major complaints, maybe the dressing of the salad had too much vinegar.Arthur's prices have  gone up over the years, but they are still less than the typical Ruth Chris/Old Homestead pricing.  Expect to pay in the 'twenties' for your steak. Also, this is the time of year where they compete with all the outdoor tables in Hoboken, so it's less busy and much easier to get a table, as well as get the complete attention of your waiter.  Old trick. save about 1/4 of your steak / potatoes to bring home.

Naturally I choked it up to an ""off day"" as any decent establishment is allowed one every now and then. Now with two kids, my wife and I visited Arthur's once more for old time's sake a few weeks ago. Service was standard, not spectacular but nothing to complain about. Then came the inconceivable...my wife and I were staring at two poorly cooked steaks with bleeding pulses on the inside and crunchy charred patches on the outside. Silly, we thought taking more bites of the steak would bring back the magic we once tasted from this place. Why do people do such foolish things...take one bite, feel dissatisfied and continue eating hoping they can chomp out a miracle? LOL, proof that my wife and I were really trying to not dislike Arthur's I guess. And the roasted potatoes were as bland as I never imagined they could be. Maybe their spice racks were abducted that night. Maybe sautéed onion cores and two lone slices of pepper helps them pay the rent. What it did was make this visit my absolute last. I almost had to step out of the place and make sure it was Arthur's and not Charlie Brown's. Sad because once upon a time I used to tease my wife about eating that 48 ounce steak.

On their homepage ""The former Hoboken and New Brunswick locations are no longer affiliated with Arthur's Tavern."" They do use the same menu's, the same staff and the same red and white checkered table cloths. This was a tough call on the rating. The food is usually hit or miss and so is the service but my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth.As with every trip to Arthur's, the food is either okay or bad. The ribeye will be a great cut of beef for the price or nothing but fatty grizzle. That is just how it works there.  Arthur's is a place that can be a good bang for the buck but do not go there looking for dry aged meat or prime meat for that matter.Anyway, my last visit was late March of 2014. It was a Saturday. Our server, Brian P., was awful.  Usually servers are bad or good and that is the way the restaurant world works. But this guy was in the ""should I get the manager involved?"" class.Here's what happened. From the very beginning he was just a bad server. Could not get the orders right, did not know the menu, did not know what beers were available, etc. Just clueless. We asked for garlic bread. My friend mentioned that last time we were here we had cheese melted on the garlic bread; could they accommodate and do this again? Brian P.'s response ""No way. It doesn't work that way. The kitchen would not know how to handle that request.""  Ok fine, regular garlic bread.  As soon as he leaves the room a friend quip's ""How dare we ask for the complicated task of melting cheese on bread!""  The whole table erupted in laughter. That was ridiculous. Of course you can accommodate. It is melting cheese on bread not truffles or edible gold flakes.  And if you were not sure, you should ask the kitchen first. You did not know the menu anyway.Throughout the whole service, he would interrupt at the worst times and would butt in to our private conversations and jokes. A friend asks if we had all seen a certain movie and he answers.  Not only that, he gives away the ending. No one had answered yet; thank you for ruining the movie for half the table.And that continued through the whole evening. Nothing but bad  timing and butting in. But it was not until the end of the dinner that it got from bad to worse. My friends and I were discussing our next charity walk/run and Brian P. comes over and points his finger at my friend, who is overweight, and says ""There is no way you will be involved with this! haha"". I was mortified. My friend did not travel from out of state to be insulted by some jerk. My friend was good about it and smiled. As soon as Brian P. left the room we all apologized and asked if he wanted us to get the manager involved. My friend said no.  His actions went beyond rude and crossed over into insulting and mean spirited. I do not know what this guy's deal was. Perhaps he thought not knowing the menu, butting into private conversations, and insulting patrons is how servers are suppose to act. Maybe he never has dined at an establishment before.

I'm actually surprised I just got to review this place now because I would've a long time ago if I was into writing reviews back int he day. I usually will stick with what I know and love. And what I usually always get is the garlic bread to start off with. It's toasted and when they bring it out it's all wrapped in foil and then when you release it you see the fresh warm steam come up and then the strong garlic smell hits my olfactory glands like a rocky punch and then it makes my mouth salivate ready to take a bite. Its soft and does not skimp on the garlic and butter. The steak I usually go for is the 24 ounce medium rare with their traditional cooked potatoes on the side. The meat is so juicy and tasty that only a few droplets of A-1 is needed. The homemade potatoes works so well with the steak that it's probably one of the best duo's since Batman and Robin. To fight off the protein inducement you encounter you'll need the carbohydrate potato that's soft as mash potatoes but thick like waffle fries.

A steak that has a taste that lingers in your mouth, perfectly juicy... practically having the steak kinda melt in your mouth... have you ever had a steak like that? This is exactly it and they've done it right with the perfect amount of burn (light to tasteless burn with a perfect crisp... what a bonus!) I've been to steakhouses across the Hudson and I can say that the quality is comparable and costing a lot less than $45. Everything else I've had there (crab cakes, French Onion Soup, and their salads) were of above-average quality and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. I will definitely recommend the French Onion Soup for an appetiser. It doesn't matter where, but French Onion Soup is my favourite thing to have before a delicious steak of high quality! Service is comparable to an attitude of New York City with a mix of North Jersey attitudes. The people working there are friendly, especially during football games. There'll usually be some funny banter going on among the people that work there and... well, if you know how New York City likes sports, you can apply those characteristics here. Otherwise, service is pretty good and I have nothing bad to say about that either. Finally, atmosphere is average, speaks a lot of what's across the Hudson and what's a tavern like. I weigh the atmosphere low on my ratings, but this is the only thing I have some negative feedback to say. I get it, winters are cold and summers are hot. All year long, in there, it's hot. You can tell where I'm going at when it comes to dining here in the summer - it is sweating and smoking hot. Just noting that while I type this up in 45°F weather. Overall...OK, let's get this straightforward... you're here... for the steak. Got it? Hah. But yes, if you're in Hoboken and in the mood for steaks, there's no reason to pass up Arthur's Tavern!",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"
172,Hr01GhSPumkMNgjSPKZhkg,Tess D.,3.0 star rating,"On one hand: It's an institution in Hoboken but they need to step it up. Steak can be very grisly and place looks and smells like it has not been cleaned since the day they opened. On the other hand: I love old school restaurants and there aren't many left in town.  So what keeps me coming back? - Delicious potatoes are cooked in beef drippings.- Excellent pickled veggies are no longer free but get them because they cut through all the fat.- Burger is top notch. I prefer it nowadays to their steak - especially when it is rare and topped with blue cheese. They have hygiene issues but I tell myself they are a steakhouse so their burger mix should have high enough turnover to be fresh. - Have a sweet tooth? Their chocolate mousse cake is always fresh, has good chocolate flavor and I love the chocolate crumb crust. When I need a chocolate fix I sometimes order a slice on its own.Definitely worth a try especially if you are in the mood for an old school experience without having to drop a hundred bucks on a steak.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

They call themselves a steakhouse (in addition to a tavern) but their steaks don't really make the grade. This isn't a special-occasion-let's-go-out-for-a-nice-meal steakhouse. It's more like a it's-the-middle-of-the-week-and-I'm-craving-red-meat steakhouse. Which is OK, as long as you set your expectations accordingly.I went this week for Monday ""Burger Night"". This is admittedly a good deal. You get a burger with up to 3 toppings (for which they'd normally charge) and fries for $6.99. It's not a small burger and they don't skimp on the fries. But the burger I had was just ""fine"". It would not make it onto any of my best burger lists, that's for sure. The beef itself could have been better seasoned. The fries were actually the highlight of that meal; they were crisp and delicious.The space is a bit dated. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean and functional.

185,JqjtdewQEbvVUsB-6hSVQw,Tyler R.,3.0 star rating,"First and foremost, I recommend you sit outside.  The atmosphere is significantly different - but be aware, outside starts packing up tables at 8pm, a little early by Hoboken standards.  (I assume this is different on the weekend, we went on a Tuesday night.)Inside lies a labyrinth of halls and tables and doors and people and...well, the place is actually a lot larger than it seems from the outside.  If you sit inside (which we did) it kind of feels like you are on an indoor picnic, as each table has red and white checkered picnic-esque tablecloths and interesting lighting fixtures made of giant plastic (no labels) beer bottles.Instead of bread, you get homemade coleslaw and pickles.  The slaw is light and vinegar based, and very good with a little pepper on it.  Pickles are decent, not bad, not over the top.One of the most attractive things about the place is that you can get a beer the size of your face and/or head.  I opted for a pint over the facebeer (yeah, I know, booo) but know there are much larger sizes to choose from.Foods:-- 24 oz steak - ribeye - not off the charts, but again, pretty good for the price.-- Chicken Sandwich - yeah I know, who goes to a steak place and gets a chicken sandwich?  This guy.  That's right - my girlfriend is the one that got the steak.And you know what?  I wouldn't have had it any other way.  Honestly, the chicken sandwich with mushrooms and sauteed onions is the way to go, I can't remember simple chicken tasting so good.  And the mushrooms...I don't want to know how much butter and salt they had in them but I was impressed.  Absolutely delicious.So, overall, good place.  I'll be back, for the chicken and a slightly bigger beer.  Not a real date place, but a good for a steak (or chicken sandwich) on the fly with a facebeer to wash it down.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

The reviews were blah, the decor was dated, & the fact that I hadn't ever noticed it while walking up & down Washington Street couldn't be a good sign.They readily welcomed our group of 12 for lunch without a reservation (though I should mention that the restaurant had maybe 3 other patrons at 11:30am on a Friday). I can't imagine there's ever a wait here ... which is good or bad, depending on how you look at it.The food was better than I expected. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was tasty & just moist enough -- not dry or burned. My plate came with a giant mound of fries, which proved to be just a little too much food for me. Most of my companions got either burgers or salads. Predictably, the men all finished their burgers, and the women struggled to clear their plates. I think I ate half of my sandwich, and then gave up on the bread & just ate the chicken of the second half, along with maybe 2/3 of the fries. Everyone was happy with the quality of the meal & the attentiveness of the server.The food is decent; nothing spectacular, nothing terrible. And the portions are very substantial. With that said, I think the food is a bit heavy for standard lunch fare. Prices are good though, so if you're ok with leaving half your meal on your plate (or willing to take it home), you're going to love this place. As for me ... I can't see myself coming back here on my own, but my day won't be absolutely ruined if we chose this place for another group outing.(Oooh, and if you're trying to have a good work lunch, maybe go for something a little lighter.

I requested the steak medium rare but it was medium to well done which was a let down.  I think instead of cooking a whole steak and slicing it, they cook it kabob style (I had big chunks of steak on the salad) which might be the reason.  It was flavored nicely but could use improvement in the done-ness area.  This is a cheap, decent steakhouse that has some good dishes.  If the prices were higher, it'd probably be a 2 star--it's a really great value!",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

No self-respecting steakhouse offers A1 and if asked for it, should beg the customer to not use it.3.

I've been here three times and each time the food and service was consistent. It's all about the garlic bread, chili, and steaks! Arthur's is known best for their 24 oz steak for $24.95. Great value - everything on the menu excluding the steaks are under $20. A thick Delmonico cut, some complain about the fat but I don't mind it. I could never finish it especially with the side of potatoes so I bring it back and make steak sandwiches the next day. The side of potatoes is okay; a little more crunch wouldn't hurt. The garlic bread and chili deserves a paragraph of its own. The garlic bread is warm, buttery, and garlicky. I could eat a loaf by myself... but I don't because I need to leave room for the chili. The bowl of chili is filling and comforting. Topped with tons of cheese and chopped scallions. So beefy. So chunky. So homey. You won't see any liquid here. What would've made this chili perfect is a slow, creeping heat of cayenne.A couple more dishes worth mentioning: Arthur's also cooks a mean 1 1/4 pound lobster for $18.95 with side of potatoes. Only downhill is there are no corns to be found. The full rack of bbq ribs is mouth-watering as well. For a tavern, the ribs are worth every penny. The French onion soup is great too. Not the best but better than most places. I like this place a lot. It's similar to J&R's steakhouse. FYI - Don't be afraid to celebrate your birthday here.

The 24 oz. steak comes cooked the way you love it with sautéed wheel potatoes.  I have never had a bad steak at Arthur's.

To drink, I simply stuck with the soda as did my partner.My sandwich came out decently prepared and was right on the money.. but nothing beyond that. I didn't feel particularly blown away - maybe I should have ordered a steak? The garlic bread was very good though, I would definitely recommend that as your appetizer coming in.The folks nearby our table were very attentive. There was not a lot going on, so the staff was able to spend time with us every time it seemed as if we needed something. Prices were meh.

Oddly enough, for a restaurant that specializes in s teak, Arthur's prepared a very good Lobster on the nights that it is a special. I have probably ordered the lobster here at least 10 times without disappointment. That's something I can't say about other establishments that pride themselves in seafood.And how can I not mention that beers come in 1 liter mugs. That way when you get pulled over driving home and the police officer asks how much you had to drink, you can tell him with a straight face ""only two beers officer"" while being drunk off your ass.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Incredibly. Cheesy.  Don't let that monster layer turn you off.I was also told to try Arthur's famous potatoes.  They slice potatoes and fry them in oil.  They weren't bad actually, but I was hoping for them to be a little crunchy.  The potatoes were pretty soft, but still full of flavor.I told them to cook my hamburger ""medium"" yet the meat came out kind of soggy and QUITE PINK.  Maybe they just undercook here?? I didn't think my burger tasted that great.  My friend ordered some sort of reuben sandwich, and it was absolutely huge.  The sandwich meat, topped with a mountain of cheese, made the sandwich look bigger than his head, and he was having a hard time eating it.Overall, come here for some decent American food and friendly atmosphere... especially if you like really cheesy foods.  And potatoes!",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

In addition, it now looks like you have to request the free bowl of pickles.Part of the enjoyment of dining here was the feeling you were at a Hoboken institution that was more than just the sum of the food and service; it was about history etc.  Refusing to honor the promises of the business (which this is merely a continuing) ruins that feeling for me.  I don't feel like returning.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

I guarantee you'll either want to throw up afterward, or  feel lethargic. For Arthur Steakhouse occasions i suggest wearing sweatpants, 1 size larger deep Vneck t-shirt, and flip flops. Buttons will hold you back, so sweatpants will keep you nice and classy and feeling loose. The deep V-neck isn't deep enough unless it's down to your navel.With a V so deep you won't have to worry about hanging any napkins on your shirt, just wipe away the stains as they land on your chest or belly.

And basically gets it's own star out of the three for it.  As far as my steak? I asked for medium rare.. I got well done.  It was so well done that it was hard for me to cut it with the knife.

Ordered drinks, burger, and bowl of chili with onions.  For us hoboken residents, one of the reasons we have gone to Arthurs is that they start you out with pickles and cole slaw on the table.  Well now they charge for the cole slaw.   I had to remind the waitress after 15 minutes to bring the drinks over.   i then get my bowl of chili with wrong toppings.   All in all i wouldn't go back to this place since there are many many other choices in the neighborhood.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Mine medium; the other 2, well done.I barely touched my salad, unfortunately. Steak was VERY red [like rare], the caesar dressing was extremely oily, and the salad just didn't look that fresh. Even the girls who ordered well done got their meat very red.Luckily, the waitress and manager were kind of enough to remove 2 salads from the bill, which was very generous and much appreciated.

However, it was still fairly tasty for being overcooked. It came with a side of fries (which were really good). My coworker had the steak and potatoes. He destroyed his steak but barely touched his potatoes. He said they weren't seasoned well.Perhaps its because I didnt' expect much from this place which is why i shrugged the meal off. My colleague kept raving about the steaks and was so excited to come here. I wasn't in the mood for steak so when we sat down and I saw the rest of the menu I wasn't surprised.

That is one of Arthur's hidden strengths in its setup, the casualness and homey atmosphere.I come to this place probably 2 to 4 times a year, and every time I go here I never leave disappointed. I typically start off with an appetizer the Garlic Bread, which is cheesy, buttery, toasty and soft at the same time and of course garlicky! When ordering this, don't expect a measly amount of butter on your bread, but bread with just the right amount before you probably hit butter overload. The French Onion Soup here is also pretty good. The best part is of course the cheese, which is melted all over the top and around the bowl itself! The soup was not to soupy and not to thick, just about right.And last but not least, the STEAK!!!What makes me coming to this place over and over again is the amazing crust they have been able to create on this awesome cut of beef. The crust, the juiciness, the doneness, and the fat! Yes the fat! Something I usually avoid anywhere else but here. For a piece of steak that is around $20, I would actually pay more if that was the case.

Before my salmon came out the waiter brought me the complimentary slaw and pickles which I proceeded to gobble up with delight. No slaw is as good as my moms, but this wasn't as offensive as I usually find slaw and I ate most of it. The salmon was simply seasoned and came with a dressing free salad. Perfect! I asked for it medium because as a Cape Cod transplant I find overcooked seafood to be one of the most unforgivable offenses a restaurant can commit. The potatoes reminded me of my grandma's and were soooooo good! By far the highlight of the meal was the terrific service.

I recently found out that this place changed ownership..So I decided to drop in for steak, garlic bread & chilli, after not having been there in about 8 months.. I must tell all of you: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! 1) THE STEAK:  The seasoning was off, from the usual awesome flavoring.  Additionally, as a few reviewers on here have mentioned, the meat was cooked unevenly.  One side was medium-rare, while the other was well-done.  It is also possible that the quality of the meat was slightly lower than what I remember, although I can't say with 100% certainty.  What I can say for sure though, is that the $7 increase in price of the steak, coupled with the dissapointing preparation, makes the trip out to Arthur's for its steaks, not worth the effort.2) THE CHILI: Not as tangy as before, but good.  What sucked was that they've cheapened up & no longer bring the shredded cheddar & cilantro in seperate plates so you can enjoy generous amounts.  Instead, they just garnish the top of the chili bowl with some cheddar & cilantro.3)  The GARLIC BREAD:  Not as garlicky as it used to be..Also, not enough oil in the bread.  This used to be my absolute favorite garlic bread in the world.  Unfortunately, times have changed. All in all, i'm sorry to say that I won't be going back.***BTW- Yelp has become a pathetic money maker for its founders..Their whole ""softaware recommendation system"" is B.S...The perfect example of this is when they leave your good to mediocre to great reviews, but ""filter"" out your bad ones.  This is inexcusable.  If it really wasn't about the money they're making off of these businesses, they would either filter you completely or not.  Having it both ways proves they're a bunch of hypocrites***",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

337,PDi1kw9vFtoUFg-fL_TVbQ,Se U.,4.0 star rating,"Ate at this location a few times now. They have another one down near New Brunswick, NJ and the steak, pickles, and peppers are exactly the same. Last time I ate here was a couple of weeks ago. Have only been here on a weeknight so don't know how busy or crowded it gets on a weekend, but note that they don't take reservations.Seating areas in the front of the restaurant seem a little bit more spacious than the back 'tavern' area. There is a bar in the back and it gives the vibe of a bar that serves steak but the price is decent and the food is good so can't really complain too much about spacing. I've only tried their steaks. They come in regular size (I think 24oz) and supersize (I think 48oz). Never came here hungry enough to try the 48oz, but the 24oz with the potatoes and pickles/slaw will make you at the least not hungry anymore. The fat and cut of their steaks gives the meat a nice flavor. They also use some kind of house seasoning. Steak has been juicy every time I've had it; both Hoboken & New Brunswick. The pickles and the round spicy pickled peppers are delicious of course. I've stolen a taste of the sirloin and shrimp as well as the reuben sandwich and they were good and edible, but nothing outstanding. Service is good and pretty quick, since the area isn't too big and they crank out the steaks.Their signature steak I give a (3.5 / 5 ). The rest of the stuff on the menu is there for the losers that can't handle all the meat. I give it a 4 star because the servings are big, they serve 1 liter beers, their house wine is filled to the brim of the glass, and overall, their drinks are reasonably priced.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

My gf ordered it though and finished every bit.Instead I went with the blue cheese burger. I actually expected the blue cheese to be already mixed into the meat (as they did at this other restaurant I went to). But here, there was a layer of melted blue cheese on the burger. The burger itself was NOT seasoned, I kinda like my meat seasoned. I drowned the meat in catsup and this other sauce on the table.Call me light weight but i've never had a burger this big before. I managed to finish it though (since I didn't have a proper breakfast or lunch). I was disappointed that they didn't serve fries. They have homefries which to me is not quite the same thing.Needless to say i was stuffed. the price of burger was decent also. I went on a saturday night around 8pm...we had to wait about 20mins for the table but the place simmered down pretty quickly after that...so i guess 7-8:30pm is the high time.

Delicious, but when a person enters a steak house, quite frankly, they should order steaks and nothing else. We ordered the Farmer's French Onion Soup and was given one spoon. No problem. My server was nowhere to be seen so I asked a different waiter standing 2 feet away from us who was watching TV for a spoon. He looked confused that a customer would ask him for something, looked disheveled, looked around and responded with, ""I'll tell your waiter you need a spoon.""

I've had it for the past 4 years I've lived here, and it's never disappointed. For my main course, I ordered an Arthur's Junior Sirloin with potatoes, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My guest got one of Arthur's cheeseburgers with pepperjack cheese that was also cooked to order. Just like the garlic bread, the dishes were cooked with the same quality that you've come to expect from a Hoboken staple.It's easy to see why Arthur's has been in Hoboken for as long as I can remember. It is definitely one of the best steaks and burgers in Hoboken for a modest price. It's a great representation of the saying, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it.""",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Grew up in Morristown going to the one out there.   Excellent burgers and roast beef on rye. And the steak is one of the best I've had...don't get me wrong, I love a good $60 steak from del frriscos or Lugers, but this steak is so juicy and full of flavor, you forget you only paid 25 bucks for it.   Last month had 2 large gatherings with friends.

Yes you get a lot but that doesn't mean you want it.  We ate there on a Saturday night around 6:30 and it was packed.  I guess the prices lure the crowds in because the service and food don't.  All our dinners were served cold after waiting a half hour for it and one fish dinner had an odd taste.  My Reuben sandwich was ok but cold.  The steak sandwich was just huge chunks of meat and the burgers were average.  The famous potatoes must have been famous for being awful. They were mushy and lacked any distinct flavor.   Waiter never came by to check on us and we had to end up going to the bar to get our own drinks.  I am sure my review will not put them out of business but just be aware of what to expect.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

I ordered a 12oz Aurthur's Junior (I'm not too sure about the name of the dish) sirloin steak with mushrooms on the side and couldn't have been more satisfied with my choice. The meat was cooked a perfect medium. It was juicy and tender. Although the potato sides were not of much interest to me.

Next thing I noticed was the menu was changed! the 24oz steak just says OUR STEAK which i had to ask is this the 24oz steak? and the price went up AGAIN to $28. damn it use to be $24. before that it was $19. And the 48oz steak wasnt there. it was on a different specials menu. Shrimp cocktail not on the menu any more! i finally asked when did they make the changes. Apparently there are new owners or management. Ok a successful Tavern for so many years and the newbies make all these changes. I was thinking if they changed the steak too. New Flat Screen TVs. Place jujst looks different.Finally the steak came. Steak was just as good as before...but the Atmosphere is different. Stupid new OWNERS!!!! $28 for the steak is a bit pricey and just touches the higher price steak places whcih are better. $24 was great for what it was. but $28??? looks like i wont going back as often.really sucks with the changes. it use to be a great bargain.,Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

We were looking for something nice and easy but tastes great at the same time. Hmmm, we thought. What could that be??? So, we asked SIRI, the genderless voice on the iPhone, and she brought up Arthur's Tavern. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a go. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly with no wait. Remember, this is a Saturday night... There was plenty of room for seating. However, of all of the good spots, our host seated us between 2 large groups. Not my choice of seating but we made it work. After reviewing the menu, we ordered right away. We both ordered burgers, I had bacon on mine and my friend had no bacon. We thought our burgers came with cole slaw. However, we realized they only came with fries. After informing us that the burgers did not come with slaw, we were very surprised when our waitress surprised us with 2 free helpings of cole slaw!!! For free!! Talk about great service!! After precisely 10 minutes, we received our food. Let me tell you, the burgers were TO DIE FOR!!! they were excellent. So seasoned to perfection. i'm talking mouth watering. Amazing. The fries were good as well, however they were just fries. Nothing to rave about. After the meal, our server brought us the check in a very timely manner. We were out of there and on our way to get some ice cream in no time.

My favorite part of the dining experience has got to be the pickles and peppers you get at the beginning of the meal. Skip the iceberg & tomato salad, it's nothing special (inferior to most steakhouses). The burger, however, is recommended (i've gotten the blue-cheese burger, it's real nice).

When I turned right on Washington Street, I almost ran over this HOT ESTAP dude (he was cute)... and the parking situation looked grim.  However, I spotted a space and finally took it.  Whatttayakno!?  The space was literally about 50 feet from Arthur's Tavern.  We didn't have to circle around for parking either!My friend and I walked in and was greeted by a hostess.  She directed us to the main dining room, where we were greeted by a 2nd host.  He was foine.  We were seated at this table that was covered with red/white checkered tablecloth.  The place looked like it was great for groups, and there were televisions on top of the bar for those just in to drink beer and watch the games.  Our server's name was Carolyn.  I ordered a Corona Light and my friend tried to order a Blue Hawaii, but they did not have Blue Curacao likka.  I got cold because I'm an old lady and the table was directly in front of the air conditioner.  We asked to be moved, but that meant we had to change servers.  Carolyn was fine with it, joking that she wanted to go home anyway.  Then came Roger.  I already liked his name.  Do you know Prince's name is Roger Nelson?  Anyways... our server, Roger, had this confident gait.... he walked like he's packin'.  He is also hella foine.  Too bad he wasn't on the menu.My evening is getting better.  I ordered the junior sirloin (12 oz) and my friend ordered the petite sirloin (8oz) with the shrimps (and came with an olive oil-cilantro sauce).  I ordered my meat medium rare.  She ordered hers rare.  When the food came in, my steak was perfect--pink, juicy, tender, and oh so flavorful.  Hers, on the other hand, looked medium rare.  She was clearly disappointed by the done-ness of her meat.  As the maid of honor, I felt it was my duty to make sure that the bride-to-be is as close to being stress free before the wedding... so I asked if her food could be redone.  Another server suggested that she get her steak ""black and blue""--the steak is seasoned and charred quickly, while leaving the inside rare.  When her replacement meat came in, it looked like it was still moving when she cut through the steak.  I appreciate that they didn't give us much resistance for this request.  She was clearly happy and even finished the entire steak.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pink meat and wish Roger could've given me some of that special sauce that came with my friend's meal.  The steak did come with pickled hot red peppers which was a glorious compliment to the steak.  I felt like I was eating an upgraded taco without the tortilla.   They are also proud of their burgers and list of specials including a filet mignon sandwich and Manhattan clam chowder.  4.5 stars for the steak and 0.5 stars for Roger = 5 stars for Arthur's Tavern!",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Every table starts off with complimentary pickles, tomatoes, peppers and sauerkraut. What class! Unfortunately, that's about where it stops. The spartan decor can be forgiven for the restaurant's nature, but not the styrofoam plates. Service is decent for a steakhouse, but certainly nothing special - that's left for the food.Their 24oz. Delmonico Rib-Eye can be a bit gristly, but is juicy, packed with flavor, and always cooked to order, plus it comes with some pretty decent home fries. If you want the perfect steak, you'll have to go to Manhattan or to Peter Luger's for a dry-aged porterhouse, but Arthur's isn't trying to compete with those $40/steak bigboys. Afterall, a side of onions (greasy, not caramelized) is a mere 99 cents! Add in a side of mushrooms (greasy but cooked just right) and you've get yourself a great meal. Although not as perfect as their signature steak, Arthur's offers excellent burgers, ribs and a slew of decent deli sandwiches, not to mention their specials. My only real gripe with Arthur's is that their wine and beer menus leave much to be desired. The wine list is (barely) passable, but like everything else, extremely well priced.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Dont complain about the interiors of this place as long as you're happy with the 23 dollar 24 ounces steak.",Arthurs,3.5 star rating,$$,"Steakhouses,, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"
