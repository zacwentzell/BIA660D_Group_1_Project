1,JS2g9XhV307zV1UhaGh2tQ,Marc I.,4.0 star rating,"Moved to Jersey City in late 2002.  This is the first place I went out for a beer then and it was a ""pretty good"" place.  Fast forward 16 years and I'm there with a buddy for a lunch and beer and a means to end the result of a prior night's bender.He knows Ed and Mary well while I don't, so I was a bit confused to say the least as it was last known as ""9th and Coles"" and that's exactly where the place is located.  But now Ed and Mary own it and for that they get the right to call it whatever they want.Mary was behind the bar and was just the nicest person to order from and interact with (on a limited basis).  Ed was not around, but I was put onto the bacon he has down in the basement and it's thick cut, and slightly sweet and man, oh man it's good!  Good to have a buddy in the know.The crowd was modest for the time we were there but involved 2 different couples having pleasant conversations at the bar and a circle of a woman's book club members doing nothing involved with books there.  In the back, a few steps down is a slightly-more family focused area with tables and it's set back enough to to let you bring young kids.  Bathrooms are off of that section too, so I guess that makes sense as a family area.Can't say much for the menu since I literally had beer from a tap and bacon from a basement and did not even see a menu.But as much as you might want to know how the food is, I suggest trying it out as the staff is nice, friendly clientele, and now you know Ed's got the bacon!",Ed & Mary’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

They have $5 mimosas for brunch, pair that with an artisanal grilled cheese and you can't go wrong The bar area is small, but they have larger tables and benches in the back that can fit more than 6 if you are eating. They also have a large outdoor area that opens in the spring.It's on a quiet street, so when stumbling upon it, seems like a treasure of a local dive.

I came in on a balmy Saturday night and grabbed a seat at the bar for dinner. The menu has your pub staples (wings, fried stuff, burgers) with modern touches (a fine selection of grilled cheese sandwiches). Their fish and chips plate isn't to be missed: crisp whitefish fresh from the fryer with malt vinegar and a homemade tartar sauce, paired well with a bottle of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot (not many neighborhood pubs offer up a fine barleywine).The vibe and the prices make Ed and Mary's worth repeat visits",Ed & Mary’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

6,I-cIvsDlNlV1dk3pWCT69w,Esther J.,4.0 star rating,"Had great reviews so wanted to check out this place. Maybe it was because it was a weekend night. There was one waitress and one waiter serving the entire full restaurant and bar which was incredible. Unfortunately the wait time to get a menu was long, about 15-20 min. But they seemed to be doing well for a ""two man show."" We finally got to order and the food hit the spot. We got grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and Blue Moon beer. Unfortunately I fell asleep before the waiter was able to get our check after we finished. I was also very tired. I'd definitely try it again. Very charming, cozy feel with excellent, upscale, creative ""diner"" food. They seemed to have a bunch of locals; it's a good sign.",Ed & Mary’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

8,8Gr6Pm3eztyKZiqi1LWncA,John V.,5.0 star rating,"Ed & Mary's is one of my local jaunts which has seen several different owners during my 14 year tenure in Jersey City.Since assuming control of this bar/restaurant, Ed and Mary have been singularly focused on making this the neighborhood ""go to"" place for great service, drinks and food. Towards that goal, they are succeeding, and I wish them great success!Today, I had perhaps one of the best breakfast meals in my 57 years on this planet.  More specifically, I ordered the Chicken and Funnel Cakes. My order arrived hot, perfectly cooked accompanied by home-made bacon, butter and warm syrup for my Funnel Cakes. In short, the combination of butter melting and melding with the warm syrup on the hot Funnel Cakes was the closest thing to sex that you can have for breakfast. In fact, the only thing that could have made this breakfast better was binge watching a Netflix episode for the rest of the day with the super cute girl from Hoboken to the right of me who is cheering on the Eagles in her Carson Wentz Jersey. It was that good!The Fried Chicken serving size was substantial, perfectly cooked and was the underpinning of an overall great meal.  The home-made bacon was amazing! In short, if you love bacon, this side dish can only be experienced as words will not suffice, unless I revert back to the girl from Hoboken and she is now wearing a thong and your favorite T-Shirt.Absolutely Fabulous, just like the Solid Gold Dancer that the Hoboken girl is hanging out with!",Ed & Mary’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
