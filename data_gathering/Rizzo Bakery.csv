3,nkiWjx4BGsJ12eBbfhfxbg,Mariam B.,5.0 star rating,"Hands down the best pizza in Jersey City. I've tried several pizzerias in the area, but no one gets it right like Rizzo's. I really do believe that because they are also an Italian bakery their pizza has such a unique taste to it. First of all, you can tell from the crust that the dough has been prepared well- when you bite into it you taste a very nice doughy/matured yeast flavor that I've never tasted before. Their crust is not soggy and over dripping with grease so the slice holds itself well. Whatever it is that they are doing, I recommend that they continue doing it!",Rizzo Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Italian"

13,gh2taUJ2I-r2VQXzUujdjQ,Taras F.,4.0 star rating,"I'll start off by saying I'm from the Midwest, our pizzas have a minimum total thickness of one inch, anything less is considered thin crust. Buying pizza in this area is a completely different experience. That being said though, I had the margherita pizza here and although much thinner than I am used to it tasted phenomenal. The sauce was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness, the cheese tasted very fresh and the fresh basil added the perfect kick of flavor you expect from a margherita. I do have to dock them a star for the setup inside. It's a bit all over the place. There's two counters and no signs as to where you should place orders, which I guess for locals might not be a problem but again, I'm not from around here. Also some sort of board with prices and menu items would be nice to have in there. The food needs no improvement, it is wonderful just how it is but setup could be improved.

40,Z-DfcNfZA3zXFI6KCAcWhw,Nisreen G.,4.0 star rating,"This was a pretty cute bakery in Jersey City that felt a bit reminiscent of my normal north end haunts. Immediately upon entering the wooden paneled joint your eyes are drawn to the large pastry cases at the front of the store. Unfortunately, when I visited the cases were pretty empty but I'm not positive if that was because it was post holiday rush or if that's there norm. Ordered two mini cannolis( no regular sizes in sight) but luckily they fill the shells upon demand. Yay fresh ricotta. Pretty standard cannoli--I wasn't overly impressed but sweet ricotta that's just a touch under smooth is a weakness so snack on them I did. The man tried the thumbprint cookies and was happy, so maybe cookies are more there thing. Directly opposite the dessert cases is a couple shelves stocked with Italian grocery items and some normal grocery fare. Pasta, sauces, jams, flour, and bagged sweets. What really had me about this place was the pizza counter in the back. Making huge pies with single slices for sale at just under 2.50, this was the real star of Rizzos. Me and the man grabbed a gigantic slice each of the cheese and instantly released a sigh of happiness upon first bite. Thin light crust, sweet and tangy sauce, wonderful glorious cheese, and minimal oil. Just absolutely hit the spot. They sell whole pies with a variety of toppings and has some seating in the back. Definitely would happily go back for a slice or two next time I'm in jersey! And maybe by then the dessert cases will be filled.",Rizzo Bakery,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Italian"

52,w3czn31CGNmzHFtsWxmuVg,Denise C.,4.0 star rating,"Heard about this place from one of my students and decided to give it a try. I walked out the door with one of the largest slices of pizza I've ever had, for just $2. The slice was a quintessential area slice - foldable (though it was like folding a road map due to size), with just the right balance of cheese and slightly sweet sauce. Having been back since that wonderful day, I've tried some of their other menu and bakery items. They make a solid cheesesteak, which I surprisingly liked much better than the eggplant parm hero. All their breads are carbtastic. Lemon ricotta cookies are outstanding and I may or may not have destroyed an entire container in one day.On any given day, you will find a mix of students, cops, firemen, and other born-and-raised JC people.

Yesterday, I finally had the chance to try it. WOW. I managed to have 2 of the ginormous slices (yes 2!) and they were really, REALLY good.I am a pizza snob, so if my pizza doesn't make the crunch sound within the first bite, it fails. This pizza stayed crunchy the entire time, and that made me very happy. The pizza wasn't droopy or oily or soft - it was just right :) SO much better than Benny Tudino's!My boyfriend gave me some insight into the history of Rizzo's and I am impressed with the place.

I had driven by the bakery quite a few times but never popped in. As the other reviewers stated, it is a small, family run bakery. They have tables for dining in. Both Grandma and daughter were both very nice. This is the type of business I love to support. Rizzo Bakery has an assortment of Italian cookies, cannolli, biscotti and Italian bread BUT it is also a deli and pizzeria. The have a small selection, somewhat limited, of hot foods on display and they make cold cut sandwiches too. I had a broccoli rabe and fresh mutz sandwich on delicious, fresh Italian bread......awesome! My next trip there I will try out the pizza.

You can taste the love and the realness in this food. The bakery makes the best cookies. The ones I like are the the small chocolate squares with the red/yellow/green colored filing. I call them Italian Rasta cookies. Bomb as hell!
