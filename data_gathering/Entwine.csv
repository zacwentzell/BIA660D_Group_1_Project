When you come across it, you think maybe you're stumbling upon a charming little hole-in-the-wall bar, but it's really just another overpriced, pretentious West Village bar. The inside is cute, with close-together seating -- the bar is on the main floor and seating is upstairs and downstairs. When I went, the service was pretty bad. First, they seated us right next to another party when there was empty seating elsewhere, which OK but... right after we got our second drinks, they told us we had to move downstairs (2 flights) because the table was promised to someone else. They did not clarify whether it was a reservation or just a party that seemed preferable to ours -- I have a feeling they could SMELL the nonprofit on my coworkers and me! ;)   If nothing else, it's evidence of poor organization on their part and/or terrible customer service to (a) kick customers out of table when they're trying to enjoy a night out drinking $14 glasses of wine, and (b) not telling the customers when they sat down that this table was reserved within the hour and offering the option of STARTING downstairs.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

They were bland and watered down, and at that price that just doesn't fly. On to the food, the sliders were actually pretty good (the meat they used seemed high quality but at $16 I wouldn't expect anything less). The grilled cheese, however, wasn't even grilled and they used sliced deli cheese for it (you could still see that they were slices, as they hadn't even melted) and the arugula side salad was literally just plain arugula with a tiny bit of dressing. It really felt like a 12 year old made it.The whole thing was $60 for two entrees and two drinks, and while the service was pretty good (the waiter was warm and solicitous), everything else was disappointing.

Upon entering, the host advise that my party was downstairs. First impression, this is a super small place. The downstairs had one small bar which minimal had seatings. I can't imagine having more than one party there. The place itself is cute and I understand the aesthetic but there's really nothing appealing to me. My friend and I went to the bar to order drinks. I ordered a Jameson and ginger. I know pretty basic. The bartender looked at his selection and advised they ""might"" have it upstairs but he doesn't have it here. Fine. I opted for the makers mark instead. That drink was steep costing me $16 not including tip. Not to mention, it was a cash bar only. I don't mind paying that much for drinks but this was not some swanky pretentious rooftop hotel in the Meatpacking. This was a tiny charming place in the west village. Who carries that much cash around for a place like that?! Anyway, my guy friend brought a round of Jameson shots to the table. Hmm... So all of a sudden you do have Jameson?! I'm a stickler for customer service and i don't know if he was lazy to go upstairs for me or maybe I just ordered 1 drink and he didn't feel the need to go upstairs for just my drink but I wasn't happy. I had to compromise what I really wanted and had paid that price. There's way too many places in the city to have drinks then to come back here for drinks.

69,Hvv-IEK5iCwbisYlUZ043A,Jake U.,2.0 star rating,"This trendy little restaurant in meatpacking could have been great but everything really fell short when I went this past Saturday night. A group of friends and I made a reservation for 8 people that they gladly took. Once we showed up to sit down though the host had told us that they were having a private party in their downstairs space and that we would have to move an hour into the meal. I'm not sure what kind of restaurant would think people are ok with their server coming to the table in the middle of the meal and making the entire party move to another spot. If I wanted to do that I wouldn't have chosen this mediocre restaurant in the first place. After arguing with the host for 10 minutes and threatening to leave they magically found a spot for us in the back room.Once we sat down things seemed to be going fine. The server we had was very nice and the drinks were quite good. If I didn't enjoy the drinks this would be a 1 star review. Atmosphere is bland. If you like sitting in a dimly lit room with boring music this is the place for you!The menu isn't very extensive. Mostly small plates with a couple main dishes. We ordered a cheese board to start which was fair. I ordered their chicken sandwich. The food looked pretty good when it came out but once I bit into my sandwich I was extremely disappointed. To call it a chicken sandwich is fraudulent and that's being nice. I think there was maybe one chicken wing worth of chicken on that sandwich. It really felt like I was just eating a bad grilled cheese on a brioche bun or something.Before I forget, the place totally forgot to make my friends order of the chicken thighs. Everyone else at the table had finished eating. When we asked to cancel it she assured it would be right out. Of course it would... We agreed to wait a bit longer but told her she must take it off the bill. She reluctantly complied with our request.I really wish that my group and I just left to find another place to eat.

We were asked whether we wanted to be seated indoors or in the outdoor patio. Obviously, we choose the latter because that's what you do in NYC in the summer.Between the four of us, we split a carafe of tropical rum punch, which was very delicious combined with a powerful dose of rum. It was a bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it if you're looking for high quality atmosphere and drinks.About the atmosphere: the outdoor patio is so cute. The white brick walls, wall décor, strung ""Christmas"" lights, patio seats and tables. It was too perfect. The best part is that we managed to stay cool in the heat of the July afternoon. I would come here just for the patio.Anyway, a few days later I made a trek back to Entwine. I sat in the patio again and ordered a glass of sangria this time. Surprisingly, the owner recognized me from last time so I didn't have to show my ID again. And that's the moment I knew that Entwine was a very special place.Good vibes through and through.

After looking far and wide on Yelp for a suitable first date bar with a patio, I found this little gem in the West Village. It's deceptively small from the storefront -- just keep going back. There's a front space by the bar, a backroom, and then a small outdoor garden. Who cares if the tree outside kept raining little pieces of foliage down on me? The rosé was crisp, the servers were just the right amount of attentive, and the place wasn't at all crowded on a Sunday night.

It took forever, and then they ended up loudly asking whose it was, and even when we said us, the plate somehow ended up with another group, who then confusedly handed it to us.

There's a busier front bar and a more quaint and quiet seating area in the back. The drinks are on the more expensive side, but if you get there before 7pm, you have a good choice of wines at half the price.It's got a different vibe than most other places I've gone to. It's somewhat ""gentleman's room"" in that it's dark and has fake horns on the wall. But it's also subtle-ly chic and low key.

We ended up ordering from the regular menu because according to us, it was whiskey Wednesday! We ordered the Sazerac and the Scotland Yard, and we munched on the chicken liver pate and the walnut, tomato paste and red pepper spread. The pate was tasty with the baquette they provided (endless supply of bread for all you carb lovers) but the walnut, tomato paste and red pepper spread (such a mouthful) just tasted like tomato paste.

Nice atmosphere.Warning: Large service related rant below, read others' reviews and you'll see I'm not alone in finding their service majorly lacking.. Continue reading if you want to relive my entwine experience.I've been here a few times on weekdays, because it is in my neighborhood and the atmosphere is cute and cozy, with alot of room. The service has always been somewhat unfriendly and I'd even seen arguments between customers with hostile bartenders who didn't know how to make the drink they requested, instead of figuring out the ingredients or having a conversation about it, they'd argue with the poor person that just wanted a specific drink.  But I always put that aside because I received my drinks relatively quickly (probably due to the weekday factor).Fast forward to last night.I chose this place to meet up with friends because as I mentioned it is spacious, so I figured it would be easy to find a seat.I met my friend at the bar and joined her with my boyfriend. It took about 10min to even get acknowledgement from her and then another 10 to get my simple drink order of persecco and a gin and tonic + waters.  My friend had already ordered a drink (persecco) as she was waiting for us (I'll come back to that in a sec). We received our easy to ""make"" drinks about 10min later - never received the water btw.  My boyfriend never one to complain thought his G&T was flat and asked me to taste it (it was and virtually undrinkable). He was going to just try to force it down..I nicely told the bartender that I thought the G&T was flat - she blankly looked at me with at ""so?"" expression on her face, so I asked if she could remake the drink. My boyfriend asked if it came from the line (as opposed to a bottle) and she said yes, but she said ""don't worry I'll make it right"" (wahoo! --maybe I was wrong about her?), but then she proceeded to pour a small bit into a glass to prove it had ""some"" fizz and gestured ""see?!"" and offered to do nothing about his drink. Then her friends at the bar proceeded to mock my boyfriend saying their drinks were fine and to chill out.  He was thinking, am I crazy, so he said - you can try mine to see what I'm talking about - and she said ""Eww I would never!"" and slammed his glass back down on the bar and offered to do nothing for him.From that point we decided to go elsewhere since there are so many bars to choose from and asked to settle up (another 10min til we go the check)When the bill came it was for 2 perseccos.  My friend said, ""what? I already paid for mine - I put a 20 down on the bar and now it is gone."" The bartender flat out denied that she ever saw a $20 bill and made no efforts of even being apologetic or knocking the bill down, so I paid again. Mind you that there was no one sitting on either side of my friend when we got there (or even 15min prior to) and we were all quite sober - 1st drink of the evening (and my friend had just gone to the ATM so she knew how much money she had in her wallet) and was missing a $20.The $20 isn't the point, but how it was handled by this horrid bartender. I've been living in NYC for 10years now and yes of course you experience cold or brusk service, but I have never experienced contentious & unapologetic service.I hope this woman gets out of the service industry - I will not be back to Entwine ever again since there are way too many bars in the area to choose from that appreciate their customers.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

After which the drinks came out. We waited for the cheese platter a long time and it turned out the waiter forgot. Then when the cheese platter finally arrives it's literally 4 or 5 Petit pieces of cheese. For $25, really? I'm all for French portions and European portions having lived abroad, and it is not gauche nor vulgarity in me to say, bill gates, Oprah or her majesty wouldn't throw $25 bucks away for 5 pieces of cheese.

Cozy and comfortable is how I would describe this place. We grabbed the small settee in the back and caught up on our girl talk. I barely made the happy hour which is 4-7. I would recommend the wine for happy hour, you get a little more bang for your buck with the glass and a small carafe of the overfill. The decor is a little mish-moshy old rustic victorian meets farmhouse. I love the wallpaper in the women's bathroom, I worked in the intimate apparel industry for awhile so I got a big kick out of it. After the 7 the place was abuzz and every seat was filled. We ordered some tasty items from the menu: hummus, grilled cheese and bbq quesadilla all very delicious the quesadilla being the most delicious.

He explained to us that he created the rocking cocktail menu and offered hints. I chose wine, only because I'd been craving a nice dry red all afternoon, and I wasn't disappointed. Next time, however, I'd certainly give the cocktails a go. There was a whiskey drink with ginger, basil, and lemon that sounded mmmm... We ordered 3 cheeses, and I don't quite know what to say about them... it was hard to rate them... the portions were very, very little (L and I channeled our inner Oliver Twists)... and they just weren't anything grand. The olives, however, were nice, and I liked the dried figs and honey served with the cheese.

I'm half-way tempted to post a picture of it. It's priceless.Finally, Entwine seems to be fairly scene-less in a very sceney part of the city. Situated just around the corner from places over-flowing with high-heels, Prada, and fancy-cars, Entwine unpretentiously throws its doors open for those of us that just want to have a nice night out.All in all, I am making this a new ""go-to"" place for when I'm looking for an easy, casual, and nice place to spend an evening.

187,S5A0RIfzsbBhqCuh4zrsUg,Michael B.,4.0 star rating,"What do I love about this place? Open at 4:00, while most places open later, just dinner hours, which makes no sense. Layout: lively bar in front, further back a lounge with comfy chairs, and finally a patio, with NO MUSIC, great for conversation in good weather. The wine list is solid, and the happy hour specials are a true bargain. There's small plate food after 5:00. This is my favorite in an area that is not ""out of the way"" any more and that has all of a sudden a good number of wine bars. Staff are welcoming, unpretentious, there when you need them.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

We'll start with 3 Stars. Middle of the road.I would add a star but I won't cuz it's not fair, because my friend works there (my disclaimer)+1 Star... good wine list, fairly priced with plenty of by the glass choices-1 Star... they closed the kitchen due to a party before I could get to try some of their Turkish small plates ... at 10pm. Boo.+1 Star... roomy bathroom for those that like to relieve in peace-1 Star... schizophrenic decor. It's a log cabin. With mirrors, And rope. And a weird snake stuffed animal in the banister. +1 Star... Outdoor space. Outdoor space for a bar/resto is like closet space in an apartment: PRICELESS.-1 Star... Concept. ""What's the Entwined mean?"" my friend said. I shrug, ""I dunno? The snake in the banister? Something with uh.... er... Twine... that's uh er.. Turkish... that+1 Star... Service. My friend didn't wait on us most of the night, so completely unbiased, the service was super friendly.-1 Star... For the jerk that lived in the neighborhood spouting off his beliefs that no one should ever go to Mexico or above 14th Street. Couldn't remember the bartender's name after being told 50 times. Sorry... if this ends up being the crowd... So 3 Stars. I know. My mind is a scary place.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
189,xLV8Ijxi1MQAcmlej7XaOw,Steff L.,5.0 star rating,This is my favorite little neighborhood bar.  They have a fantastic wine list and a great selection of cheese and apps.  I adore the fantastically chill vibe and cute (but super tiny) garden outside.  This is a great spot for a romantic drink or some wine and cheese for happy hour with friends.  Much love for Entwine!,Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

191,ASO74AVC-8jNgRPbZSO5OA,TM d.,4.0 star rating,"Entwine is a great place, but like all of the small wine bars in the West Village, your timing will give you much different experiences.  After work and early evenings on the weekends is one of the best times to go, especially on Sunday before dinner and on Monday nights - both of which they offer 1/2 price bottles.  There will be maybe one or two other groups there, a seat for you and the opportunity to see their decor and ambiance at its best.  It's a great place to meet someone for a great conversation, if you are in a business where small personal contacts matter, it's perfect.  If you are dating someone and beyond basic introductions, it's great.  In the front of the house is a laid back bar one can just linger by themselves as well.In terms of their menu, their wines are solid and their cheese plate is an automatic order for me.  It's worth exploring their food items a bit, but know that their menu is geared to noshing lightly while clutching your wine glass and enjoying the company of those you are with.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

I was a skeptical, to be quite honest. I have a place that I LOVE for Ceviche, but I was not disappointed. All I can say is that you may not want to come here if you are starving. I think I could have had about 2 orders by myself, but I do like to eat! The selection of wine, did it for me! The staff really made some great recommendations for pairings and their is such a range of wines you will not get bored. I have not gone yet, but it is on my calendar to go to their tastings that are offered Wed and Thurs evening from 7-9 and it is only $25 bucks!

193,VpFumlx9PaXbe4nQFLARPQ,robyn b.,4.0 star rating,"After reading some of these reviews I was worried....Arrived at Entwine and was greeted by the bartender right away and was able to get a seat in the cozy backroom, waiter/bartender came right over and told me happy hour was until 7:00pm.  He mentioned 1 red, 1 white  for $6 and some beers were on special (don't remember price, probably $5).  The white wine was great for $6, my friend had the red.  The waiter/bartender came over about every 20 minutes to see if we needed anything.  The bar can not be seen from the cute table area so if he hadn't been around I would have had no problem getting up to order something.  This didn't happen, but I could understand if the bar got busy how it would be hard for the bartender to do it all.The atmosphere is wonderful, dimly lit, small tables for 2, even a couch with a table in the back room, good music playing in the background at the perfect volume.  The food was good, had 2 cheeses for $12 which was an excellent deal, good size cheese, small bread, a few grapes (a few more would have been nice).  Also got the hummus with grilled pita, very good, waiter even asked if we wanted more pita when we had finished it all and still had hummus left.I say give this place another chance, I know I will be back especially during happy hour, what a great deal, great atmosphere and great attentive friendly bartender/waiter.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

195,KH0I4eBejRsXSq72UVc-3w,Jessica B.,5.0 star rating,"I'm almost hesitant to write a review because Entwine is one of the best kept secrets in the Village/Chelsea area. Authentic, good drinks and company - the perfect place to go on a date or catch up with friends without feeling cramped or hurried. I was so excited to hear of the video screenings on Sundays. The fact that they feature artists well-known in other countries but not yet in the US shows that there is a real need for venues to take in video art. Even the screenings are laid-back, cozy and feeling like a get-together among friends, instead of a sterile white cube environment. Entwine really is one of a few remaining bars where you don't have to shout to be heard, where the focus isn't some inane theme but just good drinks, food, and people. You can tell that someone put a lot of love into this place - the unique wallpaper in the bathroom, the details in the choice of furniture and decoration - the hand selected cold cuts and olives... Just go there (I'll be on the terrace :)",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

The last time I went they had a video art event on the lower level, which i believe they now do every tuesday. I usually hate bar food but they have a great selection fine cold cuts etc - a true european dinner - to accompany their light and delicious cocktails. and they also have an outdoor terrace which is great because the only outdoor seating nyc has is on the sidewalk. 5 STARS.",Entwine,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Cocktail, Bars,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
