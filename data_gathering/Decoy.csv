A duck's quack, contrary to popular belief, does in fact echo.3. Ducks, are omnivores, probably like you, so your time here will probably suck if you're veagan.4. The most commonly farmed duck, and the one you're most likely going to eat here is the Pekin duck (also called the Long Island duck). This is confusing as fk because Pekin (Beijing) and Long Island are really far from each other. But it's probably these duckboys can fly anywhere they damn please.Finally, ducks are fking delicious and especially the duck here. Go with a party of 5 and order 2 whole ducks as entree. Avoid everything else on the menu that's non-duck related because it sucks (e.g. steamed sea bass).

I was not disappointed.The drink menu is fantastic. Look in the top right corner for their specials. I ordered a cocktail that, among other delicious things, boasted egg white and duck fat! It was as rich and delicious as I hoped with a little extra tang.If you go with a large party, the appetizers are dropped on your table like hail. Oh and there is only one table. So expect to make friends. The standouts were the incredibly rich and pleasantly spicy crab fried rice, the scalding crab and pork soup dumplings, and the crunchy shishito peppers stuffed with shrimp. Woah. And the duck was, unsurprisingly, incredible.The service was perfect.

3,488M_ubE3Dv8YKRL7XRo1w,Jocelyn K.,4.0 star rating,"After hearing bad reviews on Da Dong, my friend canceled his reservation and we decided to go to Decoy instead. The restaurant is incredibly tiny. It consists of one long table, the bar, and two tiny tables on either side of the door. If you have the misfortune of sitting near the entrance during the winter, make sure you wear a sweater. We did the $75 prix fixe for 5 people, which came with one plate of duck, 10 pancakes, sauces, Asian pickles, decoy chips, duck consommé, 4 sides, 3 entrees, 1 fried rice, and 1 vegetable side. Peking Duck - The duck tasted like the peking duck I've had at most Cantonese restaurants. The pancakes are really small and flimsy. They give us 10 and charge $6 for extra. They took away the extra before we finished even though they charged us for it. They put the duck on a smaller plate to make room for the other dishes, but didn't give us back the sauces and the pancakes. The three sauce that came with the duck were hoisin, cranberry (weird), and sesame (tastes like a tang yuan). The duck consommé was delicious and probably my favorite part. Overall, the duck was tasty, but I think I'd rather go to a Cantonese restaurant and get larger pieces of duck and pancake wraps there.Decoy Chips and Asian pickles - I loved the Decoy Chips!!! They turned out to be fried fish skin. The pickles were great as well. I loved the mango one the best. For those with shrimp allergies, the pickled cucumbers and cauliflower has shrimp in it.Oxtail dumplings - This was my favorite out of the four sides. The filling had an interesting briny taste to it. The dumplings also have shrimp in it for those who have shrimp allergies.Katz's Pastrami Triangles - Not my favorite. Crunchy vegetable and peanut dumplings - I thought these would be boring but I actually enjoyed these dumplings. It tasted like they used jicama in the filling.Grilled Wagyu beef pieces - I only had a small bite, since it was rather far away from me on the table. It was okay, not mind-blowing or anything, but that may be because my piece was too small. The beef also has shrimp in it. Chilean sea bass - This came as small pieces of bass with on a bed of vegetables. The flavor of the sauce was on the sweet side. Not my favorite sea bass dish, but it wasn't bad.Sauteed Diced Lamb on Roti - I enjoyed the flavor of the lamb which came as small pieces in a bowl made out of roti. The lamb wasn't too chewy.Grilled Pork ""Toro"" with Korean rice cakes - The pork and rice cakes were cut into little strips. I didn't get much of this since it was on the other side of the table.Truffle egg fried rice - Really delicious. The rice is covered in a fluffy and soft truffle-flavored omelette. The fried rice underneath was average as in not as good as a Chinese restaurant, but wow that egg was so good. This was better than all the entrees we ordered.Sauteed snow pea shoots - Way overpriced. I think a Cantonese restaurant can make this better for $6 less and twice the size. In terms of Peking Duck, I wouldn't say they are that much better than the Peking Duck you get at Cantonese restaurants. They are immensely better than DaDong though and I do think their entrees and sides make the prix fixe worth it.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"
4,8RVj_p50k6gwGsb7yG511g,Arthur C.,5.0 star rating,"Having dined recently at Dadong, I still had the sour taste of mediocre Peking duck in my mouth. Thankfully, my friend landed a reservation at Decoy and I am thrilled to report that it was not only better than Dadong (truly a low bar) but excellent in its own right.Peking duck is an excellent dish, one that too few people will ever get to try. There are numerous Chinese restaurants that roll out halfhearted takes on the dish for the imperceptive among us. Do not let yourself make that mistake; instead, indulge yourself and some friends at Decoy.Our party of four had the Peking duck dinner, comprised of the following:STARTERSHomemade Pickles: These sound very humble, but turn out to be six unique cups of light yet bright fruits and vegetables, including a lovely curry and fresh mango. Do not overlook these!Decoy Chips: Likewise not your boring old Lays; these are fried branzino skin cooked and seasoned to perfection to whet your appetite for the feast to come.SMALL PLATESOctopus Salad: The first small plate to come out, fittingly as it is served cold. The presentation was wonderful, a small plate of octopus and cucumber perched atop a white porcelain teapot filled with dry ice sublimating cool carbon dioxide out the spout. The flavors matched the display.Shrimp Stuffed Shishito Peppers: Well prepared, a half step above the kind you would find at many dim sum spots.Oxtail Dumplings: Everyone knows anything oxtail is yummy, and these are no exception. Tender and bursting with meat juice.MAIN DISHESSauteed Diced Lamb: Succulent and saucy, paired appropriately with Chinese broccoli and pickled shallots (grossly underutilized in cuisine). The lamb is actually served on top of a crepe-like pancake, in case you need to carbo-load for that marathon you are not running.Steamed Sea Bass: Good but not great, perhaps because we were nearing fullness as the meal came to a close. Probably the simplest dish on the night.RICETruffle Egg Fried Rice: A pleasant surprise, with a thin layer of cooked egg encasing the aromatic rice within like an omurice. I am not 100% sold on the marriage of truffle oil with rice yet, but this is a solid rendition.DUCKDuck Consomme Shots: How are more restaurants not catching on to consomme shots already? Everyone knows consomme is a fancy word for clarified liquid fat, but because it's French it must taste good. This one really does, and warms the soul before the sin that is about to unfold with the...Peking Duck: Serving hands down the best Peking duck - if not the best bird - I have had stateside, Decoy toes the line between crispiness and tenderness brilliantly. The pancakes are, importantly, the perfect texture and temperature as well. In addition to the typical cucumber and spring onions is an option of crispy shallots to accompany the duck slices into your pancake, which are an excellent innovation. Both the hoisin and sesame work well albeit separately and not in the same bite. The only slight hiccup is the baffling inclusion of a cranberry sauce alongside the traditional hoisin and a housemade sesame.Service was brisk but attentive, and although most parties greater than two will likely find themselves at the long communal table, you never feel claustrophobic. Rather, it makes for some entertaining people-watching or possibly even some friendly conversation (the horror!) with the adjacent group.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Decoy was HIGHLY recommended by the doctor that I work with who lives in the city..so I knew he knew all the good places to eat. My husband and I came here before Valentine's Day for an early celebration and I'm SO glad we did. We had reservations for 8:30pm and got here around 8:15pm and the place was already packed. VERY small place, it's on the bottom floor of their sister restaurant Red Farm. There's a long farm style table on the left that can fit around 20 (?) people and the bar to the right that can fit around 10ish. At the bar, an a la carte menu is available whereas at the table, it's a pre fixe menu. The pre fixe menu was $75pp with a choice of 2 appetizers and a main rice dish OR a side dish. Along with that came the Peking duck, branzino chips, pickled cucumbers, kimchi cauliflower, and mango. For the appetizers, we opted for the Waygu beef and vegetable and peanut dumplings. For our main course, we chose the crab and scallops rice dish. This was MORE than enough food for two people with leftovers to bring home for a full dinner! The entire staff was beyond amazing. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a young woman who was extremely friendly and wasn't even fazed by how busy it was. We were then seated and greeted immediately by our waiter who got us water within the first 5 minutes of us sitting down. As soon as he came back with our waters, he asked if this was our first time and explained the menu to us. After ordering, our food came out during the perfect timing. Empty dishes were taken away immediately and tables and plates were cleaned before our duck came out. All I'm trying to say, is that the service at this place is beyond awesome!The FOOD was f-in PHENOMENAL. Its really had to cook duck to begin with, but to cook it like how they do overseas, is amazing. Born and raised in Hong Kong, it's hard to find food that actually tastes like home- and I have to tell you, this tasted like home. I'd like to give my compliments to the chef(s) for making everything to perfection. The duck shooter that it comes with, is basically duck broth...let's just say everything you eat here is orgasmically good!The duck LITERALLY melts in your mouth with the crunchiness of the duck skin. Three sauces that came with the duck was a peanut sauce, cranberry, and a hoisin sauce (sweet brown sauce). I don't think I have any words to describe the duck without saying this is something you have to sit and try yourself! If you're not a duck fan, I suggest you try Decoy's duck...I can guarantee you'll be a duck fan after having tried their duck I will highly recommend this to friends and family and will for sure come back!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

From the outside, the neon lights threw me off and I walked right by thinking it was a sports bar (idk why). Inside, the restaurant is cozy and comfortable.We made a reservation for 7:30 and were seated pretty quickly. We dined for about 2 hours and never felt rushed. Also, I have a shrimp allergy (sad, I know) and the staff was meticulous about letting us know what may contain shrimp. Spoiler alert: a lot of dishes contain shrimp or a shrimp sauce.The food was good. The menu was overwhelming before the waitress explained how it worked but still it could have been more straight forward. Something I'm still unclear about is the portion of duck and wraps you get (10 wraps to start, $6 for each additional 10.) Between the 5 of us we each had 4 wraps. Are the number of wraps you get based on # of people or is it a set amount? This would make a huge difference in whether I would go back as a party of 2 or more.Overall, service was great and food was good.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

You really can't go wrong here, but probably isn't a great option for a vegetarian. (Note that I have no idea if there is a different menu.)We were a large group (9) with a reservation, and were seated at RedFarm upstairs, which was lovely. Most of the staff were really friendly. It was an interesting arrangement, as we didn't have an assigned waitress/waiter - we could flag down anyone if we needed something like a spoon.

11,fhSx4btDzJRmkoy4xk0Ngg,BJ F.,5.0 star rating,"Booked a reservation to this place based on it being rated as the #1 spot for Best Places for Peking Duck based on a Grub Street review in 2016.  They started us off with Fried Fish Skins with some type of tomato based dipping sauce, Duck confit, and several types of pickled sauces consisting of Kimchee cucumber, Kimchee cauliflower, curry butternut squash, and some type of mango sauce.  The sides were were delicious and the duck confit was heavenly!The prix fixe meal cost $85/person and since there were 3 of us, we were allowed to order one main dish, , 3 side dishes, one rice dish, and one vegetable dish.As our main dish we chose the Grilled Pork 'Toro' with Korean Rice Cakes.  Each bite was flavorful and refreshing.We chose the Octopus Salad with Pickled Cucumber, Foie Gras & Strawberry Tarts, and Oxtail Dumplings.  The Octopus Salad dish was amazing and I wish we could have had more.  The Foie Gras & Strawberry Tart was a combination of 2 foods I would have never imagined eating together but it was just mind-blowing!  The Oxtail Dumplings were good but not as impressive as the first two.The Truffle Egg Fried Rice was just phenomenal.  The egg sitting atop the rice was fluffy yet rich.  The truffles were an added touch!We chose the Chinese Broccoli with Superior Shiitake 'Flower' Mushrooms as our vegetable dish.  Unfortunately, this was the least impressive of all the dishes.  Maybe it's because I'm all about the meat.  Who knows?Which brings us to the star of the show, the Peking Duck!  OMG!  I've had Peking Duck in so many different parts of the country and this place has them all beat!  The duck was sinfully delightful.  The homemade crepes were perfectly thin enough so as not to take away from the main flavor of the meat it envelops.  The skin was perfectly crisp and tasty like none other before!  At the end of the meal we were stuffed beyond belief and had several items to take home!The price may scare some people away but it was by far worth every penny for the ambiance, the culinary delights, and the memories that were made.  If you're thinking of dining here your best bet is to make reservations.  There is limited seating which consists of a long table which seats about 20 people (I think) and you are seated among everyone at that table.  There are side chairs at the bar and 2 other small 2 person tables but they only serve so many ducks each evening (the website states 25).  You can take a chance and just walk in but you may not be eating duck if they've already run out.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Amuse bouche quartet- pickled cauliflower, spicy cucumbers, potato/radish massaman curry, and a chili mango (I think). Of the 4, I think the curry was the best, while the mango was probably the pedestrian of them. Branzino fish skin chips with salsa- perfectly crispy with a thin batter. Salsa provides the right amount of sweetness and kick to complement and brighten the overall flavor. Even if you just dip into the liquid and don't scoop up any of the veggies, it just works.Sweet potato noodle salad with uni- Beautifully presented inside the shell of a sea urchin, this dish was a dish all about balance- yet it made you want more and more of it. The noodles had a firm chewy and almost crunchy texture, which was in contrast to the smooth creamy texture of the uni. Neither of the flavors of these two components were overpowering at all. But they meshed well together. Moreover, by the time you finish the noodles/uni, you get to the salad portion on the bottom which is in some kind of ponzu-like sauce that gives the whole experience of the dish the perfect finish. Duck Consomme- as a teaser before the duck, we had a small glass of this. OMG this is good. A broth with richness and a hint of gelatinous goodness that lingers on your tongue and lips with each sip. And yes, sip and savor this, don't chug it. Treat it like a fine scotch, and you'll enjoy it to the fullest. Peking Duck. I've had Peking duck from Paragon (Singapore), as well as from Da Dong (in Beijing)- This place does the duck justice- perhaps not with quite the finesse you'd find at Paragon (2 Michelin star spot), but definitely on par with Da Dong, and more flavorful at that. Seriously good stuff. This is destination-worthy. Crab and Scallop Fried rice: With lots of lump crab, small scallops (fresh, not dried out), and a healthy dose of spice that gives a low but enduring tingle on your palate (in a pleasant way), it definitely made an impression on me. Chinese broccoli and ""flower"" Shitake mushroom- I was surprised that they didn't use any of the leafy part of the broccoli, but only used the stems. This dish was good, but not a standout.16 oz aged NY steak- I love NY strips- they're my favorite cut of beef.  And these guys...absolutely killed it in the best sense of the word. I haven't had such a good NY strip in decades...so good. The sugar snap and snow peas that came along the side were a perfect complement to the beef. Cooked to firm/crispy yet tender texture.

The skin is perfectly crisp and seasoned (it almost tastes like candy -- meat candy), the meat wonderfully moist and succulent. The duck comes with pancakes, cucumbers, and green onions, and a selection of three sauces, only one of which is the authentic hoisin.The large-format dinner itself is fun, although a bit on the spendy side. When you make a reservation, you'll get a duck in addition to a number of snacks (appetizers), mains, and side dishes. You'll be able to choose each based on what's on the menu. The snacks come before the duck, which is then followed by your mains/rice/sides. Overall, it's sort of weird that the dinner doesn't finish with the duck -- it should be the piece de resistance of the meal! It's the best part, and everybody is just too stuffed for the remaining mains/rice/sides after the snacks/apps/duck.Service is nice, although a touch spotty -- they rushed us through ordering (and ordering can be confusing/overwhelming), but lagged towards the end of the meal. The space is a little cramped (aside from the bar, everybody sits at a long family-style table), but if you come with a party of 3 you can claim the heads of the table and get more space that way.We got:- Sitting Down for Dinner cocktail (super good, would recommend -- though the duck fat flavor is not evident at all)- Impeached cocktail (also good)- Old Man's Mountain (also good)- Decoy Chips (these are not chips, and more fried crispy fish skin -- SO GOOD)- Assorted Pickles- Sweet Potato Noodles with Uni (good, but probably wouldn't order again)- Oxtail Dumplings (good, but probably wouldn't order again)- Grilled Wagyu Beef Pieces (super good, would order again!)- Duck (duh)- Grilled Pork Toro with Rice Cakes (wasn't a fan -- the meat texture was off and rubbery)- Soft & Crunchy Vegetable Rice (good, but a little boring)- Asparagus with XO sauce (good, but a little boring)",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I was not disappointed.The drink menu is fantastic. Look in the top right corner for their specials. I ordered a cocktail that, among other delicious things, boasted egg white and duck fat! It was as rich and delicious as I hoped with a little extra tang.If you go with a large party, the appetizers are dropped on your table like hail. Oh and there is only one table. So expect to make friends. The standouts were the incredibly rich and pleasantly spicy crab fried rice, the scalding crab and pork soup dumplings, and the crunchy shishito peppers stuffed with shrimp. Woah. And the duck was, unsurprisingly, incredible.The service was perfect.

23,488M_ubE3Dv8YKRL7XRo1w,Jocelyn K.,4.0 star rating,"After hearing bad reviews on Da Dong, my friend canceled his reservation and we decided to go to Decoy instead. The restaurant is incredibly tiny. It consists of one long table, the bar, and two tiny tables on either side of the door. If you have the misfortune of sitting near the entrance during the winter, make sure you wear a sweater. We did the $75 prix fixe for 5 people, which came with one plate of duck, 10 pancakes, sauces, Asian pickles, decoy chips, duck consommé, 4 sides, 3 entrees, 1 fried rice, and 1 vegetable side. Peking Duck - The duck tasted like the peking duck I've had at most Cantonese restaurants. The pancakes are really small and flimsy. They give us 10 and charge $6 for extra. They took away the extra before we finished even though they charged us for it. They put the duck on a smaller plate to make room for the other dishes, but didn't give us back the sauces and the pancakes. The three sauce that came with the duck were hoisin, cranberry (weird), and sesame (tastes like a tang yuan). The duck consommé was delicious and probably my favorite part. Overall, the duck was tasty, but I think I'd rather go to a Cantonese restaurant and get larger pieces of duck and pancake wraps there.Decoy Chips and Asian pickles - I loved the Decoy Chips!!! They turned out to be fried fish skin. The pickles were great as well. I loved the mango one the best. For those with shrimp allergies, the pickled cucumbers and cauliflower has shrimp in it.Oxtail dumplings - This was my favorite out of the four sides. The filling had an interesting briny taste to it. The dumplings also have shrimp in it for those who have shrimp allergies.Katz's Pastrami Triangles - Not my favorite. Crunchy vegetable and peanut dumplings - I thought these would be boring but I actually enjoyed these dumplings. It tasted like they used jicama in the filling.Grilled Wagyu beef pieces - I only had a small bite, since it was rather far away from me on the table. It was okay, not mind-blowing or anything, but that may be because my piece was too small. The beef also has shrimp in it. Chilean sea bass - This came as small pieces of bass with on a bed of vegetables. The flavor of the sauce was on the sweet side. Not my favorite sea bass dish, but it wasn't bad.Sauteed Diced Lamb on Roti - I enjoyed the flavor of the lamb which came as small pieces in a bowl made out of roti. The lamb wasn't too chewy.Grilled Pork ""Toro"" with Korean rice cakes - The pork and rice cakes were cut into little strips. I didn't get much of this since it was on the other side of the table.Truffle egg fried rice - Really delicious. The rice is covered in a fluffy and soft truffle-flavored omelette. The fried rice underneath was average as in not as good as a Chinese restaurant, but wow that egg was so good. This was better than all the entrees we ordered.Sauteed snow pea shoots - Way overpriced. I think a Cantonese restaurant can make this better for $6 less and twice the size. In terms of Peking Duck, I wouldn't say they are that much better than the Peking Duck you get at Cantonese restaurants. They are immensely better than DaDong though and I do think their entrees and sides make the prix fixe worth it.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Thankfully, my friend landed a reservation at Decoy and I am thrilled to report that it was not only better than Dadong (truly a low bar) but excellent in its own right.Peking duck is an excellent dish, one that too few people will ever get to try. There are numerous Chinese restaurants that roll out halfhearted takes on the dish for the imperceptive among us. Do not let yourself make that mistake; instead, indulge yourself and some friends at Decoy.Our party of four had the Peking duck dinner, comprised of the following:STARTERSHomemade Pickles: These sound very humble, but turn out to be six unique cups of light yet bright fruits and vegetables, including a lovely curry and fresh mango. Do not overlook these!Decoy Chips: Likewise not your boring old Lays; these are fried branzino skin cooked and seasoned to perfection to whet your appetite for the feast to come.SMALL PLATESOctopus Salad: The first small plate to come out, fittingly as it is served cold. The presentation was wonderful, a small plate of octopus and cucumber perched atop a white porcelain teapot filled with dry ice sublimating cool carbon dioxide out the spout. The flavors matched the display.Shrimp Stuffed Shishito Peppers: Well prepared, a half step above the kind you would find at many dim sum spots.Oxtail Dumplings: Everyone knows anything oxtail is yummy, and these are no exception. Tender and bursting with meat juice.MAIN DISHESSauteed Diced Lamb: Succulent and saucy, paired appropriately with Chinese broccoli and pickled shallots (grossly underutilized in cuisine). The lamb is actually served on top of a crepe-like pancake, in case you need to carbo-load for that marathon you are not running.Steamed Sea Bass: Good but not great, perhaps because we were nearing fullness as the meal came to a close. Probably the simplest dish on the night.RICETruffle Egg Fried Rice: A pleasant surprise, with a thin layer of cooked egg encasing the aromatic rice within like an omurice. I am not 100% sold on the marriage of truffle oil with rice yet, but this is a solid rendition.DUCKDuck Consomme Shots: How are more restaurants not catching on to consomme shots already? Everyone knows consomme is a fancy word for clarified liquid fat, but because it's French it must taste good. This one really does, and warms the soul before the sin that is about to unfold with the...Peking Duck: Serving hands down the best Peking duck - if not the best bird - I have had stateside, Decoy toes the line between crispiness and tenderness brilliantly. The pancakes are, importantly, the perfect texture and temperature as well. In addition to the typical cucumber and spring onions is an option of crispy shallots to accompany the duck slices into your pancake, which are an excellent innovation. Both the hoisin and sesame work well albeit separately and not in the same bite. The only slight hiccup is the baffling inclusion of a cranberry sauce alongside the traditional hoisin and a housemade sesame.Service was brisk but attentive, and although most parties greater than two will likely find themselves at the long communal table, you never feel claustrophobic. Rather, it makes for some entertaining people-watching or possibly even some friendly conversation (the horror!) with the adjacent group.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Decoy was HIGHLY recommended by the doctor that I work with who lives in the city..so I knew he knew all the good places to eat. My husband and I came here before Valentine's Day for an early celebration and I'm SO glad we did. We had reservations for 8:30pm and got here around 8:15pm and the place was already packed. VERY small place, it's on the bottom floor of their sister restaurant Red Farm. There's a long farm style table on the left that can fit around 20 (?) people and the bar to the right that can fit around 10ish. At the bar, an a la carte menu is available whereas at the table, it's a pre fixe menu. The pre fixe menu was $75pp with a choice of 2 appetizers and a main rice dish OR a side dish. Along with that came the Peking duck, branzino chips, pickled cucumbers, kimchi cauliflower, and mango. For the appetizers, we opted for the Waygu beef and vegetable and peanut dumplings. For our main course, we chose the crab and scallops rice dish. This was MORE than enough food for two people with leftovers to bring home for a full dinner! The entire staff was beyond amazing. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a young woman who was extremely friendly and wasn't even fazed by how busy it was. We were then seated and greeted immediately by our waiter who got us water within the first 5 minutes of us sitting down. As soon as he came back with our waters, he asked if this was our first time and explained the menu to us. After ordering, our food came out during the perfect timing. Empty dishes were taken away immediately and tables and plates were cleaned before our duck came out. All I'm trying to say, is that the service at this place is beyond awesome!The FOOD was f-in PHENOMENAL. Its really had to cook duck to begin with, but to cook it like how they do overseas, is amazing. Born and raised in Hong Kong, it's hard to find food that actually tastes like home- and I have to tell you, this tasted like home. I'd like to give my compliments to the chef(s) for making everything to perfection. The duck shooter that it comes with, is basically duck broth...let's just say everything you eat here is orgasmically good!The duck LITERALLY melts in your mouth with the crunchiness of the duck skin. Three sauces that came with the duck was a peanut sauce, cranberry, and a hoisin sauce (sweet brown sauce). I don't think I have any words to describe the duck without saying this is something you have to sit and try yourself! If you're not a duck fan, I suggest you try Decoy's duck...I can guarantee you'll be a duck fan after having tried their duck I will highly recommend this to friends and family and will for sure come back!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

From the outside, the neon lights threw me off and I walked right by thinking it was a sports bar (idk why). Inside, the restaurant is cozy and comfortable.We made a reservation for 7:30 and were seated pretty quickly. We dined for about 2 hours and never felt rushed. Also, I have a shrimp allergy (sad, I know) and the staff was meticulous about letting us know what may contain shrimp. Spoiler alert: a lot of dishes contain shrimp or a shrimp sauce.The food was good. The menu was overwhelming before the waitress explained how it worked but still it could have been more straight forward. Something I'm still unclear about is the portion of duck and wraps you get (10 wraps to start, $6 for each additional 10.) Between the 5 of us we each had 4 wraps. Are the number of wraps you get based on # of people or is it a set amount?

Amuse bouche quartet- pickled cauliflower, spicy cucumbers, potato/radish massaman curry, and a chili mango (I think). Of the 4, I think the curry was the best, while the mango was probably the pedestrian of them. Branzino fish skin chips with salsa- perfectly crispy with a thin batter. Salsa provides the right amount of sweetness and kick to complement and brighten the overall flavor. Even if you just dip into the liquid and don't scoop up any of the veggies, it just works.Sweet potato noodle salad with uni- Beautifully presented inside the shell of a sea urchin, this dish was a dish all about balance- yet it made you want more and more of it. The noodles had a firm chewy and almost crunchy texture, which was in contrast to the smooth creamy texture of the uni. Neither of the flavors of these two components were overpowering at all. But they meshed well together. Moreover, by the time you finish the noodles/uni, you get to the salad portion on the bottom which is in some kind of ponzu-like sauce that gives the whole experience of the dish the perfect finish. Duck Consomme- as a teaser before the duck, we had a small glass of this. OMG this is good. A broth with richness and a hint of gelatinous goodness that lingers on your tongue and lips with each sip. And yes, sip and savor this, don't chug it. Treat it like a fine scotch, and you'll enjoy it to the fullest. Peking Duck. I've had Peking duck from Paragon (Singapore), as well as from Da Dong (in Beijing)- This place does the duck justice- perhaps not with quite the finesse you'd find at Paragon (2 Michelin star spot), but definitely on par with Da Dong, and more flavorful at that. Seriously good stuff. This is destination-worthy. Crab and Scallop Fried rice: With lots of lump crab, small scallops (fresh, not dried out), and a healthy dose of spice that gives a low but enduring tingle on your palate (in a pleasant way), it definitely made an impression on me. Chinese broccoli and ""flower"" Shitake mushroom- I was surprised that they didn't use any of the leafy part of the broccoli, but only used the stems. This dish was good, but not a standout.16 oz aged NY steak- I love NY strips- they're my favorite cut of beef.  And these guys...absolutely killed it in the best sense of the word. I haven't had such a good NY strip in decades...so good. The sugar snap and snow peas that came along the side were a perfect complement to the beef. Cooked to firm/crispy yet tender texture.

The skin is perfectly crisp and seasoned (it almost tastes like candy -- meat candy), the meat wonderfully moist and succulent. The duck comes with pancakes, cucumbers, and green onions, and a selection of three sauces, only one of which is the authentic hoisin.The large-format dinner itself is fun, although a bit on the spendy side. When you make a reservation, you'll get a duck in addition to a number of snacks (appetizers), mains, and side dishes. You'll be able to choose each based on what's on the menu. The snacks come before the duck, which is then followed by your mains/rice/sides. Overall, it's sort of weird that the dinner doesn't finish with the duck -- it should be the piece de resistance of the meal! It's the best part, and everybody is just too stuffed for the remaining mains/rice/sides after the snacks/apps/duck.Service is nice, although a touch spotty -- they rushed us through ordering (and ordering can be confusing/overwhelming), but lagged towards the end of the meal. The space is a little cramped (aside from the bar, everybody sits at a long family-style table), but if you come with a party of 3 you can claim the heads of the table and get more space that way.We got:- Sitting Down for Dinner cocktail (super good, would recommend -- though the duck fat flavor is not evident at all)- Impeached cocktail (also good)- Old Man's Mountain (also good)- Decoy Chips (these are not chips, and more fried crispy fish skin -- SO GOOD)- Assorted Pickles- Sweet Potato Noodles with Uni (good, but probably wouldn't order again)- Oxtail Dumplings (good, but probably wouldn't order again)- Grilled Wagyu Beef Pieces (super good, would order again!)- Duck (duh)- Grilled Pork Toro with Rice Cakes (wasn't a fan -- the meat texture was off and rubbery)- Soft & Crunchy Vegetable Rice (good, but a little boring)- Asparagus with XO sauce (good, but a little boring)",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

For a group of 4 you get 4 small plates, 2 main dishes, a whole Peking duck, and a rice or side. They also give you several types of house pickles and fish skin chips (which sounds weird but were really good). For our small plates we had the oxtail dumplings (delicious and the sauce on the side ROCKS), the bbq pork lettuce wraps (fine but a little salty - I would skip this one), uni with sweet potato noodles (good and fresh), and the wagyu beef (good flavor but not that tender). For our mains we had the sea bass (perfectly cooked and flavorful) and the rib steak (which all of us preferred to the wagyu appetizer). And obviously we had the duck. Which everyone agreed was AMAZING. They give you three sauces - sesame, hoisin, and cranberry - but you should stick with the original hoisin.

Great value!We booked the Sunday dinner almost one month ago as we really wanted to try Peking Duck here. $68.5 fix menu per person, and believe me, you will get more food than you can imagine from just reading through its menu...We got three small plates of vegetable pickles, fish skin chips with house special salsa, Wagyu beef with source, four large beef dumplings, a large bowl of seafood fried rice, AND a WHOLE Peking Duck.... We tried our best to eat as much as we could, and we left with a big take out bag of half duck and all the fried rice. LOLThe space was tiny and most tables are placed tightly side-by-side.

Indeed, it is very small that they have to share with Redfarm upstairs if you have party of more than 4.Otherwise, you will painfully share your privacy with your neighbors whom you just met 1 sec ago and barely leave an impression with each other.Place is beautiful tho, everything is decorated by heart, some lights, some plants and some chopsticks which is cut from the tree. Yes, they are trying to make you feel like you eat something right from the garden (at least, i felt something impressions like that)Reservation: is needed if you want to eat ducks and make sure that you make your appointment crystal clear and be there on time. Otherwise, duck belongs to someone else.Food: if you want to have duck, you will have to eat their pre-fix.We are a group of 4, who reserved ducks pre-fixed. and in addition to that, we are imformed that we can have 4 small plates, 2 main dishes and choose one between side and rice.Things for free: bass chip, and 6 lord of rings...Both are good.Duck: I think I have such an high expectation on the roasted duck that I almost felt disappointed the way they presented the roasted duck.. In my mind, peking duck, the traditional one, is always cut fresh by a skillful chef. Every piece is accuarte and every piece is fresh. However, decoy 's famous duck only left me with bussiness-owned duck cuisine. For small dish, we had oxtail dumpling, shrimp &snow pea dumpling, mushroom dumpling and octopus salad. ALL ARE GOOD, in particual, the oxtail dumpling. Every moistured and seasoned.Main dish is delicious too! The rib steak is some of the best I have ever had in NYC. Medium rare is a good choice to have and the dish will leave you with a chewy steak taste and a mood that you wanna eat again.Seabass is good too and fresh. But I prefer steak better.Overall: what stunning me was not their ducks but their reguarly dish. They can deinitely make a name based on their quality dish.4 stars.Recommend",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I don't think I've had one better than the meal we had there. We were a party of 7 for Thanksgiving night and after making reservations EARLY in advance, we were seated quickly and easily. Our waiter was kind and attentive. Since we were a party of 7, we were offered 4 small plates, 3 main courses, a rice and a side...and 2 Peking ducks. We started with the oxtail dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the beef wontons and the lettuce wraps. The oxtail dumplings were PHENOMENAL with a delicious sauce accompanying them. The lettuce wraps were also amazing and I would definitely recommend both. The shrimp dumplings were tasty and the beef wontons were just okay. Next we had the ducks, which were paired with thin pancakes and sauces. Never in my life have I eaten such crispy, moist delicious duck. The meal could've stopped there, but then we got our main courses which were: the shrimp, the sea bass, and the lamb. All three dishes came with lots of veggies and were so flavorful. Just thinking about it is making me hungry again!While this restaurant is EXPENSIVE, it's worth every penny and feels sophisticated without being ""uppity."" It has a friendly, cozy vibe.

50,Jm0PZmqCqM3sBKt_3de_lg,June S.,5.0 star rating,"When I found out that my husband had never had Peking Duck, I had to get him to have one. I have had really good Peking duck, and and then not-so-great Peking duck, and those were such huge difference that I knew that I had to take him to a really good place. After my research, I decided on Decoy, since it was said as one of the best place to have Peking duck. I quickly made reservation. The inside is rather small. Most of the seating here is a long communal table. This could be a bit awkward if you are not used to sitting next to a stranger. Also, depends on where you are sitting, it takes long time to get in and out, making it difficult just getting to the bathroom. Right by the entry door, there were two separate nooks with seating on each side. One side is a counter seats for three people. On the other side is a private table for two people. For some awesome luck, we got to have the private table for two!!! We were so happy... Good things happens to good people!From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly by the manager, Craig. He took us to our nice private table, and once learned that this was our first time visiting Decoy, he took time to explain their menu to us. Super nice! When our waitress came over, she also explained the menu to us, they are all really nice here. The prix fixe Peking Duck menu comes with Homemade Pickles, Decoy Chips, Duck Consommé Shots, 10 Pancakes, 3 sauces, choice of small plates, and choice of fried rice or veggie side. The portion of each items are adjusted depending on your party size so that everyone gets good amount of food. As for duck itself, they provide 1 duck per party of 5 or less. So, basically, the less friends you bring, the more duck you will have... LOLOne thing I have to mention is their bathroom. I waited for a quite a while, almost made me wonder if there is really someone in the restroom, or if the door nob is broken??? After a while, a young female came out, almost running away. When I got inside, I realized that she was running away from her shame...she obviously could not figure out how to flush the high tech toilet!!! LOL! She could at least warn me and said ""I am sorry, I couldn't flush it..."" So, they have this super cool Japanese toilet, TOTO. The control panel was installed on top of the toilet paper holder, and there you find the button function for ""flush."" Maybe the restaurant should put out an instructional sign that indicates how to flush the toilet.Ok, done with the toilet part. As I mentioned, the staffs here are very efficient, friendly, and they know their stuff. Our waitress was really nice too. Our water was filled, dirty dishes picked up quickly, and clean plates delivered without asking for it. The manager, Craig does a great job looking over the entire restaurant, constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy. We certainly were super happy!As this is a small restaurant, they do take the reservation very seriously. Once you make the reservation, the commitment to the duck feast needs to be given to the restaurant in a form of your credit card information. If you decide not to show up, they will charge you a penalty fee. They will also ask you to confirm the reservation either by email or phone. If you do not confirm your reservation by 4pm on the day of your reservation, they might not hold your seat. It might sound like an extra stress, but nowadays, many other restaurants call you a day before to confirm your reservation also.

I've been here twice, and both in the winter time. A few observations about the space:Location: DOWNSTAIRS below RedFarm.Seating is tight- you're literally seated on this super long dining table and are eventually snug up against the people you're next to. All your dishes and glasses on the table is fit exactly and has to be put back in its exact place becase there is just no extra room. Bar seating is very close too, so in the winter when everyone has their big puffy coats, it really is a tight fit. Also to note- in the winter, the edge of the long table by the door and the two seater by the door can get REALLY CHILLY. If it's important to you, you can mention in your reservation that you'd prefer sitting inside closer to the kitchen where its warmer, and the reverse during the summertime. Decoy is SO WORTH IT THOUGH! I've loved everything I've tried here- from all the different sauces (note that their cranberry sauce is made from scratch and tart!!!) for the peking duck ""taco"" to the crab and scallop fried rice and all the appetizers did not disappoint! Service is quick and they may not have an official drink menu but it'll be provided to you verbally, as I assume they're seasonal and subject to change.

You will also need to put down your credit card for the reservation.After we secured a reservation for a weekend night two weeks in advance, we patiently waited for a great meal. We arrived soon after the opened for my first Peking duck meal ever. My wife has had duck before but I was very excited.Upon entry, this place is your classic basement level restaurant where anyone would be amazed that high end restaurant could function in such tight quarters. Craig, the manager, welcomed us and gave us a seat near the window. The majority of the seats are in the communal table space.For the food, it was a great feast. Everything on the small plates menu looked so good so it was a little difficult but we ordered the Shrimp Stuffed Shishito Peppers and the Kumamoto oysters in yuzu sauce with caviar. Before small plates, you are served homemade pickles which had three types of kimchi cauliflower, kimchi cucumbers, and pickled mango. With the pickles, there was Decoy chips which were super tasty fish chips.For our two libations, we had the Chinese Tsingtao beer for $9 and the Impeached for $14 which is made with Monkey Shoulder, Cynar, Peach Shrub, Shiso, and Yuzu.Finally for the feast, we had the duck. Just before they served it, they gave use a small shot glass of duck consommé which prepped our palates for the duck. The duck is served three sauces that were Cranberry, Peanut Butter & Sesame, and Hoisin sauce. The duck also comes with a whole duck, with legs, 10 pancakes, scallions, and crispy fried whole shallots.We decided to go for one dessert to finish off the meal. The Ginger Panna Cotta with Blueberry Compote for $10 was worth. The fruit was fresh and the panna cotta was very light.Overall Craig and the team did a great job.

59,9c4k9R3ZMymYgca8w-42ZA,D. L. J.,4.0 star rating,"Decoy is a cozy subterranean spot beneath Red Farm specializing in Peking Duck. The space is comprised of a bar area (for those without reservations, but sadly no duck available unless reserved in advance), as well as one long communal table for those with reservations.  It's a tight space, so parties of varying sizes are all seated side by side at the one table.  It also means reservations must be carefully choreographed - lingering is difficult, and there is limited space for waiting for your fellow diners, so plan accordingly.We came as a party of 4, which worked well for their menu concept.  For a fixed price ($68), our party received one duck with accompaniments, four appetizers, two main courses and one side (rice or vegetable).  Plenty of food, especially when complimentary pickled vegetables and fish skin chips are thrown in to start.The duck really lives up to expectations - it was succulent and flavorful, certainly as good as those I've had at nicer restaurants in Beijing.  It duck came with three tasty sauces, an interesting peanut, semi-tart cranberry and traditional hoisin.  Found the size of the bird provided to be just right for our group, each person had ~2-3 servings.  Our starters were also quite nice - Katz's Pastrami Triangles, Foie Gras and Strawberry Tarts, Oxtail Dumplings, Grilled Wagyu, it is hard to pick a favorite, they were all good.  I enjoyed the Lamb for main course as well, which had a nice amount of heat.  Really, all of the food was nicely done.Tried a few of the cocktails, all of which were decent, but I especially liked the El Luchador which had Tequila, Ancho Reyes, Grapefruit, Lime and Ginger - excellent for a late summer evening.Overall, had a great time and recommend Decoy as a nice spot for catching up with friends.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Another great gem in the West Village.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

From the reviews, I was interested to try this but didn't look too much at the menu beforehand. Both the drink menu and food menu is interesting. I got a drink which had some sort of ""paking duck fat washed whiskey"" whatever that means. The drink was good, but seems like a few words added to the drink to make it seem more interesting than it really was. Too many people do this. Sorry, I don't know what Mr. Washburne's Burnt Peach Gin is, and neither do most people. Couldn't really taste anything different in there to be honest. Solid drink nonetheless, but the words were more interesting than the flavor.The food menu itself looked good and we started with a few appetizers such as oxtail dumplings and pastrami triangles. They had decent flavor, but nothing too special. It seemed like each of these were missing something to make it from decent to good/great. Were they good? They had fairly good flavor but unfortunately, nothing I will remember in a few months.We also got a peking duck. At $78 for one duck, it's rather a steep price compared to so many other places in the country. I've seen various publications like GQ (hm, who listens to them about Chinese food anyway?) rank this as the best peking duck in NYC. Is it so much better than the rest? It is for sure above average and better than others in town, but it's not so much better that you would pay that much more for it. The pancakes and peking duck sauce are pretty standard as is everything else that comes with it. My girlfriend, who went to college in Beijing, agreed with me on this. Better than average for the US, but definitely overpriced.This review has me a little torn. On one hand, I thought our small plates were just average and were missing something to make them more memorable. On the other hand, the duck was definitely above average and the drinks were solid. Unfortunately, the duck wasn't so much above average that induced a ""everybody else in NYC is doing it wrong."" type of epiphany that would make me pay 100% more than most other places in town.Do I think it's worth a visit?

Walked in with a party of two soon after opening on a Saturday night without a reservation and still got the Peking Duck prix fixe. We started with the oxtail dumplings which are generously sized deep-fried dumpling with crispy dumpling wrappers. Biting into the dumpling dipped in the black garlic aioli yielded an impressive saucy center with pulled oxtail meat. The duck was similarly juicy and good temperature without any accompaniment but the duck skin, while perfectly roasted, could use a lot more flavor. It did not have the same honey glaze I remember in Beijing at Da Dong. There is no performance of preparing the duck at the table, as the style of restaurant is more hole in the wall service with a large communal table, one two top closer to the door and window, and a long bar. The Peking Duck prix fixe accompaniments are the warm consomme soup (clear broth) shots for consuming before duck, stir-fried pickled shallots, 10 thin round wraps, 3 sauces (hoisin, cranberry, peanut), and fresh julienned scallions and cucumber (no skin/seeds). The truffle egg fried rice is fried rice with corn kernels and chopped scallions entirely covered by a steamed egg with truffle oil mixed in and no garnish over the top. Breaking the egg to mix into the rice was a fragrant experience. However, overall a bit overpriced for the dish though great for meal.  The composite meal was worthy for sampling. My guest and I also had the Banana Bread Daiquiri (a tiki drink) and Rock In Tokyo (which is perfect for those who have an affinity for Old Fashioned). Both had impressive presentation.

But they were scrumptious and not at all fishy. The lemon and finely chopped veggies were complimentary. The very luxurious treat was the foie gras strawberry rhubarb tart. Its shaped like a turkey or duck. You pop the whole thing in your mouth and damn. its. good.When it comes to the actual peking duck, it doesn't disappoint. Amazing flavors, crisp skin and although duck is a fattier meat, it is cooked down to the point that you never bite into a fat blob.

65,YdHKdY8vTSOUdvEuL_EBSA,Hyesil C.,4.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were craving peking duck one night after work and ended up at Decoy hoping for a table as we walked in right when they opened. Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the long communal table alongside the bar and let me tell you, we definitely got our duck fix here. There are maybe 2 individual tables in the front by the window but that's it- the rest is seating along the communal table. I can see it getting a bit tight but it was okay for my boyfriend and I as we only had another couple seated on one side of us. We opted for the pre-fixe once we knew that the duck entrée was no different when ordering from the pre-fixe or a la carte. Our meal started with some complimentary pickled veggies/ fruit with fish skin. Don't let complimentary fool you- these were amazing. The fish skin chips were so crispy and flavorful with the sauce that comes out with it. Our appetizers were the Katz pastrami triangles, the oxtail dumplings and ordered an extra side of the shishito peppers. The katz pastrami triangles were delicious but thought they can be more innovative rather than just standard mustard for the sauce. The oxtail dumplings were so beyond flavorful and rich- so rich that I was more than content after having one. The shishito peppers were stuffed generously with shrimp and very tasty. Then came the highlight of the meal- the peking duck. The dish came out with the pancakes to wrap the duck in and 3 sauces (hoisin, raspberry, peanut sauce) to try your duck with. I personally enjoyed the classic hoisin the best. The wraps are warm and the duck is so beyond juicy, tender, crispy and had just the right amount of fat. My boyfriend and I devoured this dish and found ourselves running out the of pancakes at the end. Fill your pancakes with the duck people! The crab rice that came out with the duck was also very tasty. The portion was huge so we were not able to finish it. While the appetizers were all very delicious, I don't think I would HAVE to try them again (minus the peppers) so next time I hit up decoy, I'll probably try some different appetizers and definitely get the duck with the rice!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

At first, I was surprised by the small size of the restaurant and sharing the large table with others, but this is NYC so what do you expect? Prefix menu starts at $68.50 per person. You get to select 2 appetizers and 1 side dish or rice. You may also opt to order something from the entree menu, but it's not included in the prefix price. We stuck with what was included in the prefix and the food was more than enough for 2 people! We left feeling full, satisfied, and happy! For drinks, I had the King's Crown which was big, cold, and refreshing. I loved it! It was a great girl drink. Not too strong. For dinner, they started you off with the 3 vinegared cups of cucumbers, mango, and cauliflower. They were tangy and delicious! I liked the mango one, but my BF loved the cauliflower one. Next, came with crispy fried fish skin. Yumm! Light, airy, (not greasy) fish skin dipped in a light sauce. Great starter! Then, our food. We ordered:Appetizers:- Oxtail Dumplings - Amazing!!! Definitely something new and unique for me, but I loved every minute of eating it. The crispy shell, gooey, soft, hot oxtail inside, OMG... so good! It goes excellent with the sauce! A must-order!!! - Foie Gras Strawberry Tart - Who doesn't love foie gras?? This was small, and good, but I felt like the foie gras needed to be bigger. Rice Dish: - Scallops & Crab Fried Rice - A definite winner and worth the extra $8 supplement price. There were crab chunks in the rice and the tasted tasted smoky fried. Mmm...was delish! Finally, the main course... The Peking Duck was PHENOMENAL! Crispy skin, moist and full-bodied flavor meat. Honestly, THE  BEST Peking Duck I've ever had! They give you a generous portion to share. It comes with crispy radish daikons, cut green onions/shallots, warm flour bread for wrapping, 2 warm shots of duck consommé , and 3 sauces: hoisin, peanut sauce, and cranberry.

70,GZsxx8hFLS3ACv7XFFeWfQ,Biqi C.,5.0 star rating,"We were a group of 4 with a 6:30pm reservation on a Thursday night. We originally wanted to just eat duck  and planned to order 2 with some sides. But the restaurant just had enough ducks for all reservations that night so that wasn't an option. We opted for prix fixe for 4 and below is what we got. Nothing was short of excellent really. The only thing we would have changed was probably the fried rice option. 7 pickled apps + fish skin chips - all amazing1 duck - definitely enough for the four of us, didn't need more. It might be the best peking duck in NYC? If we're talking any duck though, I'm a bigger fan of Balthazar's duck comfit, and 11 madison's signature duck. I studied abroad in Beijing and had duck at a few well known establishments there including Da Dong which is supposed to be coming to NYC soon, and I felt the duck skin in at Decoy could have been crispier, but appreciate that they made the thin pancakes which is supposed to be the hardest part I think.4 apps:Oxtail dumpling - our favorite, if you're a fan of oxtail the flavor is really brought out hereKatz Pastrami dumplings - really good, not what i expectedWagu Beef - small cup of really tender beef, really goodShrimp stuffed shishito peppers - these were bigger than expected, and really good2 mains:We paid the supplement for the Rib Eye and glad we did. SO tender and flavorful. Honestly, I'd come to this restaurant alone for this for a great steakChopped Lamb- kind of tough to share since it was under 1 roti, but flavor was AMAZING. Lamb cubes were a little tough, but whatever.Rice: crab and scallop (meh)We opted for the crab and scallop fried rice because some reviewers here mentioned that iw as worth the $8 supplement. Let me tell you - it's not. Whiel they're generous with the crab and scallop, we all found this to be EXTREMELY bland. The couple next to us got the same thing, barely touched it, and when the server asked them why they didn't want to bag it since they barely touched it, the guy actually said ""it wasn't very good"".We also ordered a ton of drinks and the bill came out to be $150pp. Honestly, for the quality of the food, and the fact we ordered a crap ton of drinks, I didn't think it was expensive at all.

Tasted amazing while eating but noticed later that all I had, after we left, was the taste of soy sauce in my mouth and a serious need for gallons of water. The duck was great because the dark meat was juicy and very, very moist and the skin was perfectly crisp. The combination with the spring onions and what I think was a restaurant made hoisin sauce (plum sauce) was great. I tried the other two sauces that came along with the hoisin but they made the dish mediocre. I had a drink at the bar before being seated and that was great. Delicious concoction! We did the a la carte and also ordered the lobster noodle dish which was good but nothing special. Maybe I waited too long to eat it because I was too busy with the duck but the noddles were overcooked and falling apart by the time I was eating it-- no where near al dente.

75,u3UZ-9wI6RsGC7v0CPAraA,凯雯,2.0 star rating,"nice food. so so service. I don't want to be mean but I must say this. When I called to make a reservation the lady asked for my credit card info and when she required the three digit number on the back of the card I just got dumbed. I asked her and she very rudely tell me that they will charge me for 25 dollars if I don't come. I think she should tell me before she asked for the info. And she very impatiently asked me to double check if my guest were coming. I nearly abandoned this plan, I had high expectations. Now she just ruined it. Yes you are a small restaurant and need to make sure and can't afford to wait for someone who won't come. But I think the rude manner does not solely come from this but also the owner or the staff thinks their restaurant is so popular and has done very good promotion of their image. What is even worse, they very rudely moved our plates just to make some place for the other guests coming. You could have made better explanations, say some nice words before you moved our things. When we still have a whole plate of Chinese broccoli in front of us and some duck meat, the waiter came to ask whether we are done eating. Then 5 minutes later the waitress came asking the same question and then the waiter came again another 5 minutes later. A family of 5 people ate at a earlier time than us and wasn't getting pushed. Or was it because we are Chinese? The staff seem like Asian too. This is too far. Yes I understand you are a small restaurant. But you also charge high for the meal. And I made a reservation remember? So I was required to have the pre fix meal and order other things extra. Should I be treated fairly?? Even though I ate in a fast manner, I consider asking me for once is all right, for twice and the third time pushing??? Making money for your restaurant like that is not appropriate and not appreciated. To think I even took nice picture of your food, that's called appreciation! And that takes some of my eating time too if we are clocked! We came to your restaurant because we trust our friends' recommendations and we came to appreciate the food and enjoy the service.

I believe if the chef decided to decrease the duck's price even alittle bit this review would be a 5 star and he would probably have a much higher return rate. I would personally love to come back but at $70 some what dollars a head for a duck and a few dishes makes it truly difficult to return.

Overhead greenery and back splash panorama last dinner duck illustration set a good mood for the feast. Well designed lightings, with no glaring spot lights. Well combined usage of Edison bulbs and indirect lighting source created soft relaxing warm light in dark rustic decor fixtures.3 small pickled dishes with fried fish skin came first. Fried fish skin were great to munch on with southeast asian flavored chili fish sauce. 3 pickled dishes (pickled pineapple, cucumber and cauliflower) Cauliflower was prepared the way like Korean pickled cabbage, it was very good in texture, crunchy and spicy. Pickled pineapple is a sweet & savory combo that balanced well with the fried fish skin.Strawberry foie gras-Fresh strawberry slices added tartness to the rich melt-in-your mouth foie gras to cut down the grease. But the amount of strawberry preserves jam were too much and too sweet in the crispy flaky tart base holder, it needed to rebalance in proportion, so it won't be such a overkill.Kumamoto oyster & Yuzu ice were good choice before the main duck dish appearance.These appetizers come with the duck dinner set menu for two. Otherwise I usually wouldn't pay for Kumamoto oyster since it's more expensive. Compares to cheap blue point oyster they are more fishy and more metallic taste, but I do agree they are more interesting and complex on flavor palette. Yuzu peel oil aroma and acidity eases inexperienced oyster eaters. Overall appetizers were all very refreshing, well balanced favor and innovative with fusion spirit.Full bar with an extensive bourbon and whisky lines. Didn't drink this time but definitely will try for the next visit. And for the star of the show- roasted duck.First of all, good choice on duck picking, crispy skin with no thick greasy fat. You can tell they blow right amount of air evenly into the duck to separate the fat from the meat and the skin. Fat were well drained during roasting. Coloring of the skin is beautiful. Meat were tender, moist and well cut. Bravo for the dough skin wrap. It's authentic like the way they make in Beijing. Fresh made wrap skin, thin and moist in good size round, sided with sliced raw green scallion, cucumber. The addition of fried green onion and pickled pearl onion, added crunch to the every bite. 3 choices of sauces provided enough versatility for every wrap. Personalization is the key showing attention to duck dinner menu design by the chef. Each person get to make their own duck wrap roll, it's enough choices to finish all the duck meat without getting bored.   Everything was well made, I personally like the duck to be just a bit fattening, so the duck fat lubricate the skin dough. It's definitely more westernized and more healthy now.When the scallop crabmeat fried rice came. We are already full. Portion for this dinner is big for two.Fried rice has the iron wok charred taste, but could be made a little more dry. It's a little too mushy and moist fried rice. I really enjoyed the dinner, pricy too compared to regular Chinatown duck places. The overall experience were topnotch.

I had made the reservation a month in advance. When we got there, we were seated right away and had the only 2-top in the restaurant. We had a great waitress who explained the menu to us and we started with a couple of tasty cocktails ($14 each). Then we were given the amuse bouche of tangy assorted pickles and crispy Decoy chips. We demolished the fish skin chips... For our 2 small plates, we chose the oxtail dumplings and strawberry foie gras tarts. The oxtail dumplings were amazing, must try! Additionally, we tried their truffle chicken soup dumplings ($20 for 2) which were rich with flavor and delicious. Next, a whole duck was placed on our table with 3 sauces, all the fixins, and consumme shots. Succulent, tender, and with crispy skin, the duck lived up to the hype. Veggie fried rice was a good sidekick, but nothing special. Lastly, ginger panna cotta ended the meal on a great note. Smooth and creamy, yet not too sweet.Ended up leaving with a doggy bag of leftovers that were enough for another meal (they even threw in extra wraps for the duck!).

Forget about whatever else is on the menu, just order the prix fixe Peking duck.It is absolutely the best Peking duck you will eat. The duck is tender, nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. Unlike at other Chinese restaurants -- where you can end up picking bones out of your mouth when you eat duck -- this meat (other than the legs) is boneless. The three sauces that go with it -- hoisin, peanut and (yes) cranberry highlight the duck nicely.The side dish of snow pea shoots was interesting and well done. It was stir fried with garlic and went well with the meal.Each meal comes with appetizers and an amuse-bouche of fried fish skins, pickles, cauliflower in kimchi seasoning and mangoes in a mustard sauce. Each of them were a creative touch for the meal.For dessert we had the key lime pie and the pana cotta with blueberries and ginger. After a meal like we had, an overly sweet dessert would not do. And these were not overly sweet or extra large. They were a perfect ending for the meal.I highly recommend a visit to this place if you are in the West Village.

I've been here once with my husband for a dinner for two and other times have been with bigger parties - it doesn't matter, the experience is great for both. The restaurant is small and has a really unique, cool vibe. Bartenders are friendly and know what they are doing (you can have dinner at the bar). The menu is pre-fix with a plethora of side dishes/appetizers to choose from, and the duck is just very well executed - crispy skin, fat, meat, pancake, onion, and a trio of excellent sauces. Price point is more expensive than say, a Peking Duck house in Chinatown, but just overall, a far superior meal.

Amuse bouche was 6 vegetable sides (like banchan at korean restaurants), with deep-fried fish skin similar to pork rinds. so.much.food. We ordered: oxtail dumplings (fried and stuffed like an empanada), oysters (refreshing), bbq pork lettuce wraps (nice and smoky), shrimp stuffed peppers (fried, just average), pork toro (a little oily but dangerously addictive), black sea bass (steamed, clean eats), lamb (a little chewy), crab and scallop fried rice (underwhelming), sauteed snow pea leaves (cooked simply with garlic and oil). The duck itself seemed a bit small, enough for 2 wraps per person. They provide interesting sauces, but go for the traditional: wrap down + 2 pieces of duck + schmear of hoisin sauce + 2 slices of scallion and cucumber. Fold the bottom up 1/3rd of the way, roll into a wrap, eat happily. The skin could've been crisper, but the duck itself was very tender and juicy. I highly recommend going with a group of 4-6 people so that you can sample a lot of other dishes.

In China, we don't eat this dish by it self for sure. I'm giving the duck here an average comparing to those back in China. Even if I want to order some dishes to eat together with the duck, there is no room on the table because you are being seated on the same table with other people.

The a la carte prices are ridiculous, and with 4 or more, you get a prix fixe that is UNBELIEVABLY cheaper. A la carte is $78 for a duck, and then however much for appetizers, sides, entrees, etc. The prix fixe is $68.50, and comes with (for a party of 7, at least) - 4 appetizers (which WHOA this place breaks from ALL other restaurant appetizer protocol and gives EVERY PERSON a piece, so...order dumplings for 7 people, you get 7 dumplings, etc), 3 entrees (aside from the duck), a side, and a rice. INCLUDED.Cocktails - all very inventive and pleasant. Some of the ingredients are pretty unique, and I liked everything I tasted. The timelessness was my favorite - sort of like a sweeter, more full sazerac.Pickles - Cucumbers, squash, asparagus, shishito peppers....and two others I can't remember. Fantastic banchan.Shrimp and Snow Pea Dumplings - adorable little birds (or are they ghosts?) in a much larger than average dumpling. Think a soup dumpling sized dumpling, but with a thin rice skin. You honestly can't go wrong with any of the shrimp-related dishes here. Plump, juicy, and much better tasting than ghosts usually are.Shrimp stuffed Shishito Peppers - these are deep fried and are like the jalapeno poppers you once had ""one of those"" kind of dreams about. Mild heat. Perfectly seasoned. Crisp. Other adjectives.Pastrami Triangles - Little crispy pockets of pastrami with a light funky mustard sauce. If you need more than two bites, you're being like my sister who would savor her food so long that we'd all get irritated that the next course couldn't come. Don't be like that. CHOMP THIS SH*T.Foie Gras and Strawberry Tartlet - You're a dumb moron if you don't get this. What's wrong with you? It's a fat cube of PERFECTLY cooked foie gras with fresh strawberries in a turkey-shaped tart. If all turkeys were made from foie gras, you'd hate your Republican uncle less at Thanksgiving.Duck - Obviously what you came for. And lives up to the hype in every way. The fatty crisp texture of the skin, the perfectly cooked meat. There is nothing I can say here that hasn't been said already. Only two suggestions - take the consomme amuse bouche like a shot; don't be a wiener who sips an amuse bouche. And ignore the other sauces. Go hoisin or go home. Be hoisin'ed by your own canard (this is the best Yelp line I have ever written).Lamb - I believe this was a prix fixe only special. It's extremely tender, reminiscent of cumin lamb from a yunnanese place, but with a sauce more like a curry. Excellent.Pork with Rice Cakes - I probably could have had a double portion of this, but people were already stuffed, because I have some skinny f*king friends. The rice cakes could have been crisper, but, c'mon. Highly recommended.Sea Bass - Perfectly cooked. The table thought this was the best entree, and most of them aren't fish lovers. It's like velvet with veggies around it. The leeks were delightfully crispy. Scallop and Crab Fried Rice - there was a bit of a supplement to this versus the other fried rices, While the rice could have been a bit more moist or a bit more crispy (gotta pick an extreme for fried rice), there was oodles of crab in here (OODLES), and tiny little plump scallops that were neither bay nor sea, and I have no idea where they came from. Baby scallops? We need to kill more scallops in their infancy, it seems.Go to this f'king place. With a group. You're welcome, ungrateful Yelpers.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I took my mom, a born and bred Bejing-er, here for her birthday to see how good the duck really is here. So harboring a stomach full of doubt, we were pleasantly surprised at how amazing the meal was! The prix fixe deal is so worth the money and we were completely stuffed walking out of the restaurant. Every bite of food was better than the last and of course, the duck itself was delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Chinese food with a Western twist. It is especially good for bigger groups because you can try way more items. For a group of 4, we could order 4 small plates, 2 entrees and 1 rice item in addition to the full duck. Now, for the procession of amazing flavor combinations and beautifully designed plates: Amuse bouche: - Decoy chips (crispy fish skin chips): Better than any potato chip I've ever had. The skins were perfectly crispy with a fatty fishy flavor that added a layer of depth to the chips. - Platter of housemade pickles and kimchi: I wanted buckets of each of the items to take home and eat with everything. The pickled Chinese broccoli was especially tender which was surprising, since it's usually a part of the vegetable we throw away. The pickled kimchi cauliflower was my favorite of them all, so tangy and sweet at the same time. Perfect way to start off the meal.Appetizers (in order of most favorite to least): - Sea Scallops with shrimp and chives dumpling: My favorite of the bunch. Although it required a supplement, it was very worth the  money. The scallops were huge and pan fried to perfection. The dumpling was delicate and delicious as well. The plate also had a fried wonton topping that reminded me of the topping in egg drop soup. So creative! - Foie gras and strawberries tart: An interesting combination I've never had before that works so well! The rich, fatty foie was complemented by the sweet and tart strawberries. The tart was formed in the shape of a duck which was adorable as well- Oxtail dumplings: Crispy golden shell on the outside filled with what tasted like an oxtail stew on the inside, delicious! - Oysters: Refreshing and sweet with just a hint of sea waterDuck: - Peking duck: The main attraction of the night did not disappoint. The duck itself had a delicious crispy skin that you could eat like chips and the meat was so juicy and tender. You get wraps, cucumbers, green scallions and 3 different sauces to make awesome duck wraps. I loved how they kept true to the traditional way of eating Peking duck in wraps but was creative in creating 3 different sauces (hoisin, cranberry, peanut butter and sesame paste) to choose from, none of which are traditional. Entree: - Sauteed diced lamb: Tender, flavorful pieces of lamb stirfried with hot peppers and sitting on top of a thin buttery naan bread to soak up all the savory lamb sauce. Perfection in every bite.- Steamed sea bass: The sea bass was slightly disappointing. The fish was a little dry and fishy tasting since the skin was left on. However, the black bean sauce was very rich and was perfect slathered over the rice. - Vegetable fried rice: Best vegetable fried rice I've ever tasted. There was so many different vegetables that the texture of the dish was fantastic. The flavors went so well together and the dish was very colorful. All in all, amazing food and service. The setting was also very intimate and decor was tasteful. Absolutely recommend this place as a splurge with friends sort of night. - Pro tip, ask your waiter for the duck carcass to take home at the end of the meal, you can make a killer duck bone soup or duck ramen with it later. They also leave a lot of the meat on the bone still so you can definitely make another couple meals out of it.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Make reservations, it does get busy. A long bar to eat at, too, if you don't mind that.Amuse bouche was fried rainbow trout skin with a garlic miso sauce - excellent starter.We also had the assorted pickled vegetables (a good mix of spicy and sour), the Katz's pastrami triangles (good, but oddly out of place), oxtail dumplings (delicious though a bit heavy on the dough), and shrimp & snow pea leaf dumplings (ok, I've had better in Chinatown).I've had better Peking Duck. There, I've said it to start. The hand-made wraps were good, but the duck tasted flat, not full of flavor like the ones I've had elsewhere in the city. The best part was the duck shot, a reduced, hyper-flavored shot of duck-infused broth that came with the duck. Tasty and I've had almost nothing like it. That must be where all the flavor went, because otherwise I didn't have nearly that sense of flavor from the duck.  Three sauces - a cranberry (eh), standard hoisin sauce (tasted straight out of a can, tinny), and sesame sauce (hit and miss with the table).Other items we shared - the teriyaki-marinated ribeye - fantastic juicy flavor and perfect texture. Saved the review, really. Fried rice with scallops and shrimp was ok, but serving it was harder than I would think out of the little wooden container. Had to ask for a bigger spoon. And the fish special that night with asparagus was ok, but did not wow anyone.Overall, good hits, a few misses. Will try other dishes here the next time.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

We went with a party of 2 for the peking duck prix fixe menu, which comes with a whole peking duck of course in addition to 2 small plates of your choice, either a rice or side dish, and several amuse-bouches.The dishes come fast and furious soon after you order and we were struggling to both enjoy the awesome fishes and also clear the table for the next set of dishes (a good thing).They started us off with 4 amuse-bouches, a plate of crispy fish skin in addition to small cups of cauliflower, butternut squash, and mango appetizers. Each of the amuses were prepared a different way and packed with flavor. The kimchi flavored cauliflower was my personal favorite but everything was wonderful.For our small plates, we chose the grilled wagyu beef slices and oxtail dumplings. As it turns out, both were delectable and perhaps the best 2 dishes of the night. The wagyu beef is packed with flavor and was my personal favorite dish of the night. It is extraordinary both by itself and paired with the kimchi veggies on the side. The oxtail dumplings come fried and essentially filled with flavorful oxtail meat. There is a generous portion of sauce that comes with it.We chose the scallop and crab fried rice as our side dish and it was probably my least favorite of the night. While there was a ton of scallops and crab in the fried rice dish, it did lack some seasoning. If there was more salt and pepper, I think it would have had a lot of potential.The main course was of course the peking duck. It comes with 10 pancakes, plenty of garnish and 3 different sauces - the standard hoisin, a cranberry sauce and a peanut sauce. The duck itself was perfectly cooked and the skin - OH MY, THE SKIN - was the best part. Crispy, oily, flavorful, it was everything that I love when eating duck skin. Needless to say, we devoured every last piece of meat on our plate. It was as good as any peking duck I've had in the country and I've had a lot of peking duck in my time. And it wasn't even the best dish I had during the meal, that says a lot.Overall, the meal is well worth the money and while the peking duck was a good as advertised, it was everything else that really makes Decoy stand above its peers. The peking duck is as good as I've had outside of China, but the other dishes are what make this place special.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

The duck was on point.  It tasted very similar to what you can get in Chinatown at Peking duck house but it was more refined.  The sauce flavors and the shallot toppings definitely gave it an edge. Since we were stuck waiting, they offered us complimentary shishito peppers.  Overall, I think this place is overpriced for what you are getting and I was a bit turned off by the wait.  What's the point of making a reservation if you have to sit and wait doing nothing for almost 40 mins?",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Instead, they offer a unique menu accented with seasonal tastes and spices. Upon entering, there is a large communal table adjacent to a bar. There was only one private table, which the two of us were seated at. As first timers, we went with the highly acclaimed prix fixe, which came with two small plates, one side, and of course the peking duck, complete with peanut, hoisen, cranberry sauces, along with 10 steaming hot pancakes. For small plates, the fois gras and wagyu beef gave my tastebuds a refreshing kick; the former had a delicate balance of tart from the strawberry to complement the fattyness and richness of the fois gras. Wagyu beef was as expected, but nothing to write home about. The duck was prepared in an excellent fashion -- juicy, but not too oily as typically seen in other establishments.

And of course, we each ordered a glass of the Decoy Red Blend wine (heaven to one's palette) to pair with our Decoy Peking Duck.  The platter of Peking Duck was beautifully engrossed with layers of meat, crispy skin, and duck legs.  Duck meat, crispy skin, some fresh veggies, and cranberry sauce all wrapped in a thin pancake = pure awesomeness.  For dessert, we shared the mango pudding (it was a verbal dessert menu, so I can't remember the exact name).  Our meal at Decoy may have exceeded our expectations - we both really enjoyed it!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I'm originally from beijing, it's still a few steps away from the real deal, but def as close as I've ever had else where. Reservation should be made at least 2 wks in advance bc they make limited number of ducks per night. We were served with their house fish skin chips (SO YUMMY! freshly fried, thin and crispy! I could eat them all day!) and a variety of their pickled vegetables (my favorites were the asparagus with wasabi sauce and the cauliflower!). Between the 4 of us, we tried the sweet potato noodle salad with uni (def worth the $12supp! Jus for the visual alone!), wagyu beef (so flavorful), crunch vegie and peanut dumpling (perfectly cooked) and katz pastrami triangles (just as great as the katz pastrami egg rolls from red farm, their sister restaurant upstairs).The duck was great too! Pancakes where cut ver thin... My only compliant would be that the 3 sauces needed improvement. Maybe I'm just not used to having peking duck with cranberry sauce, but I believe at least 1 of the 3 should be authentic sweet bean sauce. Also, the cucumbers should be sliced more thinly, like the scallions. For the main, we got the jerk chicken (moist and tender) and sea bass (not impressed, very bland) and the snow peas (prefect balance, we needed more vegetables to balance this meal out).

It was actually pretty difficult to get a reservation, so we had to settle for a 9pm reservation on a Sunday night. The restaurant has one long wooden table (maybe for 16?), a full bar, and some 2-seater nooks here and there.Coincidentally, there were 5 of us, so it was perfect for the $65 prefixe meal that they offer. It comes with one peking duck (for 5 people), 4 appetizers, 3 main dishes, 1 fried rice, and 1 side. It's actually a whole lot of food........we could barely finish!The first thing we got was their decoy chips, which are deep fried fish skin pieces. These are INSANELY DELICIOUSLY. They basically taste like chicharrón, but so much better since in my opinion it tastes much lighter! I wish we had an endless supply of these... This was followed by a cute wooden plate with 6 mini cups of pickled items. I also loved these, my favorite one was their wasabi-infused chinese broccoli. I liked how they all tasted so different, showcasing different textures and flavors.Our appetizers:Kumamoto Oysters, Yuzu Ice - AH SO DELICIOUS. These were so fresh, had some caviar on top, and came with a small piece of melon. MUST GET!!!!Oxtail Dumplings - these were pretty good too, very flavorful, and spicy.Shrimp Stuffed Shishito Peppers - YUM, and I'm saying this as a person who doesn't really like shrimp.Wagyu Short Rib Skewers - I actually thought this one was the most lackluster out of the bunch, expected more from wagyu.The peking duck came with 10 pancake wraps, 3 sauces (they include a cranberry sauce which is the only one that wasn't as traditional), and a duck consomme shot (basically a really yummy flavorful hot duck broth). This was perfectly cooked with crispy duck skin, and tender duck meat. It came with julienne cucumbers and scallions as well. YUM.Our entrees:*overall feeling about the entrees was that it was all just okay, and overly seasoned/salty. I probably would have been OK with the meal ending after the peking duck, hopefully they'll offer a prefixe option like that in the future that includes appetizers + duck.Pork 'Toro' with Korean Rice Cake - I thought this was just meh.Black Sea Bass, Yellow Leek & Black Beans - best out of the bunch, very tender fish meat with lots of flavor :).Lamb Tagine with Scallion Pancake - I think this came out last, and I really didn't have the appetite to eat much more, but this was definitely way too salty! The scallion pancake (i think that's what it was) was probably the best part, although it was a little too burnt in some areas.Soft & Crunchy Vegetable Fried Rice was pretty great, you could tell the chef really knew how to make this - the crunch came from the vegetables (mainly the onions), pretty good texture contrast!

I'm kind of amazed that I can't find anything questionable about our dinner. everything was on point, even the rice. stuffed shishito peppers: stuffed with shrimp, lightly battered and fried. texturally nice, and the green sauce adds a nice touch of acid and heat. oxtail dumplings: fried and more reminiscent of small empanadas. delicious stewed flavorful oxtail (they're not skimpy). the dipping sauce is a bit sweet and sour with a layer of heat. foie gras tarts: very cute presentation. the foie with the fruit is a nice balance. cucumber and tart shell add the bite you need against the softer elements. and yes, we went for two rounds of these grilled duck with lychee : how could we not order something with duck? tender, the right amount of gamey, smokey grilled flavor and the softened lychee makes for a great skewer. diced lamb cubes: lamb was perfectly tender. hands down, fantastic execution. the cubes sit atop a crispy piece of naan-bread. to my surprise, the naan didn't sog up even though there was sauce on top of it, and we took some time getting to it. there's some in there and some sweet/sour pickled bulbs of something. rice : it's a bit expensive for rice, but it was not clumpy/wet or undercooked. it was a good portion, not a tea cup size like most restaurants.overall : I would come back here, but I'd love to try redfarm as well.  thanks for recovering from my christmasy dessert request by trying to persuade me to order keylime pie.  btw...the toilet is awesome. heated seat is clutch for winter.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Maybe not overly crisp but very flavorful. Meat is juicy and never overcooked. Thin pancakes. My only complaint is the choice of 3 sauces (peanut, cranberry and the standard duck sauce) is a waste.

We came for the duck, which was solid on its own (and waaaay better than Peking duck house), but the other mains and sides are so on point as well. If you don't like Peking duck (said no one ever) you should still come for their other dishes. Stand outs were the uni noodle salad, shrimp and cabbage dumplings and the lamb main dish. The only negative criticism I have is that the decoration is a little morbid. There's a huge last supper-esque  mural with ducks... eating ducks... and there are wooden ducks throughout the restaurant.

The fish skin chips sounded creepy but it was so flavorful and crispy, didn't taste anything like fish. Must order the barbecue pork lettuce wrap and the shrimp stuffed shishito peppers. The  ""two shrimp"" fried rice was good too but I could trade that in for more greens. It's a cozy little place with great service.

It is, after all, located in the West Village, right below upscale dim sum joint RedFarm. And just like Redfarm, they really push the ""elevated"" Chinese vibe here, and they don't do a bad job with it, as the menu, in general, looks pretty inventive and exciting. There aren't really any ""rustic"" looking Chinese food places in the city, yet don't be shocked to see long, wooden, communal tables, kitschy duck paintings on the wall, all in a relatively darkly-lit space. Anyways, our group of 4 was seated next to a couple, likely on a date, because it didn't seem like they knew each other that well. I gotta say, this really isn't the place for a date, unless you don't really mind people being able to listen to your conversation, because I heard EVERYTHING. So sorry. Yikes. So yeah, it's a little cramped. The surprisingly plump Peking duck was pretty nicely sliced and served, complete with pancakes, sauces, and consomme shots. Seriously, the duck is legit good. Also, the foie gras and strawberry tarts were very rich and delicious, and looked expertly presented. Everything in that regard was great, but the shrimp fried rice dish and side of snow pea leaves were a bit off. They were served sort of lukewarm, and at $18 each dish, a huge gaping rip-off. I can get on board with the idea of paying more if the quality or presentation is on par, but these dishes were kinda disappointing. The service was pretty attentive and friendly, which was a shame because a good deal of the food was kinda sub-par. For upscale Chinese, I was really expecting a little bit more. I really wanted to really like this place, but I think it was merely average for the price and execution. This wouldn't be a bad place to get a bunch of small plates, but for Peking duck, I would consider doing Peking Duck House before coming back here. The service at PDH definitely isn't as good, but at about 25% cheaper, you can get just about the same quality of duck, and you don't really have to deal with people listening in on your conversation. In all, Decoy does the duck really well, but for the price of the other dishes, you can do better.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

Originally thought it was going to be super-high end dim sum but really it is just exquisite Asian fusion, with very authentic flavors but western plating and concept. In stead of getting the prix fixe menu, we ordered a la cart.Assorted pickles and cold veggie bites were much more upscale and therefore elevated versions of the free appetizers you would get at Korean restaurants. Nothing crazy but it opened up my appetite for sure. I really enjoyed the flash fried branzino skin chips which were not on the menu and came as a complimentary appetizer from the chef. These were really special. I've never ad these before in my life. So crispy and quite flavorful. Love this. Would definitely get it again if it were on the menu. Shrimp stuffed shishito peppers were a treat. Super juicy while still crispy and they did not skimp out at all on the shrimp! My favorite were the Kumamoto oysters in yuzu ice. You really can taste the cool, refreshing, and citrusy yuzu in here. It is one of my favorite ingredients so I'm biased but the oysters were super fresh and presentation was so beautiful. In fact the presentation for all the dishes were gorgeous. And of course, a fan favorite, I also had the fois gras and strawberry tarts. You can't go wrong with fois gras so I'm not gonna say anymore. And look how cute they look!!! Crab and scallop fried rice seemed like nothing special when compared to the other dishes, but it was a really good fried rice. The portion was really large too so I took it to go and it tasted amazing the next day. They were really generous with the seafood bits in this rice as well. And of course, what everyone is here for, the peking duck with duck consomme shots, pancakes, and sauces. I know Chinese people will want to kill me when I say this, but I feel like this is way better than most Peking duck I've ever had in Beijing. So good. And the pancakes were so thin. I liked all 3 sauces it came with. I took these to do too and it made everything I cooked with the next day superb!Definitely come check this place out.

The place is so dark that it is actually hard for me to see what I am eating.I wish the other duck houses learn their technique in keeping the duck as less oily with shiny perfectly light and crunchy duck skin!  It's perfect Peking Duck.

A while ago I was looking for the best Peking Duck I could find without getting on a 16 hour flight to Hong Kong. I was sure that I could find something locally that has the touch of the old world style of duck. After reading some articles online I came across one that listed all the best places in NY for Peking Duck and Decoy came out on top...so I had to go.Then I found out that to be guaranteed a duck you need a make a reservation which is hard to come by for parties of 4 unless someone cancels. 2 is a lot easier but then it's too much food! With peoples schedules these days it's not that easy to plan a gathering.Anyway this worked like Jamaica taking the hill on the second day of the downhill bobsled when they were a hair quicker than the Swiss!1 Duck, 4 apps, 2 mains, and a side or rice dish are on offer for a party of 4. $65 a head is well worth it. We got the Foie Gras, Wagyu beef, Oxtail dumplings, and shrimp and pea dumplings to start. They are a small enough tasting portion with a massive flavor profile. Normally I would take pictures of each item but I couldn't resist waiting so we just dug in. Chenin Blanc went really well with the first few courses and then a Decoy Merlot with the duck!I have to thank Caroline, who took great care of us and guided us through the menu choices. The rib steak and sea bass were our mains and oh were they good! The snow pea leaves was the side dish and a very important one to balance the meal with some greens. So thanks again Caroline for being so amazing!I would go back tonight if I could...This meal was so worth the wait and I'm glad we all got to do it.

Going to Decoy was an excellent decision.This is some next-level, ascended to food heaven Peking duck. How do you convey with mere words the juiciness of the meat, the crispiness of the skin, the perfect balance of savoriness that all comes together here? The icing on the cake are the shots of consomme that you get beforehand.Aside from that, we got a lot of other food as part of the set menu. Chips made of sea bass skin, delicious. Foie gras and strawberry tarts, oxtail dumplings, some salads to start. Poached sea bass, steak, and seafood fried rice to round out the meal.Also beyond the food, the cocktails at Decoy are awesome, particularly the barrel aged Manhattans and negronis.So why does this not get 5 stars? Because nothing else is as excellent as the Peking duck. I have never been a fan of Red Farm, and in some of these other dishes it shows that they're essentially the same restaurant.

But at 9:30pm tonight we sat down next to an appallingly loud, drunk, screeching group of about eight people in their late 20s, who took up about 40% of the communal table. Despite their being nearly done with their meal, the staff allowed them to continue drinking and yelling at the communal table until at least when we left at 11:30. At one point, one of the men in the group stood up and yelled, to the entire (exceedingly small) restaurant, ""ladies and gentlemen, Robin's part of our friend group now!"" At this, the woman in the group nearest me started pounding on the table and cackling (inches away from our $70 peking duck).It was truly infantile behavior, and it's shameful that the staff did nothing about this--no request to leave, be quiet, anything. I can't believe a restaurant with a $100 check per head, which requires reservations weeks in advance for a Saturday seating, would allow their guests to be subject to behavior befitting a college bar. I actually had to stop talking at the several moments the women next to me screamed so loudly I couldn't hear the words coming out of my own mouth.And so it's with a heavy heart that I have to give a restaurant whose food easily earns five stars a one star review--but it reflects how bad a taste these people, and Decoy's failure to intervene, left in my mouth.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

For $65 per person, you get a decent amount of food, but probably not $65 worth.- Homemade PicklesThis is the first thing that comes out, along with chunks of mangos and kimchi pickled cauliflower. This trio of little bites is very refreshing, and worth keeping around to enjoy throughout with the rest of the heavier food.- Decoy ChipsThese were a delicious take on chips, which were actually made out of dried fish skin. Kind of like a pescatarian version of chicharrones, these were oily, nice and crispy, and very fun to snack on.- Katz's Pastrami Triangles- Oxtail DumplingsNext up, you get to choose 2 small plates, which is the same selection as the bar menu. In retrospect, maybe we should've gotten something lighter for one of the two, but I don't really regret it as both were incredible. First up was a more bar-friendly version of RedFarm's famous Katz's Pastrami Egg Roll. Instead of the large roll, this consisted of 3 little triangles, which were piping hot, crispy, golden brown delicious, and stuffed with amazing pastrami. These are a definite must.We also got some more fried deliciousness in the form of the excellent Oxtail Dumplings. This plate was served with 4 pieces, which were large and puffy, with quite a bit of air inside and a small piece of juicy oxtail. These were also delicious, but not quite as good as the triangles.- Soft & Crunchy Vegetable Fried RiceThe fried rice at RedFarm is always incredible, and this was no exception. This comes standard as part of the meal, but you can add other varieties or substitute at a surcharge (you can also choose between this and one of the side dishes, which is either Snow Pea Leaves or Asparagus, so the right choice is pretty obvious). Any reasonable carnivore might scoff at this and be tempted to substitute one of the meatier options, but there is no need to, as this is so good it makes you forget there is no meat in it. It's a pretty sizable bowl with tons of different veggies, including some delicious little crispy broccoli florets. This is an awesome complement to the duck.- Whole Peking DuckWhat we all came here for, this is some excellent duck. Sliced up on a platter, with a layer of crispy skin on top and the legs flanking the sides of the plate, it is tough to decide which of the 3 provided sauces is the best to go with it - each of the peanut, hoisin and cranberry are so delicious. It also comes with 10 pancakes, which are also excellent, and are good for making little duck wraps with.Everything we ate was pretty delicious. I feel like it must be compared to the large format duck meal at a Momofuku Ssam Bar though, which I happened to like much more. The duck itself there was much meatier and juicier, but you do get much better sides and other stuff here.This was a fun and delicious experience, but for that amount of money, I would much rather pig out upstairs at RedFarm.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

The oxtail meat inside was very tender.-Seared live scallop, scallop dumpling: nicely seared and very fresh giant scallop with a steamed scallop dumpling. Very good and well worth the additional $.-Soft and crunchy vegetable fried rice: this was ok and didn't feel that there was anything unique about it.-Peking duck: perfectly crisp skin with a subtle sweet taste to it. The meat was easy to eat and moist. This also included 3 sauces, 10 pancakes and 2 very tasty duck soup shots. This is now my gold standard for Peking duck.The cocktails from the cocktail menu were unique but, I found them to be too sweet and not as complex tasting as they sounded.

Ever since Decoy opened their Peking Duck Dinner, every single favorable time slot for a party of four has been taken. My friends and I finally snagged a spot on Friday and it was certainly worth the wait. Since we were a party of four, we ordered the Peking Duck Dinner, which is $65 per person. This includes the duck, four small plates, two main entrees, and one fried rice dish. This may not sound like much, but by the end of the duck and the four plates, we were all stuffed (and we still had the mains and fried rice to go!). Not to mention, we were given complimentary pickled veggie dishes and decoy chips. For our four plates we chose the Katz's Pastrami Triangles, Oxtail Dumplings, Wagyu Short Rib Skewers and the Octopus Salad (new addition). The Pastrami triangles seemed to be all the rave from the Yelp reviews but to me they were just alright. The oxtail dumplings were accompanied by a spicy sauce so I really enjoyed that. The Wagyu short ribs were absolutely delicious. The portion was a bit small but it was grilled to perfection and the marinade couldn't have been paired better. The last appetizer, the octopus salad, was dressed with salmon roe, seaweed salad, cucumbers and brussel sprouts. This dish had the most interesting presentation, as it was served in a small bowl on top of a steaming teapot. The next course was the duck. The duck was served on a tear shaped platter with cucumbers on one end and shallots on the other end. It came with three different sauces - classic hoisin, peanut and cranberry. The pancakes were paper thin and served piping hot in a bamboo steamer basket. The hoisin and peanut sauces were great but the real winner was the cranberry sauce. It made the meal reminiscent of Thanksgiving and really gave an added kick to the perfectly crispy skin.After the duck, our group was ready to call it quits, but we had three more courses coming. For the main entrees, we ordered the Black Sea Bass, Yellow Leek & Black Beans and the Jamaican-Chinese Style Jerk Baby Chicken, Corn & Brussels Sprouts. The sea bass portion was quite small (not that we needed anymore food), but the fish meat was extremely tender. The mushrooms were a great complement. For the chicken, we were served four huge pieces. It was a little dry but the sauce disguised this. Finally, we ended the meal with Crab & Scallop Fried Rice. This required a small substitution fee, but it looked like the best option on the menu. It was absolutely delicious, but unfortunately, since it came at the tail end of the meal, we were unable to eat too much of it which was quite unfortunate. The rice was crispy and the scallop and crab flavors really shone through.Overall, the service was quite good. They really rushed the meal along and there wasn't much wait in between courses. They also do a great job with the reservation system because they're able to sit people down at their reservation times as opposed to making you wait forever even though you had a reserved time.

We came here with my sister (a Peking duck lover as well) and her bf.  I had incredibly high hopes as this place is very expensive for the only option prix fixe.  The dining experience kicked off with fried fish skin I cringed a little bit when they brought it out but it turned out to be amazing!  They then brought out an assortment of picked vegetables, I wasn't a fan but that's probably because I just don't like pickled stuff.  We selected 4 small dishes:  oxtail dumplings, katz pastrami triangles, wagyu short rib skewers and shrimp stuffed peppers.  The oxtail dumplings and wagyu skewers were simply melt in your mouth amazing!!!! The pastrami triangles were very good as well however I wouldn't recommend the shrimp stuffed peppers although good it didn't rival the other appetizers.They then brought out hot duck consommé which I didn't love as it tasted a bit smoky..We were then presented with the beautiful Peking duck and oh man it was amazingly delicious!!!! The pancakes were perfectly thin and just how you want them!  Along with the Peking duck came our side of vegetable fried rice one of the best I've ever had and our 2 additional main dishes the lobster noodles which were phenomenal with actual lobster claws in it and the steak which was one of the absolute best I've had in a very long time.I also need to give due credit to their mixologist who made really amazing drinks for the whole group: the duck fat drink was really cool - check out pic!I highly recommend this restaurant for the best Peking duck you will ever have and an all in amazing culinary experience however cannot give them 5 stars due to the following:-We made our reservation a month in advance yet were placed right by the front door where it was freezing-A big communal table seats everyone. I understand this place is very small but I'm not one for communal tables especially when you are paying top notch restaurant prices-decor: here once again I think this bare bone rustic no thrill decor is out of place for the price you are paying... -charging extra for a few additional pancakes when you are already charging an arm and a leg is inappropriate.  In fact, they should give more pancakes as almost half the duck was left with no pancakes to use so you are forced to just pay for extra pancakes",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

175,WrVRNjvf8yLeF3361qXCxw,Lawrence H.,5.0 star rating,"I believe Decoy is one of the best bars in the city today. Hidden beneath an upscale Chinese restaurant, Decoy is also one of the least known bars in the city. This is fine by me, because I don't have to deal with the multi-hour long waits and crowded shoebox-sized spaces of the other cocktail destinations the city has to offer.Their menu tilts slightly toward Asian drinks, with playfully named cocktails such as the Osakatini (essentially a martini with rice wine), Whaa Gwaan (a spicy but sweet rum drink), or the Mao-chelada (a michelada made with Chinese beer). The menu drinks are amazingly well-executed, balanced, interesting, and delicious, and the bartenders are wizards who are also able to conjure up an off-the-menu drink if you wish.Seating is mostly bar seating or along a long narrow communal table usually reserved for larger dining parties. The food menu is comprised of Chinese ""tapas"" like dumplings, and a heartier Peking duck special (Full disclosure: I've never had this $78 dish, but the staff claims it's the best Peking duck in New York).",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

You need to be sitting down to comprehend what's going on here...This was an experience that any person in New York needs to embark on.I came here with high expectations so I was prepared to be let down. I left feeling the complete opposite. I was more than blown away! The whole experience was surprising, not pretentious, and excellent.The three person dinner included the following-Fish skin chips like pork rinds. Super crunchy, not too salty... The pickled veggies, yuzu mango, olive, and caulifower were really fresh and crisp. Very well done...we were excited for the next course...The second course we got the three sides: oxtail dumpling, katz triangles, and shrimp stuffed pepper. WOW. I had never had any of these dishes before and let me just say, we were completely blown away by what these dishes brought to the table! #OMFGWe were really eating everything up here. I thought the oxtail dumpling was really good but not the caliber of the other two dishes. Next time I would get the soft potato noodle with uni- the table next to us was raving about. Now the main course! The duck was spot on. Good crisp skin and soft duck meat with veggies for crunch, and sauces for specific taste. It was so much good food and we were stuffed. The steak came out with the rice and asparagus... Very succulent juicy meat and we were too full to finish the rice and asparagusOverall it was a hefty price for three but not at all unreasonable.

178,a2ieV-4XLasWvI-1UWzyHg,Lindsey S.,5.0 star rating,"I had been looking forward to trying this place out for some time and most recently I read the ""Where to eat 2015"" piece in NY Mag and again...they were listed! So, with my family in town, I thought this was a perfect opportunity to make a reservation and try their famous Peking Duck. (Yes they only serve twenty-something ducks per night...reservations get priority so be sure to make one!)The space itself is beautifully appointed with one long communal table down the center of the restaurant along with seats at the bar and in the front windows. Located below Red Farm (I have not been) it is partially below street level so just be on the lookout for the Red Farm sign and you'll be in business.We were seated along the communal table essentially 1 party in from the door. On the one wall is a large mural featuring ducks and geese at a long table - a perfect backdrop for our dining experience. Overhead is a long bar with plants, menus and even chopsticks hanging among the lights giving you the feel as though you are in a rustic kitchen with pans hanging overhead. We were a bit late for our reservation with only one of the 4 of us at the table on time. The servers were extremely accommodating and never once made us feel rushed to leave our seats. We had the prix fix duck - which is 1 duck for all of us to share. Included in the $65 price is: 10 pancakes, a sampling of house-made pickled items, crispy chips (ours were perfectly cooked fish skins - branzino to be specific), 4 small plates, a shot of duck consumme per person, 2 main dishes and either 1 fried rice or 1 side. That is an absurd amount of food for $65! I was already impressed.The pickled items we had were: pickled mango, pickled butternut squash, kimchi cucumbers, kimchi cauliflower, pickled Chinese broccoli & okra, pickled shishito peppersFor our small plates we shared: octopus salad with pickled cucumber, Katz' pastrami triangles, oxtail dumplings, foie gras and strawberry tarts (this had an $8 supplement cost).For our mains (of course along with the ridiculously well cooked and flavored duck) we shared: pork ""toro"" with Korean rice cakes, black sea bass with yellow leeks and black beans.For our sides/rice we shared: sauteed snow pea leaves, crab & scallop fried rice. (Note we ordered both a side and a fried rice so we paid extra for the additional item.)The pickled items and the crispy chips (aka fish skins in our case) came out first. The fish skin was a highlight of the meal - I hope this is something they will continue to do. The pickled mango was my favorite of the pickled items. Then came the Katz' triangles which looked like spanicopita triangles but of course are filled with Katz' luxuriously mouth-watering pastrami which was out of this world - and served with a mustard dipping sauce. The oxtail dumplings were next up and those were rich and flavorful and falling-off-the-bone delicious - another meal highlight. Lastly, the foie gras strawberry tarts which are served in tartlett cups in the shape of little ducks. It seemed like a somewhat strange combination but upon eating it, it really works. Try this if you are of the foie gras fan base like I am. The duck was plentiful - well carved with inside pieces, plenty of pieces with skin along with just pieces of skin and the drumsticks. Served with sliced cucumber, scallion, crispy shallots and pickled pearl (?) onions and 3 sauces (peanut, hoisin, cranberry) you could design your own decadent wrap as you pleased. The wraps were also extremely well made (must be in house) and our only complaint was not having more of them.The mains were both very good - the bass was a nice lighter element to help balance our over-the-top starters and the pork ""toro"" came with the Korean rice cakes which had a texture I just adore. The fried rice was wonderfully fluffy - some of the best I have ever had - and the scallop and crab extremely fresh tasting. The pea leaves are my friend's favorite and I have never had them before (though if you smell them, they smell just like snow peas...so you can imagine they taste similar). She was very impressed, so therefore I was, too.All in all, this restaurant had courteous staff who attended us very well (we were there for over 2 hours and as I mentioned were late in sitting down to begin with) and never made us feel like we were overstaying our welcome. The food came out at a decent pace, though initially it felt a bit rushed, we asked them to slow it down and they happily accommodated. The bathroom was clean and boasts one of those Japanese toilets where there is a control panel on the wall with all sorts of options for you to pick from. If you haven't seen one in person yet, be sure to go in even if just to wash your hands and see how technology has evolved. Will I come back to Decoy? Absolutely!

I will not go into each and every dish as they have been discussed multiple times here.  The highlights of the meal include, for one, the Peking duck.  It's not just the perfect duck itself but the entire dish.  The pancakes were perfectly thin and pliable.  There was an ample amount of cucumbers and scallions (uniformly cut which is important), fried shallots (looked good but didn't touch) and three different sauces of which I only tried the hoisin.  I have not had a duck in NYC that rivals this, not even close.  Other highlights were the up charged black truffle studded chicken soup dumplings (excellent, I think worth the up charge) the pork ""toro"" with Korean rice cake main dish (rivaled the duck in terms of flavor and quality but lacked an ample amount of pork.  Really skimpy.), a stir fried lamb and veggies over a home made pita (simply outstanding), and the up charged shrimp and scallop fried rice (texturally a very nice dish but really lacked proper seasoning).  And let's not forget that flavor bomb Duck consume!  Wow!  Or the tremendous pickles and fried fish skin.And finally the service, unlike a past horrendous experience I have had here, was excellent, from the moment we walked in to when we left.

In what used to be a dry cleaners, they were able to skirt around zoning laws to open up quite the sexy cocktail lounge to compliment their famous restaurant fare just one flight of stairs away. One of the only recurring knocks on Red Farm was their extremely intimate seating arrangements and lack of bar space. Now that's a thing of the past as you can pop downstairs to Decoy and enjoy a drink at the bar and even a few familiar Red Farm items that you can order from their scaled down menu. They're pretty adamant that Red Farm and Decoy are two completely different entities, but they're certainly related and there's some nice crossover to fulfill your cravings.In addition to a litany of cocktails to choose from, they have a nice bar bites menu with my favorite being the Katz's pastrami triangles (thing thin-skinned and deep fried spring rolls). They serve full on Katz's pastrami egg rolls upstairs, but this is a take on the original. You can also dive into their peking duck dinner at Decoy. It'll cost you more than a similar BYOB affair in Chinatown, but hey - you're on Hudson Street in the West Village.

Clearly, this place is still getting on solid footing logistics-wise. We ended up getting smooshed among others on the communal table. They were hesitant to move us to the end of the table when we requested it, but we found out later it was because the owner was coming in to dine there!We got the pre-fixe for $65/person for 5 people -- which includes peking duck/wraps, appetizers (4? 5?), entrees (2), and a side of veggie fried rice. Dishes included:1. Peking duck - there is much less meat and a much higher price when you think about the peking duck you get in Chinatown. But, Decoy does a wonderful job of cutting up the duck for you into 3 different duck pieces -- meaty, meaty with fatty skin, crispy skin. It makes it incredibly easy to orchestrate a bite of all these essential peking duck pieces. Instead of a bun, you get a really thin wrap (almost like a tortilla, but softer and chewier) -- I much prefer this, and was how I used to eat duck when my mom brought it home for dinner. The duck also comes with three sauces: hoisin (traditional), sesame (delicious, and my favorite mixed with hoisin!), and cranberry (think thanksgiving!). I loved the twist on traditional duck sauces. 2. Wagyu beef -- incredibly succulent, although nothing out of the ordinary considering this cut of beef.3. Fois gras -- comes with strawberries on top, which sounds horrendous but was actually delicious. The tartness of the strawberries really balances out the fattyness of the fois gras. Was one of the most pleasant surprises of this meal.4. Oxtail dumplings -- good, but I thought the skin was a little thick and too puffy and overpowered the small amount oxtail inside. Didn't taste incredibly different from a fried dumpling, but may be due to the fact that I burned half my tongue biting into it. Careful, it's hot!5. Katz Pastrami Triangles -- the star of appetizers. Please get this -- it's a great riff between a crispy egg roll and another NY favorite. 6. Cocktails -- At $14, they're pretty $$, but their entire menu is wonderful and has a surprising amount of spicy cocktails if you're into that sort of thing (Sriracha bitters, muddled black peppercorn, etc.) The other parts of our meal -- the homemade pickles (pickled cauliflower, pickled olives...pickled everything) -- were tasty, but I wish they hadn't taken them away. I would've loved to eaten them throughout the meal. The fish skin chips were fantastic! We splurged for the seafood fried rice but was thoroughly disappointed, it was definitely vegetable fried rice with some unseasoned white fish thrown in.Overall, Decoy was a good meal, although it's probably too expensive for me to go again.

We ended waiting for an hour. Clearly the staff didn't let the party know that there were incoming reservations waiting for the table. I've never had to wait for more than 15 minutes for the previous party to finish up. We talked to the hostess about our concern, and she said that she'd comp a round of our drinks. After we finally sat down, the waiter only gave us one set of the menu -- the Peking duck set menu, which also has the entrees and appetizers listed with prices. So we thought those were the a la carte items. Turns out, there was a separate a la carte menu, which we weren't presented with. I asked the waiter about ordering a la carte, and he curtly said that he'd have to check with management. Uhh...wtf #2. So shady. I won't go into details about the food because all the dishes we ordered were pretty mediocre (sweet potato noodles with uni, sea bass, foie gras strawberry tart (ick), Peking duck.

205,tQxPH16VO6G3ZJKZhfmkhw,Ruchu T.,5.0 star rating,"This is perhaps one of the most amazing meals I've had in a very long time. The restaurant's concept is quite unique but is still true to it's Chinese roots. The food it serves remind me of authentic foods in China and even resembling some of my mom's Cantonese style of cooking!My friend reserved the dinner for the duck course. I was here with a party of four and was promptly seated. The waiter went over some of the options on the menu and how the dinner will be served. Before the small dishes arrived, we were served fried fish skins and an assortment of pickled fruits and vegetables. The fish skin was very crispy and thin. It was lightly salted and served with a spicy mayo sauce. The pickled veggies were all great, my favorite was the Chinese broccoli. After these were served, we all had a ""shot"" of duck consomme which basically is reduced duck soup. I think this gives the diner a taste of what's to come. The consomme was really rich and full of roast duck flavors.We chose to start with the ox tail dumplings, oysters, foie gras, and wagyu beef. The ox tail dumplings were crispy and very hot and soft on the inside. The ox tail was grounded very finely and was seasoned perfectly. The oysters were served raw but was seasoned in some type of citrus liquid. The oysters were decently sized and was fresh. The foie gras was served on strawberry tart. It was delicious when eaten all together. Lastly, the beef was seasoned and served similar to Korean bulgogi with a side of kimchi. The beef was very tender something you can't find with meaty cuts of beef. The main dish of course was the Peking duck. It was amazing to see how thin and crispy the skin was. The chefs did an amazing job! Not only was it cooked perfectly, it was cut and served with precision. Each piece of skin was thin but contained a thin layer of fat that's bursting with flavor with every bite. The skin was phenomenal! The duck was served with sliced leeks, cucumber strips, pancakes, and three sauces. I haven't had Peking duck in many years, the last time I had it was actually in Beijing. This definitely can compare, if not better!At this point, we were also served black sea bass stir fried with snap peas, mushrooms, leeks, and a few other veggies. The sauce can be described as something similar to what you may find in a seafood pan fried noodle dish but was lighter and less thick. The sauce went very well with the ingredients nevertheless. The sea bass was soft and cooked beautifully. Sweet and meaty flesh. After all this, we were served their steak special. It was a 40-day dry aged strip steak. Oh man was this good! Cooked to a near perfect medium-rare and the seasoning was spot on. Salty with a crispy crust on the outside but very juicy on the inside. This is perhaps one of the best steaks I've had!  While we were indulging on the duck, sea bass, and steak, the ""two shrimp"" fried rice was served as well. The fried rice was very delicious. The dried shell on shrimp within the rice gave the dish a unique flavor and crunch. Fried rice is a rather simple dish, but this was very innovative way to change things up. The second shrimp were large prawns that were grilled and seasoned lightly with a hint of sweetness.We were all stuffed at this point and had a few boxes of food to take home. It was an exceptional dinner with exceptional food and service. Will definitely return if I visit NYC again!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I have life threatening allergies to fish and nuts and notified the staff ahead of time when making the reservation. Even offered to review the menu on the phone and was assured there was no need. I am used to navigating restaurants carefully. When the wait person brought out the first dish, a dish of crispy fried fish skin, I assumed it was a one time error and let it go. But when I then inquired about the ingredients in the second dish of pickled foods and discovered they were made with fish sauce it was time to be alert. I was only trying to be sure that I was safe and not going to be leaving in an ambulance, the wait person responded with attitude and a tone that was offensive and posed a serious threat to my health. Her exact words were ""we deal with this every day, you have nothing to worry about!"" Apparently they don't deal with this carefully enough - because as it turns out, over the next ten minutes they required us to change nearly every dish we ordered. They even revealed that at least one VEGETARIAN dish had fish (bonito flakes) in it. We had to have a chat with the manager and literally read the labels on every product used in the preparation of our foods in order to feel completely satisfied that the staff serving the food knew what they were talking about. We had to make substitutions to our menu to avoid the foods that we couldn't have at the table and then saw they had the nerve to charge us extra for those items as added items on our bill. So sloppy, Decoy. And so rude. The food is tasty. But attention to the customer really needs work. We will never return.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

We started Decoy Chips which was a great way to begin the experience since you don't think about eating fried fish skin. Next up were 5 vinegared cups of cucumbers, mango, green peppers, butternut squash and cauliflower. Each cup was completely different which made it that much better. After that were the appetizers which included the Katz's Pastrami Triangles which melted in my mouth, Oxtail Dumplings which had a great fried crunch and the Crunchy Vegetable & Peanut Dumplings were fantastic when paired together. The Peking Duck with Duck Consomme Shots, 10 Pancakes, & 3 Sauces were served next. The duck and consommé shots were by far the star of the show. The duck was cooked to perfection, was juicy and savory while the consommé flavor was perfect leaving me wanting a pint instead of a shot. Then the entrée arrived which was the Sauteed Diced Lamb with Chinese Broccoli and Pickled Shallots and it did not disappoint. It was not overcooked and all the ingredients worked together. Our side was Sautéed Snow Pea Leaves which were a lot better than I expected. The service was spectacular from the host, to waitress and even the servers.

215,wGuMKQmLT3Z7PAWT6PpiEg,Angela W.,4.0 star rating,"Decoy had been on my list for a longggg time, but I only managed to get a reservation recently.  This is definitely a spot that you need to book about a month in advance if you plan on eating over the weekend at a normal (read: 7-9PM) time slot.I came on a double date, and the four of us opted for the prix-fixe menu at $65 a head.  This may seem kind of steep for Peking Duck, but it actually comes with a TON of food.  Specifically, among the four of us, we shared four appetizers, one duck, two entrees, and a fried rice dish.  We came hungry but were not able to finish the rice at the end.They start with some chips and picked veggies on the house in lieu of bread and butter, and then move quickly into appetizers.  I would definitely get the Oxtail Dumplings again, but I think the Pastrami Triangles are actually a pass.  The Octopus Salad came in a little steaming pot which was so cute!Duck was delicious, and very well cut.  The skin was just crispy enough, and there wasn't a ton of fat either.  They provide three sauces - cranberry, hoisin, and peanut, so it is a bit of a twist on your traditional Peking duck.  Only downside is they gave us 10 pancakes, which is kind of an odd number for 4 people...and it costs to get additional ones.  Minus one star since at Cosme, we were given free tacos for our Duck Carnitas after we blew threw our first batch.Main entrees were the Black Sea Bass and Jamaican-Chinese Chicken.  Sea bass was quite good, and very asian-style with tender steamed veggies.  The chicken was just okay, but if you're coming as four dudes, you wont be disappointed since portions were HUGE.  They came on top a bed of noodles as well.  We ended up paying a $7 supplement to get the Crab and Scallop Fried rice (Veggie was the non supplement choice), and are glad we did.  No dessert since we were STUFFED but they had a dessert menu for those who still want it. It was an enjoyable meal, but on the pricier side for Chinese food, so I won't be making this my go-to place for Peking Duck.  However, it's good for when you want a Western twist on Asian fare, and definitely a great date spot (which isn't the case for most large Chinese restaurants).",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"
216,OF05Kg5zeCM1tIGW2dS5cw,Aggie H.,4.0 star rating,"We ordered the peking duck set menu for $65pp. I dont remember every single dish we ordered but these are the ones that I really loved- * Decoy chips: reminded me of pork rinds but with fish skin. They were incredibly addicting, especially with the sauce on the side, which reminded me of soybean paste mixed with other flavors. * Octopus with fish roe: the food is presented on top of a steaming tea kettle. The roe really complemented the flavors of the octopus! * Katz pastrami: I wasn't really sure how this was asian fusion aside from the sauce, which is the same as the one served with the decoy chips. It was reminiscent of an empanada to me, however it was really good too. * Strawberry duck tart?: I dont know the official name of this but it looked cuter than it tasted. It was decorated into the shape of a turkey, which made us all ooh and ahh, but I found it hard to eat and I didn't enjoy the sweetness of the strawberry with the duck. * Peking duck: As everyone else and their mom stated, this is a must order! The meat was very tender and the skin remained nice and crisp. It's served with pancakes, 3 sauces (hoisin & cranberry) and scallions, cucumber, & deep fried scallions on the side. * Ribeye steak: So juicy and flavorful, another must order in my book! * Pork with korean rice cake (dduk): I loved the tenderness and taste of the pork but did not really like the dduk. But then again, I only really like dduk in ddukbokki.* Fried rice: I did not find this dish to be particularly remarkable, except that it had goji berries in it. * Lobster with noodle: While I only had a nibble of this dish, I also did not think this was memorable. However, everyone else really seemed to like this!I am probably forgetting some other items but either I did not try them or didn't think they were that great. But overall, the food was really delicious albeit super salty for me. I am not typically fond of Asian fusion (cough cough Kittychai) since I feel like it's food with an identity crisis.

Given the tight seating - some bar seating, a couple (literally) of 2-person seats near the entrance, and one big communal table - you definitely want to make a reservation, especially on the weekends. Weekday availability is lighter, at least from what I've noticed on the website, so you could pull a mid-week walk-in if you're feeling adventurous. Getting seated was straightforward, and service once the meal started was okay. It was a bit iffy at first - a long time taking our order, and then an inordinately long time preparing the cocktails (I think the bartender forgot, or our order wasn't placed properly) - but it picked up after that.The cocktails here are done very well, from both a flavor perspective (I really liked mine, which had the duck fat-infused whiskey) and an aesthetic standpoint (the fizz on top is in the shape of a duck...maybe why it took so long). The beer list - less impressive; when the most appealing option is Peak Organic IPA, it feels like there wasn't as much consideration but into the beer selection. For the food, we had the tasting menu as we were a party large (or small enough? I forget the requirement) to warrant it. You start out with a host of pickled vegetables, all of which are pretty solid. My personal favorite was the sliced green peppers dipped in duck broth, which cut the edge off the peppers while adding a bit of flavorful depth from the broth. We also had the fish skin chips as well, which were quite good, if a bit hard to handle (the veggies kept falling off).We started getting into the thick of the meal after that, starting with our four appetizers. The clams were pretty solid Kumamotos, which is a nice, clean, slightly sweet start to a meal that generally didn't tend towards those descriptors. The oxtail dumplings were very solid well, with the meat cooked just the right amount and marinating in the rich broth inside the dumpling. The foie gras tarts had to be the highlight though; it reminded me of torchons I've had with rich fruit, and the strawberry pairing with the slices of foie gras were just divine - it's hard to beat the rich fattiness of the foie with fruit pairings. After that, it was on to the shots of consomme (a nice palette cleanser / preparation for the rest of the meal) and the duck, which is easily the best Peking-style duck I've had in NYC. Perfectly cooked, very crispy skin that maintains the great flavor of the duck, and very succulent cuts of meat made it a treat all around. As for the dipping sauces - I preferred the hoisin by a long shot; I appreciate the others, but it seems more like a nod to pan-Asian tastes (peanut sauce) and American Thanksgiving preferences (cranberry sauce)...or maybe I'm just a traditionalist when it comes to this! The main plates and the rice came out shortly thereafter...we stuck with the vegetarian fried rice, which was executed really well and was plenty hearty enough that no meat was no issue. While the ribeye has a supplement on the prix fixe, it was definitely worth it - cooked to medium rare perfection, which I oftentimes feel is undercooked - it had so much flavor, and such a rich marinade, that it is definitely one of the best steaks I've had in some time. The sea bass (our other main) was pretty solid, very well prepared and well-flavored, but it wasn't as memorable as the steak. In the end, we passed on dessert as nothing quite piqued our interest.All in all, this was a very pleasing dining experience. The duck was great, and nothing really struck a bad chord with regards to taste or preparation. It's a lot of food - so don't come on a half-filled stomach - and the service may come off as a bit inattentive at first, but it really is a very enjoyable experience. With a rustic, farmhouse feel that is below street level, it's easy to lose yourself in the food and good conversation with friends.

Except for the bar and one small table, the whole restaurant only has a long table that seats about 20 people, 10 on each side. I can see the appeal for the restaurant owner: it allows for maybe 50% more customers. Yet for us this communal-style table leaves almost no space for elbow or privacy.Before the dinner, we could smell every dish enjoyed by our neighbors. They are literally within our reach. Over the dinner, I was forced to learn that the guy next to me has a really wealthy friend who is an art dealer and how astonished he felt when he visited his friend's place and saw all these wonderful art pieces.I would understand all this crowdedness if they were just trying to make more money (plenty of restaurants do that). But they are not. When I explained my frustration to two different hostess, both kindly and proudly pointed out that this is their style. It's called the ""communal style"".

There's definitely something to be said for consistency. As a tip, I would suggest sitting at the bar, especially if you're just two people. I prefer it to the communal table. To be honest, I don't love Red Farm, Decoy's sister restaurant, but here's, it's ALL ABOUT THE DUCK so make sure you do the duck tasting. I love duck--in all forms--and Peking duck is by far one of my favorites. My mom makes it really well and I've been to some pretty amazing Peking duck places in Beijing and Shanghai but I have to say, Decoy really takes the cake. (Don't tell mom i said that.) It's just cooked to perfection. Juicy. Flavorful. Not fatty or oily. And of course, the crispy skin--by far the best part. Since you come here for the duck, it's a given that the duck is amazing so let's talk side dishes. Bar Snacks (favorites on the top)- Oxtail Dumplings: This is my favorite and I order it every time. The skin of the dumpling is slightly crunchy, like a batter, and the inside is delicious, tender meat--definitely nothing like a traditional Chinese dumpling. It's similar in flavor to the Katz's Pastrami (but better) so I wouldn't recommending getting both. - Grilled Duck & Litchi: If you're wondering if it's too much duck to get this and the duck, stop. Just do it. It's never too much duck and this is one of the best sides. - Potato noodles with with Uni: Splurge and add the uni on top--it really makes the dish. Light and delightful. - Sauteed Snow Pea Leaves: really nice side to have to balance out all the meat. it's super fresh and tastes like Spring. - Katz's Pastrami Triangles: crispy, fatty, delicious - Foie Gras & Strawberry Tarts: This was probably my least favorite, which was a surprise considering I love Foie Gras. I didn't love the sweetness of itMain Dish- Black Sea Bass: I wasn't expecting too much from this dish but it really blew me away. It was beautifully done both in flavor, execution, and presentation. Drinks:- Sitting Down for Dinner: For the whiskey lovers, go with the Sitting Down for Dinner. It's smokey and delightful--how can it not be if the liquor has been infused with duck fat? Plus they make a cute duck design with red wine and froth on top- Smoke and Spice: Spunky drink with a nice spicy kick that comes in a pineapple. What's not fun about that? Everything was delicious but I think the most impressive is actually the duck consomme shots that come w the duck tasting.

I have one note though. You pay a prix fix menu of 65$ but some plates have extra fees.So we ended up paying $110 per person because of 2 glasses of wine and a rice that was half-included in the prix fix and half you had to pay for. So, my point is, that this is an extremely expensive restaurant.. In the end the whole experience was great! We will be definitely going back!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

I should note, I've never had Peking Duck before, but heard that this was the spot for it, so we made a reservation earlier in the week for a Friday night.For one, everyone we interacted with that night was super helpful, and we were seated immediately upon entering (it's definitely a small space, but nothing New Yorkers haven't seen before). We chose a seat at the bar (I could see how sitting with just one other person at the communal table could be weird though - go for the bar seating if you can), and ordered a few different items, which came out quickly and efficiently post-drink orders (the waitress was adept at both directing us to some great selections and accommodating my shellfish allergy, which is often difficult in an Asian-inspired restaurant). We got the Vegetable/Peanut dumplings (incredible) alongside the Pastrami Squares (also incredible). There were some (homemade) pickles, a consommé shot for each of us, and some tasty vegetable fried rice mixed in, but the duck was obviously the star of the show. As noted above, I've had duck, but never in this traditional iteration, and left extremely pleased (and full). The accoutrements are well thought out (and I found out, with a nod to tradition), the duck was cooked perfectly (hashtag duck skin, ya heard?), and the portion sizes were fairly generous. It's not cheap (it'll run you about $100/person with a drink), but definitely worth it for a great night out, or just a really incredible meal.",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"

So I ordered 3 Prix Fixe at $65 each and additional 3 Main dishes from $39-49 each, two appetizers at $18-22 each and all prix fixe dishes asked and paid for upgrades including Uni for $18 extra. Manager came over condescendingly saying he could not understand my orders as relayed by our server Joe. I explained. Well, he said huffed up, we do not understand who gets the duck dinners. I said, we like family style. He insisted, this is a family style service. So I said it should not be a problem! Our server Joe tried the entire evening to make up for the huffy manager. Joe went over and beyond. At the end, I spent $110 per person while the manager insisted I order $65 per person. Go figure?! If it were not for the server's overcompensating kindness, this would be a different review (here and elsewhere). When saying goodbye, it would have been really great if the manager just apologized...for the gesture. But that would be asking too much.

A few other seats tucked away in the windows. Low lighting, lots of wood. It almost felt like the bow of a pirate ship. We ordered the duck prix fix for 2 people at $65 per person. A few amuse bouche apps included pickled veggies & fruit and crispy fish skin chips which were both delicious. To our disappointment they had just run out of the grilled wagyu beef starter (the problem with being seated immediately next to people who ordered 45 minutes earlier), so we tried the octopus salad & crunchy veggie/peanut dumplings. * octopus salad was very good; the ratio of octopus to pickled cucumber was not great. As we had literally just eaten pickled cucumbers for the amuse bouche we had a chopstick fight over the pieces of octo... I, of course, won* crunchy dumpling weren't very crunchy & they didn't have a lot of peanuts. They were pretty good and I enjoyed the texture of the water chestnuts in them, but I don't think they were packed with as much flavour as I would have hoped. I wish the pickled starters didn't come on a massive piece of wood. Communal tables encourage the runners to clear the tables often & it would have been nice to keep the pickled starters throughout the meal. The duck was very good but I wouldn't say it was exceptional. I liked the way they presented it; grouped together were skin, fatty pieces & leaner meat. The sauces were nice that they paired together. The shot of consommé was also really yummy. Everything together was very pleasing, but there was so much, and we were too full for desert. The service was good. At first I felt like the price was high, but after seeing how much food they put out I don't think that as much.

Only went with 1 other person, so we got 2 small plates,  the duck, and a fried rice dish (all part of the pre fixe menu). The small plates were quite good, with the oxtail dumplings being particularly interesting. Always cool to see a twist on dumplings. They also served us ""chips"", which were breaded and fried fish skins. They were well seasoned and crispy, and quite unique.The duck itself was very good, the best I have had outside of Asia. Being new to NYC, I am not entirely sure how it compares to other options, but the skin was crisp, the meat tender. I actually prefer the pancake style wrapper to buns, and Decoy serves the pancakes. They also offer 3 sauces, but I only found one to be any good (hoisen) while the others just didn't work for me (peanut = too oily, cranberry = too sweet, and just plain weird). That is a minor knock though, and overall it was some top notch peking duck.Some might say that $65/person is pricey for peking duck, but you get a lot more than just the duck here, especially if you come with a bigger group. The portions are quite large as well, I have at least one meal of fried rice and leftover duck in the fridge. In addition, it is a cool atmosphere, the cocktails were innovative and tasty, and the location is great for a walk pre/post dinner. Will certainly look to try other peking duck options in NYC, but this was a great start!Also, one note: the seating is communal, and it is somewhat close quarters, especially given the large platters for the duck.

It maybe not good enough to compete with the ones in China, but it's good enough for you to impress your date. The uni noodle is also a lovely highlight.

This was place #3, and it was maybe the worst, so strike 3 for trying new places.We ordered 2 of their specialty cocktails. They weren't bad by any means. One (cant recall the name but it had tequila and grapefruit) was pretty decent while the other (pepper and vodka ) was ok but they literally fill their martinis halfway so theyre like a shot. Yeah, maybe the same amount of liquor but seeing a martini halfway filled is just kind of angering when paying $14.We ordered the shishito peppers stuffed with shrimp, which was the primary reason we came as we love shishito peppers. Well, they forgot to put them into the computer even with a fairly empty bar so after our drinks were done we reminded them and waited for them to come out. Low and behold, 4 lone peppers for $14 AND, WORST of all, they were FRIED. Why would shishito peppers stuffed with shrimp ever be fried? you can fry a tennis shoe and it will taste good, so you pay a premium for these stuffed shrimp peppers but all you taste is batter...about 6 bites of batter for $14. When the bartender, who forgot to put the order in, asked how we liked them, we said that we wouldn't have ordered had we know they were fried - his reply was that we should expect a Chinese restaurant to serve everything fried.

This was very good duck but sorry, I can get a similar version (carved table-side) for half the price at my beloved Chinese spot located in a strip mall outside the DC area. Don't get me wrong, Decoy's Peking duck was very delicious, just not worth the price.2. Crab & Scallop Fried Rice: read mixed reviews about this dish but I ADORED it; the rice was perfectly cooked and the asparagus added a nice delicate crunch.3. Assortment of Pickles and Cold Veggie Bites: everything was refreshing, clean, and crunchy!4. Fish skin chips: sounds strange but it's quite addictive with the crispy skin and slightly oily taste.5. Main dishes of Sea Bass and Aged Strip Steak: both good but not really memorable.6. ""Dim Sum style"" small plates of Katz's Pastrami Triangles, Oxtail Dumplings, Shrimp and Snowpea Dumplings, and Vegetable Dumplings: all were okay, nothing blew our minds.Overall, the meal was tasty (the server was SUPER slow though) and yes, you get a ton of food for the price but to be honest, it was such an overwhelming amount of food for 4 people that it was hard to savor everything. Leftovers is obviously not a bad thing, but I would have preferred fewer plates of really good food than a ton of food I can't finish/enjoy; I would have been happy with only dishes #1-#4 (see above).This is a tiny restaurant but I really do think for the prix-fixe meal, it's best to roll with 5-7 people so everyone can have a few bites of everything without feeling over-stuffed.

Before we left the apartment, we charged up the vaporizer and did a balloon. Both of us were in a happy mood, quite giddy. She'd never had duck before. I've had duck before at Mercer Kitchen, (which is awesome, by the way - Duck a l'Orange.) But, I've never tried Peking Duck. When you get there, the place is small, dimly lit, and the music they play is excellent. On this particular night when we were there, there was a nice array of old-school hip hop playing. The service is amazing - quite attentive. We were both looking at the menu. I don't know how the hell I missed this, but we were lead to believe the that duck dinner for two, with appetizer plates included, was all together $65. My girlfriend insists that the menu never details the price of the duck dinner for two, and considers it a deceptive omission - I blamed my oversight on being stoned at the time. But, when we got the bill, I was shocked. When I inquired, I was informed that it is $65 per person, not for the entire meal. This place will clean out your pockets, but the food is amazing. We obviously came for the duck, which was prepared perfectly. I had the sea urchin as well, which was super fresh and delicious. One thing I've never tried before but was always curious about was the shrimp fried rice, which is cooked with baby shrimp with the shell still on. I've only seen this on TV, on Anthony Bourdain's ""Parts Unknown,"" and when I've seen it I've always said, ""Yuck."" But, when you try it, you'll say, ""Mmmm!"" Quite possibly the best shrimp fried rice I've had the pleasure of eating. The bathroom is super-cool, with one of those Totto toilets from Japan. One word of advice to men who use the bathroom; there is only one bathroom in this place, so please excersize some decorum, and do not urinate all over the seat! There is a panel against the wall with detailed buttons you can push to lift the seat. Please don't be lazy, and take the time to look at the panel on the right hand side of the toilet as you're standing in front of it. Unfortunately, the night I went, there was a gentleman in front of me who went in, and decided to decorate the seat. There was a woman waiting to use the bathroom right after me, and I did not want her to think it was me, so I took the initiative and wiped down the seat with some soap and water. Keep in mind, this is a $2,500 toilet - please treat it as such. I would definitely go here again when I'm in the mood for duck. It really is that good! P.S. Don't go here for the desserts.

Of course the main attraction is the duck, but the meal includes so much more: 4 small dishes, 3 entrees, a side, and a rice dish--not to mention a massive plate of pickled veggies and a huge plate of crispy fish skin (think pork rinds of the sea.) We started with cocktails. The two I tried--one tequila-based and one whiskey-based. Both were delicious. The pickles that came to the table at the start of the meal are great. Six varieties including Chinese greens, olives stuffed with cornichon in soy sauce, mangos in a mustard sauce, and kimchi cauliflower. All were very good. The crisp fish skins were also good--very light and crunchy.For our small plates we got the ox tail dumplings,  pastrami triangles, foie gras with strawberries, and the shrimp and snow pea dumplings.  I enjoyed all of them--great flavors, some nice twists on familiar flavors. We ordered the steak, lobster, and jerk chicken for our entrees. Again, all were tasty. (We appreciated that our waiter steered us away from an entree that he thought wasn't great.) Of course, the other main dish was the duck. The meat was very tender and not at all dry and the skin was nice and crispy! I really like the thin pancakes. The twist here are the variety of sauces offered with the duck, although most of us agreed that hoisin was the way to go.We got the snow pea leaves as the side and the two shrimp fried rice. Snow pea leaves are my favorite and pretty difficult to screw up. The rice was pretty good, although maybe a little fishy for some palates since they use the small dried shrimp.As much as I enjoyed this meal, I think it could be smaller and a little less expensive. Our group got some of the dishes that required a supplemental charge, but the point is that it was too much food. I know this isn't an everyday meal, but it's not like it's a fancy special occasion restaurant either. I would be more inclined to come back if the dinner were two dishes lighter and $25 cheaper.It's too bad that you can't order the duck alone.

Each dish came right on time and nothing was rushed nor delayed. Literally, everything was perfect and it was our first ""perfect"" dinner date. My favorite dish was the oxtail dumplings and the fish skin chips. The oxtail was flavorful and nicely marinated so the sauce wasn't really necessary but oh my...the spicy sauce for the fish chips were so damn good. It complimented the chips very well. I was hesitant to try the fish skin chips because I was afraid it would be too fishy but it's not at all! It tasted like bacon to me...yum!!I also got the kumamoto oysters for my second small plate and that was very delicious as well. The caviar on top was very innovative and gave the oyster a nice flavor. Now, my favorite part of the meal was the peking duck...the skin was perfectly cooked with a slight crunch and the meat was so tender and juicy.

Peking duck is surely expensive, but this is the SAME exact instance of terrible pricing as Red Farm-- where they serve very little food, that is, ""Asian fusion food"" catered to white people and that doesn't impress anyone Asian. I hate that. I really, really, really hate that. And I find it insulting that the owners of Red Farm felt that their overpriced west village escapade was worth reinvention in the form of Peking Duck.

I sat in the first seat along the wall and had to stand up every time someone wanted to get in and out of their seat. It was worse than sitting in an aisle seat at baseball game. Next, every time the door opened to the restaurant a blast of cold air would hit you. We literally needed our winter jackets on the whole time. What's worse, most of this was caused by employees going out for cigarette breaks. The food - the food was good and plentiful given the hefty price paid. The duck was excellent. So were the pastrami triangles and oxtail dumplings. The sweet and sour shrimp was gross. The cocktails were good but small.

From the moment I walked it I could smell the mixtures of flavors.  This is a small restaurant that is great for a celebration or gathering of old friends.  The family style benches and meal really fosters conversation amongst the different parties about the meal which I loved as I already know what I will be trying on my next visit. The Peking Duck, Wagyu Short Rib Skewers, Black Sea Bass, & Rib Eye Steak were all mouthwatering and utterly amazing.  Each dish was flavorful and most importantly filling, I left feeling full and as though every dollar I spent was worth it.  Enjoy the experience that is Decoy!",Decoy,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Chinese,, Bars"
