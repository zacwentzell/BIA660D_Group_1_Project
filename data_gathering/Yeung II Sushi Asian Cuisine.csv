This was definitely way too much food for two people but we were starving when we ordered. The kani salad wasn't anything special. It comes with apples, which I thought was a little weird so I just told them to leave it out. The pizza was a nice appetizer. It has spicy tuna, avocado, and fish roe on top of a crispy pancake. I would order this again. The sushi boat came with 18 pieces of Sushi, 12 pieces of sashimi, and two special rolls (they only give you an option of four to choose from). Again, not the best quality but not the worst either. I ate some of the leftover pieces the next day and it was still surprisingly pretty good.

Dumplings were honestly some of the best I've ever had. Pork filling was tender and fresh. The reason I gave this place only 2 stars is the service. Our server came up to us twice to ask for the check within a five minute period. We were having conversation and didn't have it ready immediately, but I think it's really rude to rush customers like that. It was 8pm so they definitely weren't about to close.

After we ate the seaweed salad, they brought the other one out and it was literally, a seaweed salad with a few baby octupi on top. Why would we want two of the same thing? The waitress didn't seem to understand English too well so we just gave in. Then I ordered the tofu ramen and it came out as basically a big bowl of Thai coconut curry tofu soup. When I asked the waitress if they brought the right dish, she said yes. I said but there's curry in this? She said there's no curry in it. Again the dish was good but not what I wanted.

I haven't had a great experience.  The sushi at Robongi is very good, but then again, my bf and I came here on Friday around 8:30... and we didn't have sushi.  That's supposed to be the best thing here- not really the Pan Asian stuff, and surely not the Thai food (so I hear). We were craving just Chinese, so that's what we had, my bf: the chicken and broccoli, which he said was run of the mill. He's had better, and he's had worst. The portion was big. I had the Spicy Garlic Chicken- which was really not spicy garlic.  It wasn't garlicky and szechuan style at all, it was like a sweet, tangy General Tso sauce over sauteed chicken- sort of like a chicken and brocc, except for a difference in sauce.  We could choose between white and brown rice. To top off our Chinese night, we started off with the chicken wings... yes like the fried take out kind.   Those were pretty good, and my bf got a wonton soup which he said was fine albeit strange with lettuce. All in all, cheap at $13 a pop, and BYO.  The service was a bit slow, and I think I would come back merely on the fact that it's Asian uptown.  I guess I'd come back for the sushi for sure, and stick to the takeout hole in the wall Chinese for Chinese.",Yeung II Sushi Asian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Pan, Asian"

99,9uHQ08toZpcogiMv2ro3hQ,Ari F.,5.0 star rating,"I have two long-held beliefs regarding Chinese food: The first is that Chinese food must be greasy to be delicious. The second is that if it's from a combo restaurant (e.g. Chinese-Japanese), the food won't match up to dedicated Chinese spots. I'm pleased to report that Yeung II has shattered my reality. Yeung's food is amazing without the insane amounts of grease, and their Chinese is some of the best I've had despite being from a combo restaurant. Even better: Their lunch deals are amazing. For $6.25 you can get pretty much any Chinese dish on the menu with (non-greasy) pork fried rice and a soup. I order several at a time and keep them in my fridge. Everything I've tried thus far has been great. Full disclosure: This place is not universally loved. My garage attendant complained that the rice wasn't true pork-fried rice: it doesn't seem fried. Also, because Yeung II is a restaurant (rather than a dedicated take-out) their non-lunch prices are slightly higher than regular Chinese take-out prices.",Yeung II Sushi Asian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Pan, Asian"

Lacked spicy mayo and sesame seeds. Basically a pretty poor attempt at a simple salad. They did however redeem themselves with the Chili Chicken. All my friends loved the undercover spiciness of the dish. But the real flavor was in the chopped peppers and onions that mixed so nicely into the brown rice. The perfect bite had a little of everything on it. The only knock on this place was the service. It took 10 minutes to get us menus (because they ran out of menus for some reason).

153,hwdZJf9SSEVxMKeeBZRPHw,Rebecca P.,3.0 star rating,"I'm basing my review on delivery (I have never eaten in the restaurant, and probably never will thanks to the rapidity/ease of delivery).For one, this place is FAST. Granted, I live about a three minute walk from here, but I have ordered from other similarly close places and this one has had the fastest delivery. Thus, if you feel yourself spiraling into hypoglycemic disaster, put this place on your speed dial (or on your Seamless Web queue).The delivery people are also very friendly, which is a major plus. When you're inviting strangers into your stairwell, it is nice when they seam nice/not sketchy. Maybe that's just me...In terms of food, it is fresh and good. I have tried the sushi and sashimi from here. It is solid, though to be honest, I do think Robongi is stronger in this arena based on quality and portion size (portions are kind of measely here).",Yeung II Sushi Asian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Pan, Asian"

Went to reheat the food, but after one bite, it was clear the shrimp on my dish was past its sell by date - it was so rotten that it actually stunk up our entire apartment.We called the restaurant and explained the above.  After talking with several different people, we explained the situation to the ""manager"" and he requested to come pick the food up at our home.  Though we thought this was extremely strange, we agreed that he was welcome to come pick the food up and that we would like a refund. A few moments later, the ""manager"" showed up at our door and demanded that we open up each food container.  He then proceeded to argue very loudly with my husband in our hallway, saying that it wasn't his fault that the food was cold and questioning whether the shrimp was bad.  Repeatedly, we explained that all we wanted was for him to indicate whether he was going to issue a refund.  It got to a point where we just told him to leave.  At that point, he says ""Deal with Seamless""...TAKES THE BAG OF FOOD...and LEAVES.  $30 later, we are starving and pissed.Needless to say, we will not be ordering from here again and suggest that you don't either.  We have lodged a formal complaint with Seamless (the customer service person was excellent and it seems they will take care of it).Full disclosure - we have only ordered from here once before, but ordered sushi (rather than Chinese, as we did this time).  The sushi was just okay...but the manager didn't show up at our home that time.",Yeung II Sushi Asian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Pan, Asian"

172,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,4.0 star rating,"Like the stars in the sky or the grains of sand in on the beach, the number of Chinese restaurants in Hoboken is innumerable. However, like all types of cuisine, Stevens students are prone sticking to what they know and never branching out. I have been guilty of this in the past, but as my tastes developed, I am beginning to really enjoy what Hoboken has to offer. Too bad it took me 4 years to figure that out. In my time here, I have never ventured too far north of 10th street to ""Uptown Hoboken."" I sometimes even forget that part of our city exists. However, this week I was fortunate enough to find a surprising Asian restaurant that delivers both in quality and price. When I walked past Yeung II, I immediately thought ""Where's Yeung I?"" I thought it looked like a relatively nice place, but the lunch special sign immediately drew me in. I had gone at an odd time, around 3pm, so I didn't find it odd that we were the only ones there. But even though we were the only customers, the service was not as attentive as I would expect. I also found it odd that they switched the nice cloth napkins for some paper ones, but I guess if I want the 5 star treatment that I'd have to come for dinner. The inside of the restaurant was clean and simple. They had an LCD TV over the sushi bar playing sports center, and an interesting music selection. I don't know if it's just me, but I thought it was a bit out of place for an Asian restaurant to play a collection of 90s pop star hits, including Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and 98 Degrees. However, I enjoyed the music so I let it slide (judge me). Their lunch special was very well priced and offered a good variety to satiate all types of taste. For starters, I once again picked out my favorite appetizer, fried calamari. Unlike other calamari dishes, Yeung's was lightly fried and had more of a tempura texture and taste, and when paired with the sweet and tangy sauce was very delicious. It definitely passed my high standards for calamari. For the main courses, I had ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which came with shumai, a California roll, rice, soup, and salad. The box was a great value, but the beef was tougher than I could let go. I also ordered their Singapore rice noodles which turned out to be one of my favorite dishes. Also known for their sushi, I tried their spicy crunchy tuna and salmon, eel avocado, and their shrimp tempura rolls. While their lunch special was very cheap, the rolls were smaller than average.  One surprising standout of the meal was the hot and sour soup, which was one of the best that I've had in Hoboken. For desert, we shared green tea mochi and fried ice cream. The mochi was pretty much what you could get at the store, but I liked it better than the fried ice cream, which was more doughy than crispy. We also found it odd that they used lettuce as a decoration on their ice cream deserts, but it sure was colorful.Located between 11th and 12th St on Washington Ave, it is just far enough from Stevens that you probably have to think twice about whether you want to walk that far, especially in the changing weather. However, if you muster up the energy to take a trip and the courage to try something new, you'll find yourself handsomely rewarded at YeungII.",Yeung II Sushi Asian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars,, Pan, Asian"
