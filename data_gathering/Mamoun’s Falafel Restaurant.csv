I don't mind paying more price but at least don't make my sandwich smaller and please don't over fill it with lettuce. I have travelled numerous times to hoboken just to have falafel sandwich at this place and my heart breaks now to see my sandwich smaller and overfilled with lettuce.

I order the same thing every time, tabbouleh, baba, feta sandwich- hold the tahini. The last two times they barley put any baba- to the point i had to ask for more. There was one feta square, i paid an extra dollar for a square of feta. Oooh and when i asked for more baba i handed them the sandwich open so they can see there was no baba and the one girl goes ""i see baba"" and joshua the cashier then says ""yea, she just wants to complain"" while the manager laughed....i was literally right there. It was as though they were speaking loud for me to hear. The falafel is missing the allspice flavor it use to have and the tahini isn't tangy anymore. When i ordered a mint lemonade joshua suggested ""joshua juice"" a lemonade and mango mix i said I'll try it. He charged me for 2 juices....why?

Anyway, I picked out shawarma, fool mudammas (a fava bean salad), tabbouleh, baba ganouj, salad, and a whole wheat pita. Both my stomach and tastebuds were quite satisfied. The baba ganouj especially stood out, with a well-defined, smoky flavor.For sipping, I ordered the house spiced black iced tea (~$2). It's made with cardamom and was reviving after a long day.

I have been a loyal Mamoun's patron for over 17 years - since the days of skipping high school classes to visit the one in Middletown, CT, which isn't even open anymore! From that one to New Haven to both NYC villages and Hoboken, I've always praised the quality and price of the menu. Recently, the Hoboken location moved from Washington/5th to Washington/3rd. I'm not sure what happened during this move, but the price went up and the quality plummeted. Tonight I ordered the Mamoun's Salad with a side of falafel and a side of the pickled veggies/olives. The price cost at least $5 more total than it usually would and the salad was half the size - I was upset to see that my now $8 salad was an appetizer rather than an entree. Additionally, the size of falafel, which per the menu should have been 4 pieces, only came with 3 -- again paying more and getting less. Although the falafel itself was tasty, the sad salad lacked. It came soggy and the olives/pickled vegetables tasted... off. What used to be my favorite part, the pickled turnips, were flappy and looked as though they were sitting around a bit too long. The olives tasted sour and spoiled. My heart breaks to write this as I've been eating Mamoun's for most my life. Are you ordering your product from a new source?

I thought it could've been a bad batch but after it happened again a month later I've made the decision to opt out. The fries are also perfect. If you're feelin' wild I suggest dipping them in hummus. ;-) I still haven't had better grape leaves than what Mamoun's offers.

For $7 it's a pretty good deal - and felt like it was enough food. I didn't opt for the platter ($12) but I'll definitely try it next time. Solid, consistent lunch spots are hard to come by here in Hoboken, so I'm really hoping Mamoun's is one of them.

The sandwiches were reasonably priced at $3.50 for the falafel and $6.50 for the chicken kebab, but note that the sandwiches are very small. The sandwiches came with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, tahini sauce in a pita pocket. Ask for the hot sauce to add a kick to your sandwich. Both the falafel and chicken kebab were tasty and had good flavor, but just wish there was more more meat/falafel in each sandwich. We will be back to try the plates.

The menu is relatively small, and pretty cheap (prices have gone up a bit since they first opened), but of course you'd get a much better value elsewhere (Paterson). But they do have my favorite lamb shawarma sandwich, ever, along with some of the spiciest hot sauce that has decent flavor. Their falafel is pretty good, but overpriced.

The best part is they're open well past the closing of bars on weekends. So you have a great ethnic option besides the Spa diner and meh pizza late night.I've docked it a star because they seem to have changed management. Everything seems a little more exact(in a streamlined corporate way) . Portions a bit smaller. Every employee I used to know and who knew me by name has vanished. Food is still very good...

I mistakenly assumed this place was halal and later was told by a family member it isn't (they don't advertise the meat as halal, so it was my fault). When I did used to eat the meat, I always got the shawarma sandwich. The meat is seasoned and cooked perfectly. Overall a really good sandwich. The hummus here is to die for. So yummy! Falafel sandwiches are the bomb. If you ever want to add a kick to your food they have a super spicy, flavorful, and delicious hot sauce. Plenty of yummy authentic middle-eastern options for dessert. The ingredients they use here all seem to be fresh and the place is always somewhat packed every time I visit, and for a good reason. It's unfortunate how I can't eat the meat anymore because I found out it's not halal. Halal just means the animal is killed in a manner where it experiences the least amount of pain possible, prayed upon, organic and a few more standards I don't want to get into detail about.

I don't know why my ""Ma moons"" them but what I do know is, it's become so famous here in Ho-boken, that they have renamed the restaurant after these predictable moonings, accordingly.What to get: Pita combo with Falafel and ShawarmaWhat else: I have a super hot Yelp friend who lives just near this location (hi!)Why this Mamoun's: Best service and best food of any locationIf the employees thought my mother was a cow (they may do by now), it'd be Ma-moos.My best experiences of Mamoun's of Hoboken are when I leave Buffalo shortly before Midnight, and then still manage to miraculously make it to this location before they close, which is 5am on Fri and Sat. I actually managed to roll in here by about 4.47am before a 5am close, after a 6-hour-high-speed drive from Buffalo. Not only did they serve me, but gave me a bunch of free stuff. Customer service was absolutely exemplary. Quite the opposite of that waitress in Syracuse. Mamoun's has some of the best customer service anywhere. Lovely guys.If a hot Yelp girl in Texas sent me a music player to work out to, it'd be Ma-Zune's.Hummus World (Long Island) was the best until it closed down. Mamoun's is the best that is still alive, it's exemplary and incomparably delicious. OK, their shawarma is a little grizzly and fatty and chewy. Tastes delish though. OK, their Ho-boken location is small. But my goodness this pita sandwich is otherworldly and perfect. I pita the fool that disagrees.If Bart Simpson and Eric Cartman were regulars here (Eric is a regular everywhere), they'd be Ma-Cartoons.Get the shawarma and falafel combo in a pita. It's just $6.50 and stuff it with *everything*. When I say everything, I mean pickles, hummus, crazy flavourful bits n pieces of spiced veggies, drizzled with tahini. It comes together into an absolute miracle.If all the guys in here had a crush on me (or my Mum), they'd be Ma-Swoons.They do have other stuff like Kofte and Chicken. But I'm never able to stray from the tried and trusted Shawarma + Falafel combo in a Pita. It's so good.If you saw Tom Green's fave bird here, they'd be Ma-Loon's. And that's not very fun. When you always expose your bum. Or rather your Mum. Or rather she exposes her own Bum. Maybe it's where I get it from.I've also tried the Mabrumeh, which is a honey-drenched nutty dessert similar to Baklava, and is absolutely delicious and well worth a try. Notice that dessert sounds like desert, so no wonder the Middle-Easterners make good ones. I first had it here, and it's amazing.If they sold digital songs whereby the artist got almost no profit, they'd be Ma-itunes.As well as the ridiculously low price (NYC area and yet 6.50 for a stuffed pita full of heaven), there's the added bonus of their hours. 5am on Fri and Sat, and 1, 2 or 3 on other nights. So you can come for breakfast if you're insane and up early. The MacDougal Manhattan location is open til 5am every night!If they closed at 12pm instead of 5am, they'd be Ma-noon's.Since Hummus World is gone, get one of these Mamoun's these combo pita sandwiches with everything in it. It's so good, you may cry. Middle Eastern deliciousness at its best. Until HW is resurrected, Mamoun's is my favourite pita kebab in all of New York State, and possibly in the USA.And if they had big scary sand worms (no not my sand-worm, but actual sci-fi sand worms) then they'd be Ma-Dune's. Or after my sex change, then Ma-P**n's. Wait, what? You didn't know I was having a sex change? Yeah Eva talked me into it. She said she usually prefers men but for me, she just gets a ""girlie vibe."" I dunno if this is a good thing or not, but she says that after the operation she will show me a very, very good thing.And when people say ""your life has been a rollercoaster... does it ever get hard?"" Then I'll finally be able to say ""no, never. Not even partially."" And mean it. I think that will make me feel great about myself.Besides, becoming a girl worked for Starlight's favourite boy-turned girl, Cat-lyn Jenner. It worked for Zac Afro, The Artist Formerly Known As Pint-Sized, and Justine Belieber. Then I saw her face. Now I'm a Belieber. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love with Justin Belieber, I hope he leaves Selena tonight. Oh, wait, I missed the boat on that one. Sweaty.What I do know, and nobody can ever tell me otherwise, is that shorty is an eenie meanie miny moe lover. However when it comes to Falafel and Shawarma sandwiches, there is no choice for her to make. She goes straight for Mamoun's. Not that she ever goes straight, mind you. But you knew what I meant.

Near perfect pita, mind blowing falafel- and the perfect balance of creamy tehina and crunchy salad.My experience in Hoboken wasn't much different. Though I had more than $5, and ordered food to go...everything was as you'd expect. Hot, flavorful and very much made with love and intention.

All jokes aside I love maamouns and visit frequently. The chicken kebob sandwhich is what I normally get and would recommend.

The service is fast without having an impact on the quality and the workers are always quite pleasant. Seating can be tough during busy times but they have outdoor seating to accommodate.

So much flavor and perfectly cooked pieces of chicken breast. Sandwiches are about $6 while platters are $12 and include a bit more meat as well as salad or rice. They also have combinations where you can pick 1 meat dish and 3 veggies (hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, tabouli, etc). I loved the tahini/dressing on the salad that came with the plater. It made what would have been a mediocre salad actually very good. I liked my food enough that I will actually come back to the shit show that is Washington Street next time I want kebabs or shwarma.A few things I didn't like- 1) SALT. Been here twice and both times, the meat was extremely salty. The food as great flavor so this is really not necessary. 2) Step up your salad game! The onions and tomatoes and lettuce were fresh but for $12, I would like something more than iceburg. 3) $1 more for getting both salad and rice seems unnecessary. Yes, you get a lot of food but it's still $12. I think this surcharge is a bit ridic.Still though, Mamoun's is an excellent option and is open really late.

We got one of their platters--meant for one person but we shared--with shwarma, baba ganoush, hummus, and falafel along with salad and a pita and then another side order of grape leaves.Both the shwarma and the falafel were perfect, they had great seasoning and came with a heaping pile of shwarma. If you like falafel and you're considering getting this option to sample the popular choices I'd suggest getting another side order of falafel if you like it. Ours only came with three, and I would have ordered a little more if I was hungrier. I've had better baba ganoush, but this was good enough. The hummus was incredibly creamy and so delicious!

They have several tables inside and outside for those nice summer days. Even though they are always crazy busy, food comes out in a timely fashion.The Falafel sandwich is absolutely delicious ($3.50 each). For those that don't know, its deep fried chickpeas, fava beans or sometimes both, and usually put in pita bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and hummus or tahini sauce. Its great for vegetarians and vegans as well. The falafel here are perfectly crispy, filled with flavor and compliment the toppings nicely. My only dislike is that the bread isn't strong enough to hold the sauce they use. So halfway in, it tends to break apart and fall off. Easy fix is just getting the sauce on the side, and that solves the problem. Kafta sandwich is to die for. The Lamb patty is seasoned perfectly and has great flavors. Although I wish the patty was a bit thicker, for $6.50 I really can't complain. For dessert, I shared a knafe, it was very sweet and loaded with honey, one bite and I was done, it is good but can't have the whole piece by yourself.Prices are very reasonable, I suggest to get 2 sandwiches since one isn't going to fill anyone up unless your on a strict diet.

But living in Jersey I didn't want to go that far, so I was thrilled to find out there's on in Hoboken! Still far but much better than going through the Lincoln. Their hummus is some of the best I e had- and I'm Arab so I've had pretty much them all. Their hot sauce is amazing (and super spicy). Their chicken is extremely good, and I'm a very picky chicken eater. Their falafel is also great- again some of the best I've had (my go to is in Paterson but I've had some in Egypt and also Gaza, Palestine). The prices are okay- little more than I'd like to spend for that food but not crazy by any means. Their tabuli is pretty good as well. And you'll have to try the Baba Ganush- amazing.Overall, this place is great. I just wish it had a bigger dinning room! But like most places in Hoboken, there's no room to expand. I'm not into beef or lamb but my family and friends say the lamb is to die for. Also, don't forget the mint lemonade! Absolutely perfect!Overall, go here!

Its about $3.50 and I was STUFFED! It was fresh food and the staff was so nice. I got a small side of Baba ganoush ($2) if you have no idea what Baba ganoush is, its eggplant.Typically its roasted eggplant, with sesame seeds, tahini, and the works (olive oil, garlic, lemon).

You'll just get one. After the 5th time now I'm pretty confident this seems to be the long term habit. It's a shame because until a couple of months ago the food was just impeccable, delivered hot and with the promised amount of bread. It's not like I couldn't live without the bread but usually the paying customer gets what you promise him. Conclusion: if you got the choice between a plate and a sandwich? Get the sandwich... You get what you expect and it is way cheaper. :) Though if you don't care and need some food for lunch the next day, the plate is a good option too because of its size.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

My friend said it was like a home-cooked meal. She approved. And I really enjoyed my meal. Great flavor, portion, and you don't spend a lot. My only complain was the tazaki sauce should've been put on the side or just less of it. I didn't like that it was doused all over the shawarma.

Oh wow!!!! So tender, melted in your mouth.  STUFFED in the pita, almost overflowing, I tasted the lamb on it's own.  Wow.  I will dream of that lamb, it was that good.Mint lemonade was an excellent beverage to compliment our meal.  He had the blackberry juice - just sweet enough.  I was so impressed.  I have not felt the need to get on yelp and review ANYTHING until today.  And now....well, I'm back, folks.Ambiance was chill, very clean inside.  Counter guy was very friendly.  And the price, for 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and 2 specialty beverages? $18 dollars.

191,w2hgtWwrBYJicZiTcr-ELg,Jessie H.,4.0 star rating,"Oh, Mamoun's. You're always there for me. (Seriously, if you could date a restaurant I would date Mamoun's.)I always stick to the vegetarian options here - falafel, hummus, baba gannoush, the best tabouli ever - they're all great. They offer the same pita and combo plate deals they do in the city - $3.50 for one veggie on pita and $4 for two options (go with falafel and hummus + hot sauce) and $5 for a massive platter of a veggie item over salad with a large amount of pickled veggies, olives and tahini. You can pay a little more and make the platter a combo as well. The tahini sauce is crack. Delicious, delicious crack - I always order extra on the side and extra hot sauce (which is as hot as people say. Proceed with caution if you value your taste buds.)Possibly the best part about this Mamoun's is that they offer free delivery in Hoboken on orders over $10. So, if you're a lazy sonofabitch like me, you can order a falafel platter, a side of tabouli and a hummus and falafel sandwich (with all that extra tahini and hot sauce on the side), spend less than $15 bucks and have a mountain of food delivered to you within 10 minutes, all without putting on pants.They are not as efficient as the locations in the city - even if there's no one in line ahead of you, you'll wait 5 minutes for your pita and when it's busy you can wait for quite some time, but it's definitely worth the wait (and there's actually comfortable space to wait in unlike the cramped W village and E village locations) and overall I prefer it here.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

This time I ran inside and my order bag was ready. I went home and noticed they forgot to give me extra Tahini sauce and hot sauce which I had requested while paying.

[Yes, I'm here all day].Last night, I was out in Hoboken helping a friend film a short film. Afterwards, he decided to treat me to grub. (The only upside of pro bono work). He's Lebanese, so he likes to search around for great Middle Eastern fare. Well, Mamoun's is certainly the bees' knees. We get there and he says ""I'm ordering you two sandwiches"". He orders me the falafel sammich, and the shawarma sammich. I dove into the falafel sandwich first. While it was heavily loaded with ""crunchy water"" (lettuce) and ""red rings of death"" (tomatoes), I was pleased when I finally got to the falafel. Very tasty, seasoned well, great texture and consistency. Less veggies would have made the falafel stand out a bit more, but the creamy sauce totally did its duty. It was dainty and creamy enough to play the side chick, but was still bold enough to let you KNOW ""I'm in the background, boo"".Then I tried the shawarma... And I immediately felt my eyes rolling back in my head. Kinda like that feeling when your Q-tip, ear-cleaning session becomes a wildly pleasant experience. The meat was adorned with great seasoning, cooked properly and moist, and there was an ABUNDANCE of it. My goodness. The pièce de résistance was the mint lemonade that I washed it down with. I could have sworn I was having a delicious, citrusy, virgin Mojito. If they had rum, I would have walked out under noticeable inebriation. Most definitely.Love this spot.

I ordered the veggie combo - falafel, baba and hummus to go.  when I got home, which isn't to far from the restaurant, I didn't see/notice any baba and I believe there was a falafel inside. I was told in the past, ""what do you expect for a $4.50 sandwich at 11pm.  The restaurant is catering to drinking/drunk crowd who doesn't care for the quality of the food.  They are just looking for any food to soak up the alcohol"".  I certainly understand that statement now.  Falafel sandwiches are basic street food in the Middle East served to perfection any time of the day or nite.  I certainly miss that experience. I had broccoli in my falafel as a part of the sandwich, which I never had before in the 30+yrs eating these sandwiches and the overall sandwich was VERY basic.  The falafel sandwich I make at home with the salad was far superior.  Next time I get a late nite craving for a falafel sandwich, I will take the PATH to TAIM in the west village.  This Israeli place is always consisted...day or nite.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

My mouth craved their awesome falafel sandwich, and my belly would not be denied!Mamoun's is one of those hole in the wall places that has been around since the 1970's and has a few locations in NY and Jersey. Decor here is one of the better locations as it's larger and has more seating like an actual restaurant. Yes, this location is a little bigger than those in Manhattan and is still meant to be a quick grab and go food spot, but you can also chill out over a meal here. Clean bathroom too.If there is one thing they do here they do it exceptionally well - and that is make a kick ass falafel sandwich! Only $3.00! An excellent bargain for a most enjoyable crispy taste sensation. The guys behind the counter are super quick no-nonsense types that whip out your food lightning fast. You can't get any cheaper than this. Even though it has gone up .50 from the $2.50 I paid not too long ago it's a nice sized pita sandwich that tastes delicious! Like it hot and spicy? As with the other locations their hot sauce is like molten lava. Put a few drops on your food and kiss your taste buds and intestines goodbye. If you crave the heat you will love this sauce. Don't go overboard!This Mamoun's takes credit cards, but others were cash only as I remember.

The falafel sandwich is also top notch. I advise you to grab one of each.Finish that off with one of the many juices (tamarind, mint lemonade, mango or whatever they may have, because they are all glorious in their own way).Then while youre sitting there in this euphoric state of mind order a baklava, and then go back home and realize life will never be as good as it was while you were eating here.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

While service was not always outstanding, the food, the hours and the price made up for the difference. During my visit to Mamoun's in Hoboken, I was disappointed at the shabby service. The staff made faces when I requested cups of water. One of the staff decided to move away a patron's bike without asking the owner for permission to do so. I was also ridiculed when I tried to tell the staff about my prior visits to Mamoun's. I had requested for some of the falafels (otherwise very tasty) with very little tahini. There was no difference in the tahini amount in all my falafels. The food itself is tasty. The falafel balls have the perfect texture on the outside. Not too greasy and fair sized. My fiancee enjoyed her grape balls but was not too happy with the Fool mudammas. The description says that fool mudammas beans are flavored with olive oil and garlic.

This location has more juice items as well as the addition of rice and add-ons you can add to your favorite sandwiches and platters. However, the service is slower and the food is watered down. The tahini sauce was noticeably thinner than the other locations as well as toned down on the flavor, and the mango juice was also not as pulpy as i have previously had. The portions are bigger here but if you cant maintain the same famous taste as Mamoun's is generally know for then it shouldnt be called Mamoun's, rather just an imitation of it.

They were also chintzy on the side pita (also white), giving less than we've gotten in the past. What broke the camels back is that when we called to complain about the order not being what we asked for, they told us that they ""always run out of whole wheat"" at this hour and that's all there is to it. Seems to me if you always run out, you should plan to have more available so you can serve your customers what they actually ordered.

It's a very simple place. The menu on the wall is clear and in large print. I recommend the falafel and hummus sandwich if one is to go for a vegetarian meal. I'm no vegetarian, but there's times where I'm not feeling the meat and this hits the spot. Combine it with a cool Spiced Tea and it's a real winner and won't hit your wallet hard at all. Everyone who works here is really nice and friendly, even if the interaction is limited. I like that because despite only a few minutes talking with employees, it's great when it's a pleasurable experience. The casual atmosphere is really nice as well. I like having a place to sit and eat, or just wait for my food if it's not busy. Some other reviewers have mentioned the fact that quality suffers when ordering delivery. In my experience, I haven't noted that to be the case all that much. Like anything else, it's always better in the restaurant yet I don't feel there's a huge drop in quality.

It's a pita stuffed to the brim (does a pita pocket have a brim?) with their delicious falafel, lettuce, tomato, hummus (I assume it's homemade because the ole Sabra from the deli just doesn't measure up), and tahini.The falafel is hot and crunchy, the veggies are cold and crispy, and the tahini gets all over your hands such that you smell like delicious sesame for the rest of the day. Just the way I like it. Some rave about the lentil soup, and it's good, but I wasn't all that impressed. It's vegetarian but pretty much just tastes like chicken soup with a little bit of chopped carrots, lentils, and barley. Wouldn't get it again, but that's okay because if I could take one $4 item to a deserted island, it would be a falafel pita from Mamoun's.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

I've been here on Friday or Saturday, when It is open till 2 or 3 am. So, if you're late in town, it is always there to grab a nice meal. It is on a busy street. So, finding a parking spot is the only hassle. Most times, I've been there after midnight. So, its quite easier to find a parking spot.

I appreciate the quick paced environment, especially when I just want to eat and be on my way. I call it a falafel place, but there are of course other options. I always order the falafel sandwich and ask for extra tahini sauce on the side. I love to drench the sandwich in the extra tahini and then add drops of red garlic hot sauce every few bites. The falafel are always fresh, hot, and well cooked. I like that they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I feel for $3.50, a falafel sandwich is a decent price. I do wish the price could be a little lower or they could have a frequent eater card with perks/rewards! I should add that the tomatoes, onions, and salad mix in the falafel sandwich is always clean and also fresh tasting and fresh looking. I highly recommend anything with falafel at Mamoun's. It is vegetarian friendly and relatively healthy! Aside from the things mentioned, another suggestion I have is to please offer 100% whole wheat pita for the dishes!

The hummus and pita was also very tasty and exploding with flavor. I could've easily given the place a 4/5 star, but overall cleanliness was lacking and that's never a great sign.

Not hummus in a pita. only lettuce and tahini. Very few falafel balls in pita. Price is expensive relative to the amount of falafel balls inside the pita. Very very expensive in relation to what you get. The amount of USD 3.75 for a very, very thin pita very thin and easily torn. In Israel, the country from which the original Falafel is coming , inside Falafel sandwitch with pita you get least 6 or 7 very large balls. In addition, In Israel you get at no extra cost unlimited salads as Israeli salad, hummus free of charge, eggplant salad at no extra charge.

The sandwich is so good though so you won't mind the mess. If you're up for some spices, drop a few drops of their classic red hot sauce. It will give your sandwich a spicy kick but don't go overboard. Have water by the side. The people at the counter will give out a complimentary cup of water. For dessert, I shared the Mabrumeh. The bottom pastry is very sweet as its loaded with honey. The top is loaded with various nuts and is not as sweet as the flaky pastry.

But I dunno, I just thought it was okay. As a warning, their desserts are super sweet. To the point of being a little gross. I think they'd actually be really good if they dialed down the sugar. I had this crispy kind of cinnabun with what must've been 5 pounds of raw sweetness infused into it. After two bites I had to put it down, I was worried I was gonna get diabetes! Three stars because I know I'm being a little harsh - I probably would've enjoyed this place if I didn't have massive expectations.

The shawarma is delicious and not too covered in spice so you can really taste the flavor of the meat. The rice is absolutely delicious, and the blackberry juice is a sweet refresher for your palette. I wasn't a huge fan of the salad that came with my plate, although it could be that I am not overly fond of foods that incorporate a lot of herbs and spices, which the salad was loaded with. It all looked fresh though.Service here was okay. You place your order, take a seat, and the staff wanders around trying to figure out which seated party ordered what. They would be much better off if they came up with a ""take a number,"" system that they could tie to your order so waitstaff could find you more easily. This probably wouldn't be a problem during slower times, but when I went, it was busy and we ended up flagging down the waiters who had our order.Something to keep in mind: the plate servings are rather large, so unless you're used to eating large portions, you may want to split a plate with a friend or just order individual dishes as sides rather than try to eat the whole thing yourself.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

I was pleasantly surprised to see that this location was about 4 times bigger than the one in the east village, with seating for about 20 people or so.When we got our shawarmas ($5.50 for a decent sized one), my friend downed his and automatically ordered us a second round. The meat was seasoned and grilled perfectly, with the tahini sauce perfectly complimenting the tender meat.I already love Mamoun's shawarma and am glad that I can get one without having to go into NYC. I will definitely be back!P.S. for falafel lovers, Mamoun's is supposedly one of the best places to get falafel, and at $2.50 for a sandwich, their prices cant be beat either.

I definitely like this kind of food and have been spoiled by having excellent tasty falafel, hummus, shawarma, kebobs, adana, pitas, zasiki, labneh, fatush, etc., so this place is like a sit down fast food place for college students or simply for a quick fill me up. The food could be better, but I am definitely going back because it not terrible, it is just lacking a little flavor. In reality, I think it deserves 3.5 starts but I cannot give this, so 3 will be.

The falafel is perfectly seasoned and the grilled chicken plate is addictive.  The hummus is lemony and garlicky the way it ought to be.  The shawarma is as good as any I have had outside of Jordan.  The soup is a perfect starter during the cold months of winter, and the staff always gives me a ton of fresh pita with it.  Don't forget to add the asskicking hot sauce to your food, and make sure you order a large mint lemonade to wash it down with afterwards.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

This is only a review of the food and their delivery service.The delivery experience is quite pleasant. Once you've ordered there before, they ask for your phone number and have your address on file. You tell them your order and within 30 minutes, they show up at your doorstep with the food. No muss, no fuss. In fact, they're quite polite over the phone which, as many know, is a bit of a luxury.For this place to be ""cheap"", I stay away from the plates and only order sandwiches. The sandwiches are huge. The falafel and shawarma are delicious. I have a famous falafel place back home and this might actually be better.This is some of the best lentil soup I've ever had too. It's soul-warming comfort soup. Get some.About the only thing I can say that's negative is the pita that comes with the hummus. I'm pretty sure they send along the ends of the pita they cut off while making the sandwiches which is fine, but they always taste a few days old.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

I have been going to the original on MacDougal Street in NY for over a decade now and it never would get old. It actually became an event at my fraternity house while in college to send the pledges there to get all the brothers falafels and schwarmas. So you can only imagine how excited I was to find out one opened in Hoboken...So about the food; it does not disappoint. The falafel sandwich's are simple yet perfect, the lamb in the schwarma has a great spice to it. Adding hummus to either one of these makes a home run. The tabouli salad is awesome if you like pickled things and mint. If you like spicy things, try the hot sauce on the tables, I DARE YOU! I would say I eat there on average twice a week for a quick dinner after the gym or with my gf to when we are looking for something  asap.

I've been back quite a few times, especially on Friday's in Lent and everything I have tried has been really good. The only watch out is the hot sauce is very very hot. It's absolutely delicious, but I was not expecting it to be as hot as it was (and this is coming from someone who puts Frank's or Crushed Red peppers on just about everything).

613,-5j_5sPfYkcqa70hVUzqQw,La L.,2.0 star rating,"Food is okay, but to be honest it's inconsistent. Falafel shouldn't be hard and crunchy on the inside. Not sure what that was all about. I do really like the mint lemonade but the hubs said it smelled like body odor which was actually kinda true and now I'm turned off. Thanks for that, hon, now I can't erase it from my brain! Chicken pita was meh but maybe I caught a bad day. Overall I really wish this place was more consistent with its food because I do love Middle Eastern food.

It's not even close, they have the best falafel and schwarma and its also the cheapest option, I really don't get why people go to the other options. Their hot sauce is amazing, just be careful, it will burn for those not ready for it. They also have homemade drinks which are very good, I personally don't like drinks loaded with sugar, and theirs are just right.If you want a full dish, I would recommend a sit down Turkish/Middle Eastern place but as far as falafel/schwarma goes, this is by far the best option.",Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Middle, Eastern,, Falafel"

631,RaWXrmDQLtuspE3Y1yjCYg,M J.,5.0 star rating,"Somehow, for some reason, Hoboken is now neck deep in falafel joints; or at least places you can get falafel. I am amused by the fact that Mamoun's is the only  one of those places that hasn't had to offer free samples on the street in order to get people to walk in. Its got plenty of NYC street cred and the new location has held to the standards that has made it a must-visit on a street crowded with eateries.The food-Small, focused menu executed just right just about every time. Cheap? after tax, the falafel sandwich is $2.70. The hummus is GREAT. The tahini is lovely and savory. The pickled treats are a great counterpoint to many of the offerings. It normally goes ""you can have it cheap, you can have it fast, you can have it good: pick two.""With Mamoun's, you don't have to choose.
