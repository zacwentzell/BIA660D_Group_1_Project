It is unassuming.  When you walk in, you feel transported back in time with the beautiful window view looking onto the cobble stone street.  The atmosphere is very homey and enjoyable.  The service is great.Their Sunday brunch is fantastic.  They give you Irish Soda Bread and fresh fruit to start.  They have delicious brunch drink specials, I recommend the Peach Bellini. The burgers are cooked perfectly, they impressed my parents which is  hard to do.  Love their chicken sandwich as well and the bread makes the sandwich.Their dinners are delicious as well.  Great comfort food, cannot go wrong with anything.  I especially like the shrimp and pasta in a white wine cream sauce.The price is great and the service is always impeccable.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

However, if you venture in past the bar, you'll see that they actually have a proper dining room in the back. I came in with my boyfriend and his parents on a Thursday at around 8, and it wasn't too packed.To start, we had the brie baked in a puff pastry, and the calamari. Both were great. The brie was nice and melty inside the perfectly toasted pastry. The calamari was extra crispy, without being or tasting too oily. As for the entrees, these were a bit lackluster. I had the penne with wweet Italian sausage. It was pretty basic - nothing I couldn't make at home. Unlike the appetizers, this on the other hand, was a bit too oily. But it might be from the sausage, which they did give a pretty generous portion of, so can't really complain about that. The prices have a pretty huge range. Some dishes are pretty reasonably priced (like my pasta dish, which was $13), but others seem to be expensive for no reason (like crab cakes for $24).

What I love about the space is that you can keep it low key and sit at the bar area or you can go into the dining room for date night. I came here twice already. First time it was in a Sunday and sat at the bar since there was a football game going on. Had a as an appetizer the crab cake and the portobello mushroom with broccoli rabe out of the specials for the night. The crab cake was Amazing and was the reason I wanted to go back so bad (well at least one of the reasons) for entree my husband had the rabbit and I had the shrimp and lobster in vodka sauce over linguini. Both so delicious and so fresh. It was literally a work of art ! For desert I had a pumpkin chocolate pie with coffee. The coffee was also great and that pie was divine ( another one of my reasons for going back!) 2nd time around went into the dining area on a Saturday and had as an appetizer the baked Brie and calamari. Calamari was so fresh and not fishy at all (which is a great sign) the breading was so light. That Brie was also something out of this world. Entree had fish and chips and my husband had some coq au vin. Needless to say we were not disappointed. Followed by another cup of coffee and a peanut butter chocolate pie ( the pumpkin wasn't served on that night) Definitely, a place to go and try! Worth every cent!

They do a brisk business but didn't seem to mind my friend and I sitting for a bit after we paid to catch up. I ordered the Eggs Florentine Benedict ($11) which was delicious. They do a great poached egg and I was really glad I ordered them as the eggs were cooked well and ran the just right amount when I cut into them. My friend got 3 eggs any way and also got the poached eggs so highly recommended.

We were seated quickly at the bar and greeted nicely by a gentleman behind the bar. We ultimately knew we only wanted to try the lobsters so we ordered right away. We didn't need to wait much, plus it was nice we recorded a basket of bread, butter and olive tapenade. Unfortunately the bread was really crunchy so we didn't bother to eat much of that. The meal comes with a house salad, which I didn't care too much for. A side of baked potato, mashed beets and veggies, which I enjoyed. The lobsters came out pre cracked but still in tact, butter on the side. It was pretty good, and you really can't complain because it's only $20 for all of that! It's an affordable means to having a nice seafood meal - highly recommend and will be coming back to try out their other menu items!",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

French toast was good, but what i liked about the hash was that it was real shredded corned beef, clearly not the canned stuff that has an odd texture to it (does that stop me from eating it? no, but I'm just making a comment). for an extra dollar you can get Vermont maple syrup, which is a great bonus. live it up, homeslice.service is still great and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. the front pub area is still a great place to hang out and watch some sports games and sip some good beers, while the back dining area is a little more upscale.okay, clarification on that last point: upscale enough that a large group of basic white girls in sundresses can occupy a big table for brunch, but still casual enough that I can wear a metal band t-shirt and faded jeans at the table across from them. that's how I roll.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

For $20 your meal comes with a soup or salad appetizer, a 1 1/4 lb. lobster with choice of potato and vegetables of the day. There are also 2+ lb lobsters available for #30-35. It's a great deal and I strongly recommend taking advantage! This is was my boyfriend ordered for a meal. I tacked on 1/2 dozen oysters for appetizer and had the Seafood Pasta as my entree. From start to finish, everything was executed perfectly. My pasta was delicious and I nearly licked the plate clean. For fresh seafood, the value can't be beat.

There's nothing special about these dishes, but they were well prepared and tasty; the latter in particular went well with the garlic aioli, while the former was quite a bit of food.

I ordered chicken parm, about 17 bucks or so. The chicken was very good, the pasta and sauce were okay.Overall the food was good, but the atmosphere was dreadful, I don't see how they have a sports bar like image from the window, only to reveal a fancy dining room 10 feet from the bar.

The bar is great, the food is spectacular, and the specials definitely go above and beyond. I came here with my husband last night and we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. We didn't have a reservation and expected to wait for a seat, so we went to the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria which was very good. We waited for all of five minutes before the hostess came by and said they were ready for us. I ordered the tricolor salad for an appetizer which was a special along with the rack of lamb. My husband had French onion soup and the filet mignon. Both dishes were very tasty. I can't comment on my husbands soup because he inhaled it before I could ask for a bite.

Wrong the pitcher was not the type of pitcher you expect,it was prob 2 pints less the ice.  Bloody Mary was just ok.We ordered some burgers and French toast for our daughter.   I had to ask for my coffee 3x before I got it... Burgers were ok - nothing special (bare burger way better), the kitchen forgot the bacon tho so I asked for a side.    it came 5 minutes later and was way over cooked it just simply crumbled.Bill came, charged me twice for one of our orders, but waitress fixed the bill.    We boxed our toddler's French toast *with the syrup* (like the ones you get at McDonald's in little single serve plastic container).     Got home went to feed our toddler they didn't pack the syrup we put on the plate next to the French toast.  Weird, probably re entered the rotation... Lol, decided at that point to Yelp this place.All in all, first and last time to this place.   Food was average at best, service subpar.   Cost a little high but not outrageous...

The Starving Hobokenite is a tour de force of brunch food, and everything in it was delicious. Their pancakes are fluffy and just the right size, and the sausage is quite good. Their omelettes are also very tasty. So why only three stars?The service and drinks left something to be desired. The service was rather slow, and my table was never served the fresh fruit or Irish soda bread that came with brunch (and that every other table received). I didn't care much about the lack of Irish soda bread, given all the other food I was having with my meal, but it was a bit strange that everyone else got bread and fruit, and we didn't. Though, honestly, not sure why they even serve Irish soda bread with brunch - it seems superfluous given all the pancakes/french toast/muffins/etc.My table also got a pitcher of mimosas, which was served with tons of ice in the pitcher. Who puts ice in a mimosa? Watered it down a ton, and given the amount of ice in the pitcher, we wound up not getting much of the actual drink. Great food, but needs improvement on some other items.

You've got a dedicated lobster by the pound menu, seafood, meat and poultry and tons of specials. My bf and I came here for dinner at 9 and didn't have an issue getting A table. But people started to clear out after 45 minutes. Our waiter was really nice and made tons of suggestions- we asked a lot of questions. He was good about refilling waters Too. The entrees pricing wasn't bad- high teens, low twenties, but the apps were in the $10 range. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller which was more creamed spinach then oyster, and it was also not shucked well as I had pieces floating in my mouth. Big fail at 4 at $8.95. The bread basket wasn't anything special- it was dry stale ish bread. But the olive and Caper tapenade was great. As far as dinner goes, I ordered the corvina- a sea bass like white fish. I wasn't that flaky. It was fattier and more substantial than most white fish. It was served in an awesome white wine sauce. I liked the roasted spinning and beet purée but I didn't like my Au gratin potatoes- they were a bit bland and needed salt. My bf ordered the filet mignonette of pork- he said it was good, ESP. The rich Marsala wine sauce. I tried a little of his mashed and it was good. We ordered some drinks. My bf got the winter ale staff special- which we said wasn't as bitter as he liked. I thought my wine was really good- I got the premium Viognier from their award winning affiliate winery. It was fruity and light, but zesty. Lastly, we ordered the homemade cheesecake. It was not as Dry as my bf prefers it but I thought it was good. I also don't eat cheesecake too much so I don't know all the nuances.

107,9LNKSIN49SrT24eZHCYivw,Randi E.,2.0 star rating,"Court Street was our first thought, but I had reservations because I never have been a fan. And this time would not convert me either.After waiting in the front bar, rowdy for St. Patrick's Day, we were sat in the loud dinning room. For the holiday, our breadbasket included Irish soda bread, a sweet pleasant surprise. That night, we just ordered mains.My father had the beef Burgundy, which was served on a bed of yellow egg noodles. The stew looked pretty non-descript, but the portion was heaping and the sauce was hot.For my mother, the penne with seared scallops, artichoke hearts, tomato, and basil, coated in a little garlicky olive oil, one of the specials. The plate was pretty, but just looked like pasta. The plump scallops had a nice sear and the penne was al dente, adding textural balance.The chicken Francaise that my sister had was tasty, but just kind of dull. There was nothing super amazing about it, in fact, it is something would have tasted just as good if made at home. This was the same of the mashed potatoes.I ordered the panko-encrusted tuna dish, which was described as sushi-grade tuna, seared on the outside but a perfect rare on the inside. That is what I got, but it too was lacking and the crust was overwhelming. The sauces-- a wet spicy wasabi dressing, and a thick sesame aioli--made up for the missing flavor. The wasabi sauce was super hot and almost uncomfortable for me.In the end, the best things were the side and garnish. The olive tapenade served with the bread is super amazing, briny, creamy, chunky and delicious. The evening's vegetable, sautéed green beans, was salty, buttery, tasty and addictive. And that puree garnish, sitting pretty on the plate, was sweet and savory, like carrots.There was nothing remotely tempting or different for dessert, so quite unlike us, we skipped it. All this being said, Court Street is like a family place, like sitting down to dinner at home for home-cooked food. There is nothing extraordinary about the food, the menu or the place, but that is not really what it is supposed to be. It's not about innovation, but the classics people can rely on.

I had the beef carpaccio special which was a generous portion for an appetizer and nicely executed. I think my favorite part was that they gave me tapenade with bread to start.

The prices are outrageous - for a mediocre, ""steak sandwich"" - toasted white bread, a small over-cooked steak, sprinkling of onions & mushrooms and smothered in cheese (at $1-1.50 EACH, to ADD ON), I was charged $20!  Edible? Maybe. But worth like $8.

Beware if you have a big stroller because it's a little hard to get in and out of the restaurant, and they don't allow strollers in the dining area.  So you either have to collapse it or park it outside.  I'd suggest bringing a lock or wearing your baby.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

If you are familiar with the Hoboken restaurant scene, you know that nothing is very impressionable and your best dining option is somewhere across the river in NYC. However, I think Court Street did a good job of providing a nice meal in a pleasant surrounding close to home.  You will be hard pressed to find a nicer brunch experience in Hoboken.  Court Street has a pretty, well-lit dining room that is just slightly less stuffy than Amanda's.  It's a good place to bring your parents when they are visiting from out of town, as the wait staff will not rush you out.  There are also plenty of menu options, and everyone at my table seemed pleased with their meals.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

More like a 3.5 (Yelp, seriously, get your shit together and include half-stars in your ratings).My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on Sunday (01/19) after being turned away at both Anthony David's and The Elysian Cafe. We were first told it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table, but after less than 3 minutes, we were escorted to a cozy two-seater in the dining room. Off to a good start.The restaurant's main dining area is comfortable and bright, with tables that are spaced close together but not directly next to each other, so you have some sense of privacy. As soon as we were seated, we were served two cups full of fresh fruit, which would have been fantastic if the fruits weren't honeydew and cantaloupe (two fruits I absolutely will not, cannot eat because they taste like bits of hard rubber dipped in talcum powder). NOTE TO ALL HOBOKEN EATERIES: Please include other, more delicious fruits on your menus, like berries or bananas or hell, even a plum or two. I don't care if it costs more, your patrons will thank you. Moving on...We had to wait a bit for our server, who sounded like she was getting over a cold. I don't think she gave us her name, either (although the receipt said, ""Laura L"", so we'll go with that). As she took our orders, we were given Court Street's complimentary Irish soda bread, which is also something I tend to stay away from because the flavor is either atrocious or non-existent. But Court Street got it right: the bread was firm, but not rock-hard, and it had a very pleasant, sweet and eggy taste overall, with the best part being the crust. I had to will myself not to eat more than one piece.I decided to order my usual brunch favorite (smoked salmon Benedict) with mimosa, and my boyfriend ordered French toast with maple syrup and coffee. We waited an unusually long time for our drinks, and I was surprised by the size of the glass Laura handed me. I'm used to sipping mimosas from thin champagne glasses, but she served it to me in what looked to be a 10-oz glass. I wasn't disappointed, but I had to wait until I had more food in my stomach before I began drinking (small person + too much liquor at once = giggly tipsiness). My boyfriend's coffee was served without ceremony in a plain white mug. No cream or milk was offered by our server. Puzzling, but he drank the coffee anyway and didn't mind the texture of it.My smoked salmon Benedict came with broccoli and roasted potato slices cut into little circles. It was good, not great. I liked how the broccoli was sauteed, and the potatoes were nicely done. I also tried a piece of my boyfriend's French toast and thought it was a little on the eggy side, but it was also good, and the maple syrup wasn't overly sweet. However, he had one complaint with the corned beef hash, which he felt was more like chopped/diced corned beef with a couple random pieces of cooked potatoes thrown in.We declined dessert (we were both pretty full by the time we finished) and left feeling mostly satisfied with our dining experience. Again, as I said earlier, the food was good, not terrific, but worth another try. Judging from the other reviews of this place, it seems as if the pre-fix dinner on weekdays and Lobsterfest in the summer are their main attractions. I'll have to stop by on a random work night and see if Court Street truly lives up to all the hype.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

127,ol5GnpgPYZKEtsjSRaGJMA,Jody G.,3.0 star rating,"A favorite place of my mother and brother who live in Hoboken, so a group of five of us went for our version of the ""family dinner"". Went at 5:45 because there's a prix fixe dinner menu before 6 weekdays... and we're that kind of family. $17.95 gets you three courses: appetizer, entree, and dessert . And, the menu is QUITE extensive. Plus there's good bread with butter (margerine?) and olive tampenade that I thought was overly processed, and curiously a little ""fishy"". My four dining companions LOVED their dishes. My 13 year old son ate every last bite of his beef burgandy and rated it ""excellent"", so I'm feeling like perhaps I ordered wrong. It started out well enough. The soup of the day, chilled tomato avacado (essentially gazpacho.... And EXCELLENT gazpacho at that) with chunks of avacado on top was the perfect summer soup. I could eat that soup every day and never tire of it!The entree, however, I tired of before I was a third of the way through. Angel hair pasta with grilled chicken in a tomato basil cream sauce. Maybe I should say CREAM sauce because it was so heavy and creamy I barely tasted anything else. The pasta was al dente (sometimes difficult with angel hair), but the chicken was VERY overcooked. I was sad when I watched my table-mates devour their dishes with such glee.On to dessert....... The usual cheese cakes and parfaits and brownie sundaes, but also the ""tart of the day""... made in house. This day it was apple and it was VERY good. Warm, sweet, but not too sweet.... with just a hint of almond paste in the crust.... and REAL whipped cream decorating the edges.

It's not in a location that's in your face like most restaurants on Washington Street. In other words, if you haven't been referred to Court Street or know it exists from yelping, you may never find it. And I like that aspect of this awesome bar and restaurant. What's so cool about it is it feels like an old-school bar when you walk in adorned with an oak bar, black and white framed pictures and TVs playing sports. Typical yet not trendy like most new bars in Hoboken. Eating in this area is okay as your two options are a bistro table and high seats or simply eating at the bar. But once you walk towards the back the experience changes exponentially. You walk into a cozy and classy dining area with ambient lighting, soft music, and white linen-clothed tables.

The menu is good, and there was a diverse and interesting selection of specials available when we went tonight. This was our second time there and both times we've sat in the bar, but the service was sloooooow.We got the beef carpaccio special app and liked it, and I got the arugula and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken, which was nothing special and really could have used more goat cheese. My boyfriend got the ribs and wasn't crazy about the way they were sauced. They were served with a small side of a beet mixed with mashed potatoes and sugar, as well as a side of mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower. I tried the beets and we were both surprised at how much we liked them. The last time we went a few years ago, we got steaks thought they were pretty good.We left around 10pm on a Friday night, and by the time we left, we were the youngest people left in the bar. Definitely an older crowd and a great place to grab a drink if you're looking to avoid the weekend Hoboken crowd.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
155,ABwttOy3qxZ2o33q7ICIog,Tom S.,3.0 star rating,"Been here twice now -- once for drinks and once for dinner. It's a great place for subdued drinks with a friend or date. Court Street is tucked away on... well, Court Street, so it's off the popularly-beaten path of Washington Street.Dinner here is good, but pretty basic. The menu is quite large, but it seems like typical pub fare -- burgers, salads, and entrees. My beef burgundy stew over egg noodles was hearty but plain. My friend's Popeye salad, however, came with a stunningly huge portion of chicken, which is rarely something you see anymore.I was looking forward to trying out the prix fixe menu, but we arrived at 6:10pm and the prix fixe ends at 6pm.

161,G4fEVpBjKyzdywIpOvAnrQ,Dan E.,2.0 star rating,"OK - the 2 stars might seem a little harsh but let me explain.  We had a reservation at Court Street on a Saturday night.  You enter at the bar and it's definitely a pretty nice place.  The bar area is a little more upscale than most bars in Hoboken and then the actual dining room is very nice.  Tablecloths, well kept, etc.  Not your average Hoboken restaurant/bar.  Service was pretty good throughout the meal.  No complaints from me there.  I was kind of looking forward to a burger, but Court House has a much more extensive dinner menu than I thought they would.  They actually have a huge seafood selection, and most of the people I was dining with decided on seafood so it kind of swayed my decision.  I went with the panko-encrusted center cut sushi tuna.  I'm a big fan of tuna so I had no problem going with that.  The tuna also came with a choice of potato and vegetables.  I also specified that I like my tuna rare (as it probably should be cooked).I was starving when we got here so I even started with an order of the french onion soup.  The french onion soup was very good.  I do think french onion is pretty standard no matter where you get it, but this one was solid.  The bread premeal was good, too.  It even came with some sort of olive tapenade that I thought was tasty.  I'm not even the biggest fan of olives, but I liked this one.  Along with some drinks from the bar, the meal was off to a pretty good start.I have to admit that my meal was pretty disappointing.  My tuna was way overcooked.  Even my wife said she noticed that.  Yes, I know I probably should have sent it back, but I was pretty hungry and didn't notice it immediately since it was crusted.  I guess I just had confidence that it would be cooked to near perfection.  It was also a fatty piece of tuna, so I kind of got the ""raw"" end of the deal on two sides (pun intended).  The potatoes and veggies that came with the dinner were also just OK.  I also have to say that the portions were pretty small.  My wife, who rarely ever finishes her meal, ate the entire thing (she had the crab cakes).  I did try a bite - they were good but definitely a little on the small side.  We also ordered dessert (yes, we went all out).  My wife and I split a piece of the chocolate cheesecake.  The chocolate cheesecake was very good - I was definitely impressed.  Unfortunately, it was the highlight of the meal.  I would definitely order it again.  It's kind of funny because the meal started well and ended well - it was just that my meal was a little on the disappointing side.I just can't give this place higher than a 2 star rating considering my meal and the place isn't cheap.  I would actually consider giving this place another shot, but I would definitely order something different.  If I do get back here and have a better experience, I will definitely update my review.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
162,xyeBTa1du0GZ92UtC_BlMg,Taryn C.,4.0 star rating,"By far one of my fave places to eat in Hoboken.  I used to live like a block and a half away from this place, and it never disappointed.  Their drink specials/menu, to food specials and even  their regular menu.  Wow.  I love their crab cakes.  They're not overly crabby or bread crumby.  It's almost like I am in the Midatlantic region.  I always get the mashed potatoes here but you usually get a veggie side and like this whipped beet mixture.  Amazing.  I've never had anything like it.  This is a great place for a sitdown meal. But as for other places in Hoboken, I've never been given a compelling reason why I should visit here for sports event or something.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
163,ZhRBIEqmRNrh9TLMWzIS6A,Matty G.,4.0 star rating,"I had been to this place once before a long time ago but I did not realize it until I walked into the place.  The last time I was here I ordered the fish and chips which I thought was excellent. This time I came because I heard that they will have the Red Sox game on in the bar area. They had that and much more and I think I have a place where I will officially return on a frequent basis.I got in there on a Friday night and found that the place was not too crowded and that there were seats still available at the bar. The bartender was wicked cool and and after finding out that him and I were Red Sox fans, he immediately hooked me up with my frist drink. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and when they were not busy with their tables they were joking and chatting with everyone at the bar. I have to say that everyone knowing everyone or just being friendly made the atmosphere that much better.The Yuengling that I ordered on draft came out to about $4 a glass which is not a bad price for the Hoboken area. The bar looked to have a large assortment of alcohol available, so I figure they can probably make a wide variety of drinks for you.Overall I gave this place a four star rating because of the more than friendly staff, the great atmosphere, and the price of food and drinks.  I plan on going back to this place again whether it will be to grab a bite to eat of a drink.

We were seated in the dining room in the back since the bar area is a bit tight for 4 people. I had the braised short rib special which was simply DELICIOUS. My mom had the duck breast special which she really liked, my dad had crab cakes that he said were really good, and my sister had a flat iron steak that she really enjoyed. Service was excellent from all the really friendly and attentive staff here at Court St. It really is a great little place just to have a drink at the bar or to sit down and have a quality meal in the restaurant side.

They always have tons on daily specials on top of their regular menu so there always something to please anyone in your group.   The homemade pies are super good and their meat dishes with sauces is my pick. I especially like their Monday night prime rib night for just $18! And it's Soo good. Comes with  soup or salad too. It is a really filling meal. The best part is always this red mashed beet or potato something that comes on most dinner plates.

199,lvkx5yqMQO9Isy_5-PJbIQ,John B.,5.0 star rating,Court Street is a gem of a restaurant tucked away on a quiet block in Hoboken.  I've lived in Hoboken for 10 years now and this is my absolute favorite place.  The staff is professional and attentive with very low turnover.  Many of the service staff have been there for years which is rare in the restaurant/ bar industry and says a lot about what a quality restaurant this is and what wonderful ownership it has.  I have been to Boston many times over the years and this restaurant's menu is the closest I have come across in the area to having the type of comfort foods I love.  Check out the daily specials on their website and you'll be impressed.  Hands down the best chicken pot pie I have had anywhere and I've even been to the UK.  They don't have the chicken pot pie every week as it rotates on the daily specials menu. I'm a burger kind of guy and their burgers are far better than many burger specific places.  If your looking for lobster look no further than here. I only wish they added New England Clam Chowder and  Lobster Roll to their menu and then I would feel complete.  Great place for a quiet & cozy evening for couples and families.,Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Tonight they were out of the lamb shank so I went for the osso buco, which was excellent.  The chorizo and shrimp appetizer was almost too much.  The lamb stew and the pasta were also good.  The Two Hands Gnarly Dudes Shiraz is outstanding and reasonably priced at $40.  Our son prefers the Hoegarten.Update 11/24/12: We keep coming back.  Tonight there were six of us including my brother, sister-in-law and nephew.  We had 6 different entrees (lamb stew, pot roast, beef bourginon, snapper, scallops and fettucini).  All were very good -- that's what I'm talking about!  Blueberry pie and profiteroles for dessert.  Two bottles of Gnarly Dudes (only $30 with the weekend wine special).Update 4/21/13: Finally made it for brunch.  It was great!  The croissant sandwiches and the omelet were very good -- tasty and plenty.  The mimosas were only $12 per pitcher, but mostly ice.Update 1/13/14: Long overdue update.  We've been there numerous times, but just went again for ""restaurant week"".  All the favorites still on the menu.  We ""mixed it up"" and had a Rolf Binder Grenache/Syrah (stick with the Two Hands).  Still our favorite!",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The lobster was astonishingly overcooked. Cooking lobster is easy. Screwing it up is difficult. Overcooking it destroys the flavor and texture of the meat. Get a kitchen timer. The seafood pasta was truly foul. The 'tomato marsala' sauce tasted like burnt ragu with too much dried oregano and no hint of marsala.  With that sauce base, its impossible to know how the seafood could have been had the sauce been even decent.

I followed with a ceasar salad that was also good. For my entree I had a shrimp and lobster dish that was served over papardelle. Now here's where it gets very good, this meal was outstanding! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the lobster was as tender as tender could be.They could have put my plate back on the shelf when I was done because it was licked clean!For desert the table shared a chocolate banana cake that was very nice.Our server was great with a very good sense of humor as we ribbed her a bit.

The bar is very nice and has a good feel to it, with arched windows all around and the right amount of dark wood. It can get really busy but still manages to feel initmate. The food and wine list are even better reasons to go. This place knows its wine. Not only does it have an extensive selection, but they do regular weekend wine tastings too. While some of the wines are costly (because they are top wines), the prices and mark-up really don't seem bad to me at all. I'd say the same about the food. The freshness is evident, they have people on staff who drive to NYC every day to buy fresh meats, fish, breads, shellfish, from the various marketplaces. Yet they manage to price things extremely well. Two 50 oz lobster tails for $31 bucks? Lovely steaks for less than $30 bucks? Veal dishes for $21 bucks? These prices are pretty standard for Hoboken and total bargains relative to NYC. Yet you are getting much better quality here.

230,_8GLCtTYuNbN1zM_yRsaUA,Rebecca S.,3.0 star rating,"A friend picked this restaurant for their diverse menu as the spot where we would celebrate her sister's impending nuptials. The bride-to-be is a vegetarian and some of the other attendants are picky eaters so the menu was perfect to suit the party-goers. Their menu is sizeable while remaining fairly priced and running the gamut from tasty appetizers to pastas, fresh fish to quesadillas. We passed on appetizers because we had all feasted on the complimentary bread and olive tapenade which was surprisingly tasteful. I started my meal with an arugula and goat cheese salad that was really good, the lemon garlic dressing was nice and light and was a nice contrast to the bite and peppery taste of the arugula. Dinner's ordered at the table ranged from short ribs to swai, and pasta with sweet sausage to chicken parmigiana. I had a portabella sandwich that I was less than thrilled with, the mozzarella cheese to mushroom proportion was out of whack so I felt like I was eating a cheese sandwich. There supposedly were roasted red peppers in the sandwich though they were sparsely intermingled. My meal was relatively bland, maybe if it had some kind of a balsamic sauce or some type of seasoning it would have been better. The reviews from around the table were all fairly positive though so maybe I was the only one with a lackluster dish. The restaurant itself is decently decorated. There is definitely room for improvement, but it has a nice cozy feel with floor to ceiling windows even if they do look out at the cobblestone alleyway. The setup is a little awkward as you have to walk through the bar to get to the dining room, the two rooms have completely different feels to them. The dining room at one point became excessively loud to the point that we were yelling to talk to each other and we were only a table of 6 seated 3 and 3 across from each other. The music wasn't loud and the bar was on the quiet side even with sporting events on the TV so I'm not sure how the noise elevated itself to such extreme level. All in all our time at Court Street was very pleasant, our waitress was fairly attentive given the number of tables that she had for the evening and my water glass was never empty which is a huge plus.

233,VXvDlQx4L0Ng3YHFS-7k2Q,Deb M.,2.0 star rating,"I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with our visit to Court Street.  First of all, though, I will tell you that it's lovely - a beautiful bar with some cozy 2-tops in the bar area, and a small, but very pretty dining room.  The menu is quite comprehensive and offers a little bit of everything.  The service was adequately attentive.  So that's the good.  The bad?  Everything we had was ridiculously underseasoned.  Lobster bisque was way too sweet (too much sherry?) and undersalted.  Hubby's beef burgundy required copious amounts of salt and pepper to produce any flavor.  Our daughter had pasta with olive oil and shrimp.  She said the pasta was flavorful, but the shrimp had no flavor at all.  Again, copious amounts of salt and pepper, which none of us have a tendency to add to anything.  I had a special puff pastry appetizer with crab, asparagus and fontina.  Mine was probably the most successful dish of the night.  However, it was served on a bed of arugula that was devoid of flavor and actually quite tough.  I guess I'm used to young arugula that offers a peppery bite, which would have been a nice counterpoint to the creamy puff pastry.  I wish restaurants would make the decision not to offer something if it is out of season and not up to par.  (Tomatoes are a perfect example.)  Just disappointing all around.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

There were a number of really good buys on their wine list. We dine here at least twice a month and you don't need a reservation, but you might need to wait maybe 20 mins to get a table if you go on a Fri/Sat night.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
235,pUIVEVr2FUhnUR6WBy9dWg,Allison M.,2.0 star rating,"Went here last night with a group of 6.  I had a pasta special of lobster and shrimp over angel hair with a lemon sauce.  The seafood was cooked well, but the sauce was completely bland and oily.  Yuck.  I think it would benefit them to simplify the menu and do only a few things well.  They don't quite know if they want to be a steakhouse, seafood joint, or something in between.  I probably won't go back.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

237,q4E78tFXCvmBLWJwfWzQaw,Rick K.,4.0 star rating,"Cozy and relaxing.Arrived somewhat late for dinner last night, no reservations. Though they had run out of two of the specials, they were apologetic and offered alternative suggestions.Though we were late, we weren't rushed. I had veal piccata which was well prepared and tasty. Ditto for wife's Shrimp and Lobster over angel hair pasta.   Entrees were preceded by mixed salad with caramelized walnuts and pears...very fresh andtasty.The wine list is outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed a wonderful Rioja Tempranillo and my wife had a lovely crisp Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. The choices are thoughtful, the ratings and descriptions are provided...and wine snobbery is absent. Prices are very reasonable.A great ending to a hectic day with staff that were courteous and helpful. Good food, great wine, nice staff. The room is smallish and the sports bar does break into applause, so not a quiet haven. But a large selection of well prepared upscale food in a relaxed and casual atmosphere will bring us back.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
238,oz7mN3hcR5iqq_FHfoHpmw,Alvin W.,4.0 star rating,If I was able to give a half star more I would. Everything I have ever ordered here have been good or very good. The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the fact they don't really do anything great!  Monday are the time I most frequent the bar for Prime Rib night.  I have been told by friends that I really need to check out Wednesday for the Lobster night.  The Saturday wine tastings and daily price fix dinners are some of the best deals in town.  The wine list in general is impressive for Hoboken and very reasonably priced.  There's a dining room in the back for larger larger groups but if I'm out by myself or with one other person I always end up eating at the bar or the tables buy the bar.,Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The food is always fresh and the large specials menu is always changing. They have everything from bar food to lobster and steak. The waitstaff and bartenders are a ton of fun and always bring the whole bar in to conversations. They have some of the best french onion soup I have ever tasted, even when I get take out. I also highly recommend the beef burgendy and the pot pie if you can catch it on the specials menu.",Court Street Restaurant & Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Seafood,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
