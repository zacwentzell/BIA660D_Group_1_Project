When I was there last week, I ordered a glass of Côtes du Rhône--Another delicious full-bodied red, perfect for the chilly weather.Union is a small, chic, and intimate establishment.

1,7R4S6DFxUKpqyxlPIeNyDQ,Vivian K.,4.0 star rating,"I had the chance to make a reservation for 3 people last minute (the night before actually) for a boozy brunch on Easter Sunday at 11:30am. This place is definitely a very trendy and hip place for young people, offering a great price for food and drinks. Overall, the food and the booze were great - fairly portioned dishes and generous amount of prosecco for the mimosa's. One thing I was a bit disappointed in was that we had to relocate to the bar. So the way that boozy brunch works at Union Bar and Kitchen is that you have 1.5 hours to have unlimited booze plus a main dish. Although I completely understand that the unlimited flow of booze was for max 1.5 hours (which I also believe is more than enough), we were not done with our final jug of mimosa when the unlimited flow of booze was up and our waitress asked us to move to the bar to finish it. She mentioned that there were a lot of people at the door waiting for their tables and that we had to give our table up to give to the next round of customers. I understand there was another round of customers coming in for their reservations, but when we relocated to the bar and saw that they put other guests at the table we sat at, there were still at least a few tables vacant (even until we finished our jug). This was the only thing that really disappointed me as the bar area seated a few people who were eating as well, while we were squished in the corner, not being able to sit comfortably.",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It was a good experience overall, but there definitely were somethings that could have made it better. My only advice is to make a reservation! Our group had one, but there were several parties who were deterred after hearing that the wait was over an hour. Don't be them!Our reservation was for 2:45 PM on a Sunday afternoon, which was only so since the majority of other time slots had already been booked for that specific Sunday. They seat only when the entire party is present, so be sure that everyone is there a few minutes beforehand, since the bottomless also starts at the time of your reservation.All of us opted in for the bottomless brunch option, which is $33 per person. Its also preferred that you pay cash for the brunch, but your also able to pay for it on one sole card if you'd like. I appreciate that they give you this options since most brunch places I've been to are strict ""cash only"" establishments here in the city. As for the drinks themselves you can choose from the standard mimosas or bloody mary's, but they also have bellini's which is a nice addition. I was able to try the mimosa and bellini and all I'll say is that they definitely pack a punch (in a good way).When it came time to order the food I ended up going with the breakfast burrito ($16 for the al la carte option) with a side of twice friend chili dusted french fries. I'm giving this review three starts because of the quality of this dish. The food was alright but definitely lacked some flavor and fell apart after I took my first bite.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially for us having such a big group. Our waiter was extremely attentive and constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything.We got the bottomless brunch (of course) which was only $33 for unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's, and bellini's PLUS an entree from the ""mains"" or ""eggs"" section of the menu, which is pretty much half of the menu and you have plenty to choose from. My fiancé and I are from Orlando and we were so impressed with this price because typically brunch in NYC is much more expensive, but this was a typical price for bottomless brunch where we're from.I got the breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg, and smoked gouda cheese) and my fiancé got the chicken and waffles. The sandwich was amazing but definitely hard to eat as a sandwich because it's huge. The chicken and waffles were delicious -- the waffles were so fluffy and soft and the breading on the chicken was very crispy and seasoned well. Make sure to get the french fries with your meal (they're perfectly crispy and have a little spice to them)! Also just to add to their customer service, when I was first trying to eat my breakfast sandwich I dropped an entire piece of bacon on the floor (and yes, I love my bacon and was so sad about this), and so I asked our waiter if I could get another piece and he came from the kitchen with one piece of bacon on a plate for me. I was so surprised because they had really good bacon and I was expecting to get a ""no"", but luckily, they brought me some more. Big thank you to Union Bar & Kitchen for that!

The restaurant itself is not very big, but they do manage to squeeze in large parties and provides quality service. Food is prepared relatively quickly as well. I love that there are mimosas, bellinis and bloody marys. When you get the bottomless brunch, you can intermix those drinks unlike some other bottomless brunch spots in New York.

My fiance ordered a burger that happened to be incredibly dry with stale-ish bread, so that put a damper on the meal, but again, when coming for a brunch the experience tends to weigh heavier than the meal.

Thursday afternoon, plenty of seating at the bar; quickly was handed the menu and got a rundown of what's available.For $24 - choice of sandwich/wrap, one side, and a drink. Settled on the Salmon ""Conbini"" Club with a side of Cheddar Jalapeño Buttermilk Biscuit Bites and a glass of Merlot. The sandwich is fairly large, the slices of bread encompassing a breaded salmon filet with a bunch of greens. A carb heavy sandwich that was a tad dry, but overall balanced flavor and a couple nice cuts of bacon. Biscuits are served with a flavored whipped butter, that helps the cornbread-like texture. Could have used more of the jalapeno kick (though a personal preference). Merlot is a solid accompaniment.Service here is fast; as I was in and out around 30 minutes.

It's smaller than I expected but handled A LOT of people on a Saturday afternoon.

Drinks were constantly refilled and served in carafes, so it was easy to fill up. The food was better than expected as well. A few of the aycd spots serve you dog meat (you're 10 drinks in by the time it comes), but it wasn't half bad here. Made my own omelet and it came out hot and as ordered. Bravo. Soundtrack of 90's-2000 jams led to some sing-alongs with the whole restaurant (sorry!) but was a pretty fun moment. Overall, a well played boozed up brunch from Union Bar.

Thanks to all the Yelp reviews I am glad we came! We arrived around 12:30ish for brunch and hostess said there wasn't any available tables until after 2pm, I believe they take reservations. Luckily there was seats at the bar and we were perfectly fine with sitting there because the bartenders were extremely nice and gave us suggestion on things to do and see in NYC.The restaurant is small so it gets pretty crowded and loud but that is expected especially during brunch. There is also a DJ (the bartender) playing really good music! We enjoyed his throwback/90s/current hits mix lol.We opted for the bottomless brunch option which included mimosas, Bellini's or bloody Mary's for 1.5 hours, 1 main entrée and a side for only $33. It was a great deal in my opinion and I drank my moneys work of the Bellini's which were very strong, at least for me lol. The food was ok for but the portions were very generous. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with a side of mixed fruit. Surprisingly the fruit was my favorite part of the meal. Being a southerner the fried chicken wasn't seasoned and was not the right cut of chicken in my opinion. My friend order the breakfast sandwich with thick cut bacon, was really big and agreed the food was just ok. We enjoyed the atmosphere because it was a younger chill crowd.

Service was very attentive and super friendly; we made our reservation for 1:30 and didn't leave until after 5! I can see during peak hours of brunch they will try to keep tables to their time limit, but if you go towards the end of brunch, they really don't rush you and may even be willing to slightly extend the time limit on your bottomless brunch (again, it seems to depend on how busy they are - during the winter it may be less busier than during the warmer months!).",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

He came to us before we needed him for anything - totally on point.As for food, not great but not bad either. Let me just put it this way, if you're coming here for brunch, it's for the bottomless brunch drinks, not the food.If you decide to come, be sure to make a reservation (doesn't have to be for a large party).

The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially for us having such a big group. Our waiter was extremely attentive and constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything.We got the bottomless brunch (of course) which was only $33 for unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's, and bellini's PLUS an entree from the ""mains"" or ""eggs"" section of the menu, which is pretty much half of the menu and you have plenty to choose from. My fiancé and I are from Orlando and we were so impressed with this price because typically brunch in NYC is much more expensive, but this was a typical price for bottomless brunch where we're from.I got the breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg, and smoked gouda cheese) and my fiancé got the chicken and waffles. The sandwich was amazing but definitely hard to eat as a sandwich because it's huge. The chicken and waffles were delicious -- the waffles were so fluffy and soft and the breading on the chicken was very crispy and seasoned well. Make sure to get the french fries with your meal (they're perfectly crispy and have a little spice to them)! Also just to add to their customer service, when I was first trying to eat my breakfast sandwich I dropped an entire piece of bacon on the floor (and yes, I love my bacon and was so sad about this), and so I asked our waiter if I could get another piece and he came from the kitchen with one piece of bacon on a plate for me. I was so surprised because they had really good bacon and I was expecting to get a ""no"", but luckily, they brought me some more. Big thank you to Union Bar & Kitchen for that! Overall, we were so happy with Union Bar & Kitchen. The food, service, and atmosphere was great.

The restaurant itself is not very big, but they do manage to squeeze in large parties and provides quality service. Food is prepared relatively quickly as well. I love that there are mimosas, bellinis and bloody marys. When you get the bottomless brunch, you can intermix those drinks unlike some other bottomless brunch spots in New York.

My fiance ordered a burger that happened to be incredibly dry with stale-ish bread, so that put a damper on the meal, but again, when coming for a brunch the experience tends to weigh heavier than the meal.

Thursday afternoon, plenty of seating at the bar; quickly was handed the menu and got a rundown of what's available.For $24 - choice of sandwich/wrap, one side, and a drink. Settled on the Salmon ""Conbini"" Club with a side of Cheddar Jalapeño Buttermilk Biscuit Bites and a glass of Merlot. The sandwich is fairly large, the slices of bread encompassing a breaded salmon filet with a bunch of greens. A carb heavy sandwich that was a tad dry, but overall balanced flavor and a couple nice cuts of bacon. Biscuits are served with a flavored whipped butter, that helps the cornbread-like texture. Could have used more of the jalapeno kick (though a personal preference). Merlot is a solid accompaniment.Service here is fast; as I was in and out around 30 minutes.

It's smaller than I expected but handled A LOT of people on a Saturday afternoon. Though we were delayed to sit at our table, the bartenders flipped the switch to ON and started our open bar while we were waiting. Bless you, Sir. While seated, the service was great. Drinks were constantly refilled and served in carafes, so it was easy to fill up. The food was better than expected as well. A few of the aycd spots serve you dog meat (you're 10 drinks in by the time it comes), but it wasn't half bad here. Made my own omelet and it came out hot and as ordered. Bravo. Soundtrack of 90's-2000 jams led to some sing-alongs with the whole restaurant (sorry!) but was a pretty fun moment. Overall, a well played boozed up brunch from Union Bar.

Thanks to all the Yelp reviews I am glad we came! We arrived around 12:30ish for brunch and hostess said there wasn't any available tables until after 2pm, I believe they take reservations. Luckily there was seats at the bar and we were perfectly fine with sitting there because the bartenders were extremely nice and gave us suggestion on things to do and see in NYC.The restaurant is small so it gets pretty crowded and loud but that is expected especially during brunch. There is also a DJ (the bartender) playing really good music! We enjoyed his throwback/90s/current hits mix lol.We opted for the bottomless brunch option which included mimosas, Bellini's or bloody Mary's for 1.5 hours, 1 main entrée and a side for only $33. It was a great deal in my opinion and I drank my moneys work of the Bellini's which were very strong, at least for me lol. The food was ok for but the portions were very generous. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with a side of mixed fruit. Surprisingly the fruit was my favorite part of the meal. Being a southerner the fried chicken wasn't seasoned and was not the right cut of chicken in my opinion. My friend order the breakfast sandwich with thick cut bacon, was really big and agreed the food was just ok. We enjoyed the atmosphere because it was a younger chill crowd.

Service was very attentive and super friendly; we made our reservation for 1:30 and didn't leave until after 5! I can see during peak hours of brunch they will try to keep tables to their time limit, but if you go towards the end of brunch, they really don't rush you and may even be willing to slightly extend the time limit on your bottomless brunch (again, it seems to depend on how busy they are - during the winter it may be less busier than during the warmer months!).",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

A great mix of Hip hop/Top 40's and throwbacks!I like that Union has different options for reserving your table. You can choose bar seating, high tables, or seated tables. When making a reservation I was a bit puzzled but it makes sense once you get to the restaurant. $33 for all you can drink brunch (mimosas, Bellini's, or bloody Mary). I wasn't blown away by the food options; they are your standard American brunch chx & waffles, various omelettes, steak & eggs (for an upcharge), burgers (toppings are all additional $), etc. and the food won't be remembered much. I had to dress up my burger like a baby's first Christmas photo so I definitely wouldn't recommend it. I'm talking salt, pepper, hot sauce, asking for more onions, then rearranging it all because it was just... tasteless :(. However the service was great, smiling faces and attentive hosts and waiters. This is a small establishment and did get cramped near the entrance since people were at the bar watching the game but a host sat us after we flagged 'em down.

I must say first off they were super accommodating, since my whole party was 35 minutes late for our reservation! FYI, weekend train service sucks plan accordingly! We were told when making the reservation that the brunch really starts to get poppin at 3:30/4, so be not afraid to make a ressie a bit later. We were finally seated at 4:30 PM (org res time was 3:45 PM) and although it was more of a dinner at that point (lol) we dove right into brunch. We did the ""bottomless brunch"" you can select your meal from the eggs & main side of the menu; selection is good. The drinks offered with bottomless are mimosa, bellinis, and bloody marys.We ordered a carafe of mimosa, bellini, and my friend and I got the bloody mary. I would suggest going with the mimosa or bellini, the bloody is okay, but not something I could have sipped on all brunch, I switched after my first. The service was steady, our water glasses were filled regularly and our carafes were replaced when low. The place is not big at all it's a square shape with high top, bar and table seating; you always have eyes on the servers so you can flag someone down if needed. The drinks weren't super strong, which is common for brunch, but with the amount of carafes they give us eventually you will start feeling it so no complaints. The food took about 20 minutes to come out which was not bad at all since we were a large group, I got the breakfast burrito, it was delish, not gigantic so don't be intimidated by it, I was able to finish it all. It came with a choice of home fries, french fries, or a house salad. I went with the home fries and they mediocre, could have been cooked a little bit more and hotter (I love my food hot), I would go with the french fries next time. Everyone else loved their food, except the fried chicken, my friend ordered it and it was a bit over fried. Jeremy sat us he was a fun/lively guy. Tony was our server and he was super sweet and helpful. Mike made sure our glasses were never empty and gave us great recos of bars to check out in the area. We pretty much closed the place out for brunch and were hanging with the staff until they kindly told us they were closing up to clean for the dinner/night crowd. Gratuity was included in the bill for my party it came out to $42 in change. Overall a super fun brunch paired with good hip hop/pop from today and yesterday.

Everything else was amazing and I loved it.Initially we had to wait a few because we didn't make reservations and they seem to have a lot of regulars who make reservations on the weekend. We were seated and informed about the Endless brunch deal that was 33$ a person and included drinks for 1.5 hours. I chose to do it but my bf opted out. We decided to do the 3 for $15 small plates and I fell in love with the UBK slider --amazing! The breakfast burrito I could pass on but the french toast sandwiches were yummy.I got my own carafe of mimosa all to myself :) and I ordered the chicken and waffles while my bf ordered the challah french toast and a side of bacon. I was really disappointed in the chicken and waffles. I consider myself a connoisseur of all things chicken and waffles and theirs is just wrong. From the soggy dark meat chicken breasts that tasted like sausage to the ridiculously thick and super fluffy waffles. The challah french toast was sooooooo good!! It really tasted like a sweet toasted croissant covered in syrup -- loved it! All in all, I would come back if I was in the area because now I know what I love and dislike. The boozy brunch option is cool if you're with a group and are staying in the area.

With a nice inside space and small outside dining area on the sidewalk, it's a great option for any time of the year, but even better in the summer.Having been here a couple of times, I've had a few different dishes. That standouts were the black bean soup (which I think is a special) and the salmon club sandwich. The soup was good, but I found it to be just a little on the salty side. Portion wise though, the cup is more than large enough if having with another dish. The salmon club was very good. Hadn't had that combo before but really enjoyed it. Salmon wasn't over cooked and mixed surprisingly well with the bacon, lettuce and tomato. All in all, a great sandwich.This is also a cool place to come for happy hour as they have good specials and a pretty cool scene. It does get pretty crowded however.

We shared a pitcher of Mimosas and I got the avocado toast with smoked salmon as my entree. I was iffy about getting this but it ended up being really good! I'm picky with my salmon because I hate when it's too fishy. Not the case at Union! It also came with a side of fries which was delicious. My other friends got the salmon platter and the fried chicken and waffles. They both loved their food as well. I tried the chicken which was tender and the waffles were fluffy. We also got a side of truffle mac and cheese to share for the table. I've definitely had better but I'm not sure if it's because I was too full to enjoy it.

It wasn't awful, I just wouldn't order it again. My co-workers got the fish tacos and the mushroom wraps.

Have no idea about their brunch. Came here with some coworkers. We sat outside, lovely day, and decided to take advantage of their $24 lunch deal, beer or wine/side/sandwich or burger. The menu looked amazing. I drooled just thinking about that truffled mac and cheese. Maybe I hyped myself up too much which lead to the disappointment. Beer selection is fine. Wine was whatever. I don't expect much when you are getting these lunch deals in terms of alcohol. Any deal sounds good to me.Collectively we had the chicken sammy, santa fe wrap, salmon club and fish tacos as mains and for sides we tried the rosemary fries, cauliflower, brussels sprouts with bacon, and mac and cheese. Surprisingly despite the wonderful descriptions the mains were all lacking any sort of seasoning and were very very dry. I wouldn't normally care but it just felt so disappointing considering we were paying a decent amount of money for this. Everyone shared this same sentiment. At least the sides were decent, though nothing I'd go crazy about.Our server was great and beer is beer so hard to really screw that up. But the mains were so lacking. We just moved offices into this area and were in search for a new favorite spot for lunch. This sadly was not it.

The place is super cute and clean, servers are attentive and very friendly, music is bumpin and most importantly, the food is actually delicious. Many of the bottomless brunch places in the city fall short because their food is just not up to par of the price of the bottomless brunch. However, the bottomless brunch at UBK is not only affordable and fair, the food is outstanding. My friend and I both did bottomless for mimosas and we were each given our glasses and a carafe of the mimosas were brought over a few minutes later. This was nice as we did not have to constantly ask for refills. Our carafe was promptly replaced anytime it was running dangerously low. We both ordered the chicken and waffles and I made my waffles chocolate chip. This dish was SO good. The chicken was hot, crispy yet juicy and tender on the inside. The waffles were crispy yet soft on this inside as well. The chocolate chips were a great touch- I am a huge sucker for salty and sweet so this dish is just made for me. The portion is super generous and I would've finished it if I was able to just go home and ride out the food coma I would've gotten. Also, our bottomless time hadn't been up yet but our table was needed for another party so our server actually sat us outside and let us have even more time with our drinks and never bothered us once to leave. My only qualm would be that it DOES get preeetty loud inside. The music gets really loud so people are screaming to talk to each other.

Finally I asked what was going on and they said ""There was a large group ahead of you. That is why it is taking so long."" I found this to be a suspect excuse. If this was the case, someone should have come out and said this to us in advance. The restaurant was 1/3 full. Many open tables. It is hard to believe that is what affected our food arrival time. The food arrived and it was good.. (A little overcooked or sitting under the warmer). With so much competition in NYC, I would not go back. The funny thing is, it wouldn't have taken much for our group to be happy. 1. I was ordering seltzer as a drink. They could have taken the $4 per seltzer off the bill (this was insane for seltzer)2.

And today was the day that I automatically got my wish granted, as their wonderfully marinated , perfectly fried chicken Is indeed boneless. No worries about wasting any delicious, precious meat. While the chicken was flavorful, the high salt content was starting to get to me after a while. The waffles were not as crispy as I had thought but they were good. The next time, I'll probably get the chocolate chip waffles so that there's that nice sweet and salty contrast going on. On the side, I had the house salad. The vinaigrette was too tangy and acrid for me. The bottomless brunch deal is a great find, bc for only 33ish, you get the entree and bottomless drinks for 1.5 hours.

Tall ceilings and great lighting. We ended up with a great table by the front windows. Next, the bottomless brunch. With a purchase of any item under eggs or mains, it includes a 2 hour limit with bloodys, mimosas, and belinis for $33. The service was very attentive to our needs and kept up with the 2 hour limit.

Interior is kind of a hybrid halfway between bar and brunch spot. At $39, the 2 hour bottomless brunch is a very solid deal. The bellinis and mimosas were made well (at least for bottomless) and the food was superb.Mains:Sirloin burger: their version of a breakfast burger, cooked to specifications, side of rosemary fries were even betterThe morning after: basically a breakfast sandwich with a crispy fried pork cutlet with some dope additions.

I ordered the Morning After Sandwich, which sounded really delicious in theory, but when it showed up, the pork katsu wasn't crispy anymore and the whole sandwich was a little soggy and cold. The rosemary fries were the only part of the food I actually enjoyed. Although the food did not impress me, I will say the bottomless brunch is a great deal. For only $10-15 more than an entree, you can get all-you-can-drink bellinis, mimosas, and bloody Mary's.

100,Qf5tKXQPo3AcNk4EtNKA4Q,Nia N.,3.0 star rating,"Minus 2 stars for the A-Ok food.I recently visited the Union Bar & Kitchen to celebrate my birthday with brunch. Booking the reservation in advance went very smoothly from two weeks before the event to an hour before when i had to suddenly change the time of arrival and number of guests. I even arrived after my set time, but my table was still reserved for my party and we weren't penalized on our time.Service wise-I understand brunch on a Sunday in NYC is going to be crowded and loud however, when i was seated, i noticed that the table was not set (lacking eating utensils, napkins, and condiments). It was also difficult to catch the attention of a server at first but after about 20 minutes in, we were given water and placed our orders for the first round of mimosas. For the remainder of the brunch, our server Shane was very helpful and timely with our requests for more mimosas and beelines (I mean it is a bottomless brunch after all )Food  & Drinks-The brunch costs $33pp with the exception of additional food items and they only accept cash or one card for the table. NBD. The drinks were strong- mimosas had too much pulp for me though but i endured it. I later switched over to the peach bellini, which ended up being the drink choice of the afternoon. For food, I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of bacon. The waffles were good. The chicken, though, yuck! Im not sure if it was even seasoned or cooked thoroughly. It lacked taste, was overly breaded and simply didn't taste like chicken. When i asked my other friends who ordered the same as I, they said likewise. At that point, I wasn't much interested in the main meal anymore but kept on drinking. My other friends had the poached egg with salmon combo and burgers. They enjoyed their meal. Atmosphere-Union is located in a very industrial area of Soho and if you blink, you may miss it. The interior was very chic, artsy and gave me a good vibe. The music, although very loud, was great! Shout out to the DJ or aux cord handler lol. Because Sunday brunch in the afternoon is the busiest time for them, there was a lot of people but with my large group, we were on top of each other. In all, I would come back to the Union Kitchen but I wouldn't order the same meal.

Food and drinks are delicious and what really sets it apart is the spectacular customer service. Other spots need to take note because UBK knows how to run a business.Came here for my birthday brunch with a party of 15. We got the high top table in the middle. I loved the music (top 40) and there was enough standing room by the bar for photos and hanging out afterwards. Our server Naseem was great. He was very thoughtful, and I like how they give you carafes at your table for you to refill at your own pace, and they were very attentive so that you really get your money's worth for the 1.5 hour of bottomless. What I hate about a lot of other bottomless brunch places is that you have to wait for the server to refill your drink, and so if you're lucky you'll maybe get 3-4 drinks in before they kick you out..this definitely wasn't a problem at UBK. I ordered the avocado toast, which came with smoked salmon and mango! I've never had avo toast with mango but it was surprisingly tasty. I wish I got to eat more of it...but I was too busy celebrating. Also I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shoutout to Alex at the bar. He was the MVP. Brendon, the General Manager, was very helpful afterwards via email when I wanted an itemized receipt and sent me a refund for something I was overcharged for.I will be back. I had a blast.

120,e3QkfdpttBYP0DLehxYPQw,Ingrid S.,3.0 star rating,"I had initially heard about Union Bar and Kitchen through Yelp. Obviously. Duh. But I think an elite event was hosted here awhile back and I hadn't gotten into that particular one. Was intrigued, looked at their menu, a bit pricey, but they have a solid happy hour: 4-7pm Mon-Friday: $5 Select beer/$6 select wine/$3 pork belly sliders/$2 Fried Clams/$1.50 Oysters,$1 Clams on the half shell. Also, Unlimited boozey brunch with your entree for $33. Unfortunately, I didn't come for any of those awesome deals. I came because my friend was in town for the 5 borough bike tour race in the city with her SlowRoll bike group from Detroit. They picked the place and for a Saturday night, it isn't very cheap or really worth its value. The ambiance here is pretty nice. It's sleek and modern with high ceilings and I have to admit that they accommodated very nicely an enormous group. Especially I like that right from the start the waiter announced he was taking a separate card from everyone to keep things simple at the end. I LOVE this. EVERYONE should ALWAYS be placed on a separate check. Though, there was an awkward moment as one lady from their group didn't own a credit card or believed in having those shiny things. Left an awkward tension as she tried to explain this to a waiter in disbelief. Appetizers came out. I didn't order any but was hurled some food my way to sample. The jalapeno cheddar buttermilk biscuits are to die for. Best thing I ate all night. They are warm, cheesy, just a hint of spice and not over-whelming and smeared with a whipped creamy butter - heaven. Frizzled onions with ghost pepper mayo - Tasty but legit burn your mouth off spicy. The fried onions are addicting tasting. Chips and guacamole - the chips are kind of bougie. They have that fancy pita chip-like quality as opposed to tortilla. The guac was good but nothing memorable and very bland. If you like flavorless guacamole, which a lot of people do, its right up your alley. My entree - I was torn between trying their truffle mac and cheese with bacon, but I had had enough dairy that weekend and went with their UBK Sirloin Brisket Burger. It was served on a way too toasted top of an english muffin with an incredibly soggy bottom, gouda cheese that wasn't melted at all and more like a cold shaved off hard piece of cheese, tomato, and copious amounts of iceberg lettuce with no sauce. This could have used a sauce. The beef was unctuous and dripping with juices but also not cooked how I ordered it, leaving me feeling incredibly disappointed. They ruined the beef. This cattle should have been medium rare and bleeding but was medium well. The best part of the entree honestly were their twice fried chili rosemary fries. They were good but also kind of disappointing as well. I've had twice fried fries a few times. The most notable are the crack fries served up at HopCat in Detroit. But I barely tasted the rosemary, barely tasted any chili flavoring. Texture was nice and not too greasy but just not a great double dipped fry, my friends.Some kinks to work out here. My friend's fish tacos (while being a copious amount of fish) for two tacos and a side of beans/guac its a $20 entree. You read that right. $20 for 2 tacos. Snaps self back to reality. I'm not a fan either of a forced gratuity tip on the end. It's kind of tacky. Also, they don't warn you of already adding the tip to your bill. I'd come back maybe some day to try their happy hour or brunch. But with the food just being meh and their beer selection being unattractive, which I haven't mentioned yet being not incredibly exciting and nothing cheaper than $8-9 on non-happy hour prices, it's hard to convince me to give this place a second chance.",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Jeremy was our server and was super attentive to our needs. Always bringing us water, drinks, and even brought us an after dinner lemon drop shot at the end. Food - 5 stars: We started with the smoked trout deviled eggs and the fried oysters, both of which were amazing. For the mains we had the scallops and the salmon tartar. The scallops came with THE BEST pesto rice risotto that I could not stop eating. The Salmon tartar came with homemade chips that were super crispy and delicious. We got the Brussels sprouts with bacon and Moroccan chickpeas for sides - both of which were cooked perfectly. We finished with an amazing Irish coffee and cheesecake.

We enjoyed very good oysters though - we had a dozen at $1.50 each so you can't really beat that price, plus it wasn't fishy. They had select $6 wines and $5 beers. Their menus look very good, but I think they're on the pricier end, however I would love to come back to find out how good their main entrees taste like!

I attended a fantastic Elite event about a month ago and I was eager to return for more delicious food. I made a reservation for 3 people on a Saturday at 1 PM through OpenTable - easy. But when my friends and I showed up at around 1:06, I was told that another customer had accidentally taken my reservation. What the what?! According to the host, apparently someone else had told him they're ""sometimes referred to as 'G'"". Okay, but my reservation was under Gab Rose. While I reeled from this unprofessional move on the part of UBK, we were delegated to a high table in the back that didn't really fit all three of us. We were told to wait until the tables next to us cleared, which we did, and they pushed one over and added a third setting. We barely received an apology and I think the right move would have been to move the people who stole our reservation, rather than cramping us in the back after this mistake. On top of that, the service was really slow. There seemed to be two people running the place and it took about 20 minutes to even receive menus. I will say the food is very good. We split a bunch of small plates: eggs Benedict with salmon, breakfast quesadilla (OMG, that guac was the best), mini chocolate chip pancakes and both types of french toast, plus fries. I also had some excellent iced coffee. It's a shame about the service, or I would totally have given 4-5 stars for the food.

We wanted to order more raw oysters but they ran out. We at least had 10 raw oysters. The rosemary fries was a big hit. My friend ordered the deviled eggs, unsure what her thoughts were. For dessert, we had the molten lava chocolate cake with basil ice cream. It was soooooooooooooo delicious!  The owner was very nice to come by and ask us how we were enjoying the food/drinks.

First, the restaurant is really aesthetically pleasing.  It is clean, gets good light, lots of windows, and the patrons were quite beautiful.  We had a table that accommodated a party of 10. The mimosas were flowing and some of my friends kindly explained to the waiter that it was my birthday.  Our waiter was super busy, but still took great care of us.  Since our waiter was busy and the floor appeared to be a bit understaffed, the bartender, Ryan was kind enough to check on us occasionally as well. I really appreciated this gesture because it made us, especially me, feel very special because they said they wanted me to enjoy my birthday.4 of us ordered the chicken and waffles, it was divine! This was the first time I had ever had chicken and waffles where the chicken was boneless, which I won't lie, made me slightly uncomfortable at first, but the foodie in me, was definitely satisfied.Ryan and our waiter offered us the option to move to the higher table because another party needed our table, but they said they wanted us to continue to celebrate. We were really impressed with being offered this option, most restaurants would just ask you to get up and leave.

For starters, it's refreshing to find a good brunch place that isn't in the ruckus of Meatpacking. This location in SoHo is more quiet on a weekend for brunch.The decor is nice with its high ceilings and bar-esque/kitchen feel. The food was very solid. UBK does the brunch essentials such as omelettes and benedict's just right. They even have some unique dishes. I don't recall the name of what I ordered, but combining pork, ginger, bbq, and eggs is different. When it tastes good, that's impressive. This place has a bottomless beverage option. Unlike many places that serve poorly made drinks during bottomless brunch, UBK made actual drinks with each serving. The Bloody Mary's are spicy and tasty. The Bellini's are sweet and filling. And the mimosa is simple and basic, but tasted as if the orange juice was fresh squeezed.

This was my first time at a bottomless brunch in the city and it lived up to its hype. I went at 1pm on Saturday with a group of 6 and since we had reservations beforehand the wait was not long. I still craved for brunch style but was also getting hungry since it was later in the day so I ordered a Ubk Sirloin Burger with avocado, bacon and fried egg & it was the perfect plate that had a runny yolk and fries on the side. Not only was the food great but the service was just as good.

Rolled tacos and Japanese inspired fried chicken... not sure how they're described on the menu, but both were delicious.  Moving on to the main; I went with the - surf and turf and each bite was so good I found myself compelled to sit and appreciate the depth of flavors before going back for another. Perfectly cooked NY strip paired with chili dusted shrimp.  The sides were fantastic as well; twice fried chili-rosemary fries, shaved Brussels sprouts and truffle bacon mac n cheese...The menu is interesting, well thought out and absolutely delicious!  Thank you Jonathon for a fantastic dinner.  The next time I'm in NYC I'll definitely be returning to UBK!!!",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We had a group of 16 people but ended up splitting up bc we were given a high top table in the middle but had two kids in strollers. Not a big deal, but there were two other large parties very deeply entrenched in the bottomless drinks. Most of us opted out to have speciality cocktails instead. I highly recommend the drink ""our American cousin"" which had vodka and peach purée. There were lots of different ages, and the music selection was very fun. Be prepared to yell across the table to your friends to have a conversation. The brunch menu was great and I would recommend the omelette, avocado toast, and steak and eggs. The chicken and waffles were not as great as I would have hoped since the chicken was thickly breaded and not much meat inside. The homemade syrup on the waffles was its saving grace.

Three Braised Pork Belly Sliders, each done a different way and each featuring flavor combinations that were better than the last! Salmon Tartar with Fresh Tortilla Chips... nothing special but very nice. Watermelon Gazpacho... WOW... perfect blend of sweet and heat. Frizzled Onions... the star here is the ""ghost pepper mayo"" just on the edge of hot. Wow this place really understands balance!! Fried Oysters... sublime.

The atmosphere in UBK was lively and fun, a ton of groups getting brunch, celebrating birthdays, etc. Definitely a place you wanted to be on a Saturday with your friends in a cool area.

I guess it helps that they aren't in a very heavily congested area in terms of foot traffic because the Happy Hour crowd around 5:15 was a bit light, but it was also to our advantage because we got to pig out on some deliciously shucked Blue Point Oysters for $1... Yes, a, dollar. We then ordered the fried oysters for $2 (happy hour pricing) and they were pretty delicious. They have some sort of tartar sauce underneath them which makes them even tastier. Finally, the pork belly sweet BBQ sliders ($2) were REALLY good. They have an incredible avocado slaw and the jalapeño gives it just the right touch. The chef came out personally to chat with everyone which was a nice touch. He's a little insane, but a little insane make a great dish, and like most artists, he takes pride in his work. Also, I forgot to mention that the Happy Hour draft beers were $4 and the $5 Sauvignon blanc was some of the best picked wine I've tasted for a Happy Hour.

We noticed Union Bar & Kitchen as we walked by, and thought we were about to discover one of NYC's hidden gems, as it is fairly new but has a 4.5 star Yelp rating-- boy were we wrong. I have had VERY few poor dining experiences in NYC, and this was one of them. We were craving fresh squeezed orange juice, and while we were perplexed by the $6 price, we went ahead and ordered. The first thing we noticed was that it had ice. What fresh squeezed Oj has ice?? The second thing we noticed, was that it tasted worse than what is typically served on a flight. Fresh squeezed? LIES. It wasn't even Tropicana. How disappointing. The chef/waiter handed by friend a scolding hot plate that almost burned her hands, a plate that had a different side than what she ordered. The staff seemed flustered and confused, even though there were only three full tables in the empty restaurant and messed up our order. The ambiance, with women's bowling playing on the tv in the background, was sterile and unwelcoming. The food itself was less than average. Brunch is easy to master, especially in NYC, but man, this did not satisfy our hungover cravings. In fact, we had to stop by Dominique Ansel's bakery after to redeem our taste buds. I am convinced that the 30 previous Yelp reviews raving about this restaurant were staged. As are the professional-grade photographs of the food, which absolutely DO NOT appear as pictured.

There is also a great selection of Tequila and Scotch behind the bar.The waitstaff and bartenders are friendly, welcoming and generally great. The crowd is lively with conversations in every corner of the bar and restaurant making for a great atmosphere. It's the kind of place where people seem to feel at home, and come to meet up with friends and have a good time. I've been going to UBK for close to a year and it keeps getting better. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I've gotta say, the person who wrote some drivel about bugs and an issue with the wine must have some psychological issue or is writing on behalf of a classless competitor. These things couldn't be further from the truth. The place is beyond clean, the food is perfectly and professionally presented and the wine list is incredibly curated with a separate reserve bottle list that rivals that of some of NYC's top restaurants. To criticize a place with stunning California Cabs and First Growth Bordeaux on their list for not knowing what Chardonnay is.... is... well frankly... comical and shows the reviewer's pathetic bias. What a joke. It's too bad that someone like that is permitted to post reviews.",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Although the drink itself wasn't all that exciting, we ordered several items off their food menu that were amazing. I'm looking at you, truffled mac and cheese. And jalapeno cheddar biscuits, I will make room for you in my belly any time. In fact, I'm craving their food right now as I write this review. The only disappointing thing was the dessert we ordered (a banana chocolate empanada), but the rest of the food more than made up for that. I'd definitely go back there.",Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The staff (we had multiple waiters come outside, which was entertaining albeit somewhat inefficient) were friendly and made recommendations for dinner.

It was good though - fresh grilled shrimp served alongside a very cheesy piece of toasted bread. My wife loved her breakfast wrap though. It definitely looked more exciting, and reminded me of a California breakfast burrito. This is a nice addition to the area.

Maybe i am being sensitive but i am tired of being told ""no"" at restaurants for simple requests. Case in point. Asked for coffee here at brunch. Response, ""we don't serve coffee. You can have espresso or a latte"". I'm just tired of stuff like this. You have all the tools, talent and the ingredients, take the swizzle stick out of your ass and make coffee.  It twisted the knife for me when the table next to requested bread. Response, ""we don't serve bread but for $xx we offer our flat bread.""The quesadilla was bland and unappealing. The mini benedicts were ok but i'd prefer a classic option. The mini french toasts i was most excited for were terrible. Very dry and the strawberry ones had two 2-millimeter think slices of strawberry. As in one strawberry probably lasts them 4-5 orders. It wasn't all bad though. The portobello cap and parfait were both top notch. The location and decor for me are wonderful, its in the neighborhood but away from tourists.

I came here to celebrate two of my friends birthday dinner and they both enjoyed every moment. Our server Jeremy made us feel like family. He guided us through the menu and his choices were spot on. Every dish that came to the table, I literally couldn't stop myself from drooling. From the 3 sausages, to the calamari and the bacon wrapped asparagus. I had the oven roasted chicken that pretty much melted in my mouth. My hat goes off to Chef John for blessing our tastebuds with one of his weekly specials, the pork chops (Hands down the best I've ever eaten). Make sure you do not forget about dessert. The Oreo Chimichangas with vanilla ice cream, was so good I think I was crying happy tears. UBK is an NYC must go.

We were the only table there in the middle of lunch hour which was surprising. Hope to bring these guys more business from my office. Two distractions from our lunch meeting as we were conducting business was the uneven table which the waitress tried to fix but we just ended up switching tables and the constant flies - they had opened all the front doors so the restaurant was wide open since it was such a nice day but those flies kept zooming right into the restaurant.,Union Bar & Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
