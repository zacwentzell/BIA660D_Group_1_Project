1,0Eoarz5CiJy91j0uRDDaog,Edith L.,1.0 star rating,Today was our second time visiting this restaurant our first experience was very good very pleasant the waiter was very nice zero complaints so saddened that I can't say the same thing about our second time was as good as our first time we had different waiter and of course the experience was very different- food was good. Even though we felt like waiter was harassing us to order more drinks or food didn't like that at all. So when it was time to pay we divided the bill in 3 so we tipped the waiter $45 tip which I think was fine but he came back and asked for $72 tip.that was very odd and uncomfortable,La Fusta Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Argentine,, Steakhouses,, Seafood"
2,JrY-85Zw9TCFAle9Q6NCYA,Andres C.,3.0 star rating,"Overall, it is a pleasant dining experience. I went there to eat about two weeks ago with the family. The place is small so the tables are within very close quarters of each other and you are practically rubbing elbows with your neighbor, but given its local popularity and a pleasant ambience, I'd say this is something that can be overlooked in my personal opinion. The servers are friendly and the service is good but nothing outta the ordinary. The sangria is fantastic. It is very flavorful, not bitter, and has a smooth drinkability, however it could be a little stronger, in terms of the amount of alcohol in it. As for the food, I absolutely loved the skirt steak. I'm a huge skirt steak fan and without exaggeration, it was one of the best skirt steaks I've had in Jersey. It was cooked perfectly. Their chimichurri sauce accompanies your steak and it amplifies the taste to whole other level. It tasted fresh and I would venture to guess, the sauce is home made and it really blew me away. I gave this place three stars because I feel that besides their skirt steak and sangria, everything else kinda fell kinda flat to me. The side that comes with your steak is a choice of fries or potatoes and I went with potatoes. Well, they are really nothing to write home about. They tasted like the instant potatoes you could buy at the grocery store. They were flavorless. The appetizers were also underwhelming. Much like the potatoes experience, the appetizers tasted like microwaved food in addition to being insanely small in portion size. Recommendation: order a meat platter or the skirt steak and you will not be disappointed. Skip on appetizers and order fries as a side.",La Fusta Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Argentine,, Steakhouses,, Seafood"

This place has managed to remain hidden as it is located in a somewhat seedy-looking part of North Bergen near hardware stores and metal works. Step inside though and you are suddenly in a red-brick countryside Spanish cottage. The food here is outstanding. I ordered the filet minon medallions in mushroom sauce, and the parilla. The parilla is a dish of grilled meats literally piled on to more grilled meats. The portion they served us was just staggering. That dish is easily enough to feed 2 people, maybe even 3. Its a feast on a plate! The filet medallions were just as impressive. The mushroom sauce was magnificent. Additionally the sauce soaks into all the veggies giving them even more flavor.All the meats were juicy, savory, and overall delicious. They have a different take on french fries where they add some ground up dried greens along with olive oil to the fries. I didn't think I'd like it but I was wrong, it was great.  Best of all, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food you get.

My wife is half Argentinian and there are next to zero Argentinian restaurants in the area. Couple that with the fact that i am a complete carnivore and well you get the picture.I had made reservations ahead of time and am glad i did as they were quite busy. We were seated quickly by a friendly supervisor/host. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. After about 10 minutes i walked to the host stand to get some menus. We were finally visited by our server about 5 minutes after that.We gave our drink and appetizer order. Our drinks were average. A ""sugary"" version of red sangria and a few tasty cinnamon martini-ish drinks. The appetizers arrived swiftly. The fried calamari was outstanding. Light, fresh, hot, and perfectly cooked. We had that with a spicy marinara sauce (fra diavlo), which was awesomely spicy. Our letil soup was weak, watery, and lacking of flavor. The house salad was huge enough for pretty much everybody to enjoy.For the entrees... 2 orders of ""La Fusta Americana""- abundant with several flavorful meats. Delicious and plump pork chops. Large tasty chicken breast. Bife de chorizo- traditional Argentinian sausage was good. Beef ribs were o.k. Surprisingly the churassco was underwhelming. My wifes were ordered well done, which is the wrong way to eat it lol. My sisters was medium so i had a piece of both and meh... In addition, the chimichurri was also disapointing. Not tart enough, and overly oily.My sons pork chops as a main dish were wonderful. Large, plump, juicy, properly seasoned and just plain excellent.My filet mignon let me down. Asked for medium rare and receiced medium well. I also was not a big fan of their marinade, which was quite vinegary and lacking of spices and/or herbs.The sides were average...mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, rice, fries, and sauteed onions.Deserts were hit and miss... Flan with dulce de leche (caramel) was very good. The chocolate mousse was over heated and as a result, ""runny"". My bannana crepes were tasty but too much rum was left behind on my plate which kind of made it feel like pancakes with a shot of Bacardi. The cafe con leches were however, amazing.I felt that La Fusta had a few high points which were muddied by a few low marks.

I ate most of it because i was starving and dying for a steak all day. It wasn't tough to chew or anything but it didn't have much taste. I'm sure there are other good things on the menu people enjoy, and it was late at night so i know the cooks want to leave, but I couldn't see the steak being much better even earlier in the day.

I also have never posted a negative review before so take that into consideration. I went on the recommendation of the clerk at the hotel where I am staying. I was starving haven eaten only breakfast in North Carolina on the way up to New Jersey. I was excited prior to walking in. As I walked in the completely empty restaurant at 5 pm, the servers had both jokes and insults. 3 stood in front of me. One said "" gotta use the bathroom? "" the other employee who would be my server said in rapid succession"" party of 4 ?."" I was alone. I asked the first server what he said and he said nothing. The unprovoked verbal assault took me off guard for a second but then it registered and as I sat I said ""No, I do not have to use the bathroom."" I was still hungry and needed to eat so I stayed but I should know better than dinning in an empty restaurant at dinner time. The product is usually stale and not fresh. People vote with their presence or absence. I asked about the chicken scarpariello and filet mignon. I asked for a brief description of this restaurants preparation. The waiter (funny guy number 2) was lost. He came back and mumbled what he was just told (from funny guy number 1) and described the filet as a boneless piece of meat. I knew better (or did I?) so I ordered it. He left the table. As he was at the computer I realized my omission and I got his attention again and told him that I wanted the filet well done (my meal, my preference).20 minutes later my food comes out... no filet. He runs back in the kitchen and comes out with a menu, points and says that is not what you ordered. I reminded him about the temperature of the filet. Then finally he acknowledged his error but that was only part of the problem. The chicken itself was inedible. It was dried out and chewy and not fit for human consumption. I tried 3 different sections of it and I had to literally pull them out of my mouth. It tasted like yesterdays chicken re-served and heated up today. Here is what they didn't know. I am a classically trained chef. Less than a year ago I was still working in restaurants for the previous 5 years. My family had been in the catering business for over 33 years and I know quality service and professionalism.

He tried to convince me that it was freshly cooked but even if it was a new plate I did not request it. He did not apologize for the kitchens mistake nor asked me what I would like. Then he simply took it back and did not say a word. If this isn't bad service, I don't know what is.",La Fusta Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Argentine,, Steakhouses,, Seafood"

Who knew this place would actually turn out surprisingly decent!Their lunch specials are awesome.  You can get full here easily for under $10 for lunch.  3 empanadas (meat and/or spinach) for $6.00, grilled chicken for $7, pasta for $7... yea.  In this area where I'm just expecting to pay $10+ for lunch, this place's prices for lunch pleasantly surprised me.Now onto the actual taste: bread is no good here, boo...felt the bread was a bit too dry for my taste.  However, the chicken dish I ordered was NOT DRY (!) and the juicy chicken pieces were flavored marvelously!!  They grilled it just right so that in certain pieces you can taste the grilled/smokey flavor, but it's not overwhelming.  They serve this dish with a side of mashed potatoes (random!), which could have used a little more butter/salt.Wine was so cheap here!  My friend ordered a bottle of Merlec red wine for only $15 (for three of us).I also got flan dessert, which had this awesome glob of caramel next to it (delicious!).  I felt the actual flan was soaked in sugary syrup for a bit too long, so I didn't finish the dessert.Anyway, I never knew about Argentine cuisine, and I guess this won't be the last of it, if this restaurant is any indication of what Argentine cuisine is like.  Bravo, La Fusta.",La Fusta Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,"Argentine,, Steakhouses,, Seafood"

The waiter Carlos is probably one of the best waiters you'll encounter. He makes you feel welcome through conversation and exquisite Argentinian food recommendations. He remembered and addressed my family (of 4) by name and checked in (in a non-annoying way) on us. His positive energy is contagious! He never brought the bill before we asked him. When you get the check without asking I kind of feel it's a way for waiters to say ""ok so you're done right?"" I had the skirt steak and fries. I recommend sharing it with someone  since its huge. For desert we shared the tres leches and the house cheese cake! Please have the house Cabernet wine with your steak. You'll thank yourself for hours.

We went for an early dinner, around 7pm on a Saturday night.  We ordered 2 steaks, I had the Shell steak ""Portuguesa"" with French fries and my boyfriend had the Minute steak with mashed potatoes.  The minute steak was a better flavor to me and was not covered in the sauce which I liked better.  I like to taste the meat, not to be over powered by sauce ya know?The server was a little on the ignoring side.  He was spotted several times sitting at the bar having conversations with some other men, I couldnt tell if they were staff members or customers. This is a laid back spot, no one is in a hurry to do anything, just hang out.Anyway, I had the house merlot, was expecting cheap.

Dining at La Fusta it was easy to forget you were in New Jersey and not in Argentina! We arrived at 7:30 pm on a Saturday. We were seated promptly and the restaurant was only about half full. By the time we left at about 10 pm, every table was taken and people were waiting outside. The food is well worth the wait.La Fusta has a wide selection of reasonably priced wines, including many varietals of Argentine wines from excellent and well established winemakers (restaurants often offer Argentine wines from unrecognizable or mediocre wineries). We were very pleased with our selection of a cabernet sauvignon from Catena Zatapa.We started our meal with a typical Argentine antipasto platter consisting of thin slices of delicate beef tongue in vinaigrette (lengua en escabeche) ,  a traditional rolled and stuffed meat (matambre), eggplant vinaigrette (berenjenas en escabeche), and an assortment of pickled vegetables and olives. Just like grandma used to make ... no kidding!We ordered a mixed grill (parrillada) which was bountiful and included skirt steak (entraña), short ribs, sweat breads (mollejas), Argentine sausage (chorizo), black pudding (morcilla), and chinchulines (if you don't know, don't ask). The meat was of high quality, perfectly cooked, and completely authentic. Phenomenal! We selected French fries a la Provencale (seasoned with fresh garlic and parsley) and a fresh salad of watercress, tomatoes, hearts of palm, avocado, and onions. Delicious. And no Argentine parrillada is complete without chimichurri and lots of fresh, crusty bread. For dessert we ordered the crepes stuffed with caramel (panqueques de dulce de leche). The crepes were tender, and the caramel was rich and creamy. They were served with a thin layer of burnt sugar on top, creating a nice candied coating. The espresso was served in the Argentine fashion with a lemon twist.The service was EXCEPTIONAL. We were served by a team of waiters and table staff all of which were attentive and courteous. The restaurant was expertly managed by Javier DeLeon, the general manager. Remarkably, considering how busy the restaurant was, Javier attended to all of the patrons, welcoming newcomers, socializing with repeat customers, making recommendations (which, in our case, were spot on), while expertly managing the wait and kitchen staffs. This is a first rate operation.I said it before and I'll say it again, La Fusta is an excellent and authentic Argentine restaurant.

Then the two of us shared the American Grill, which included grilled chicken, skirt steak, rib, porkchop and sausage. The meats were all very good. However, we asked for medium well and the skirt steak was more like rare. I hate when cooks cook the meat the way they want it.. what's the point of asking the customer how they want it?!?
