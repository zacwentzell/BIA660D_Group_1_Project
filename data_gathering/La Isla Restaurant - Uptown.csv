It has an authentic and beautiful ambiance - there are flowers, incredible decor and great music. The service is excellent - I've had the same waiter, and he always remembers our group!As for food, the empanadas and croqueta appetizers are fantastic. The pressed sandwiches are tasty and delicious. The shakes are also incredible - I recommend Mango! But the thing we love the most is their fries - my roommates and I have craved their french fries on multiple occasions.*I will add that this review if for Uptown only - the Downtown location looks very dirty and terrible from the outside. I definitely suggest Uptown.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban
1,hBTWUm0lHZDaslBs2vGJ3Q,Pobmeister L.,1.0 star rating,"Really put a damper to a great weekend. We sat down with high expectations based on our experience at La Isla downtown. We went for a family dinner and boy were we disappointed! The placemats were filthy. We didn't get menus until we asked for themWe had to ask for plates and cutlery for the kids. (Are kids supposed to eat straight off filthy placemats?)We asked for a half bottle of wine - the waiter came with a full bottle. She seemed annoyed when we corrected her and said we wanted the half bottle. The appetizers and entrees all came at the same time and the waiter (another server)  left me holding my entree above the table and walked away without looking to help me find some room to put the food down.  There was a hair on my entree (that was straight gross) I mentioned it and a very curt apology at the end of dinner. No mention of trying to make amends. I checked the bill at the end of the night and we were charged for both the half bottle and full bottle. The waiter at the end of the meal said ""this just isnt your night"" and yes she was right...it wasn't our night and it wasnt our idea of a good meal or experience. The food was mediocre at best. No one really ate much and dinner ended up being the overly salted plaintain chips that came with the appetizers and icecream for dessert. The bill came out to roughly 90 bucks for half bottle of wine and a few appetizers. I felt this was not at all worthwhile and will not return. Needed to post this since I use Yelp as a basis for much of my dining decisions. I typically leave a generous tip but this was the one time I felt, leaving half of what I typically leave was too much. At the very least, they should have comped the dessert for the hungry kids, miscalculating the bill, poor service and the hair in my food.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban
2,Zswzvb_IkTOefkw2vpvfZw,Nin A.,4.0 star rating,3.5Decent place. Interesting food selection but a little overpriced in my opinion. The ceviche appetizer failed to meet my expectations so I wouldn't recommend that. The salad was good and the beef in it was tasty and flavorful. The steak chimicuhiri appeared to be really popular. It looked really good but it was $28 per plate so I opted for the ropa vieja special because instead which turned out to be great but the rice that came with it wasn't enough.,La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban
3,QxTNaHoxTL8f7jAK5nwQ1g,Nicholas G.,2.0 star rating,gave this place a try again after my last review. I think this experience was not great. We ordered the empanada's to start and although they had good flavor they tasted a day old. Seems like they make them in advance and sell them whenever. The french toast was also stale similar to my last experience. The filling was good but did not taste fresh. I expected more and this place just didnt deliver.They also forgot one of my guests entrees and another side dish of ours. The manager did take these items off the bill so that was nice of them. I understand mistakes happen but they had forgotten 3-4 things during the course of our meal which is a problem.Unfortunately I probably wont be back.,La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

My husband and I came here with friends for a fun Friday night a couple weeks ago.  We had reservations (which we made earlier that night) for around 9pm.  We showed up a little early and were seated pretty immediately.  The interior is super cute, from the floor tiles to the chandelier - great vibes!We ordered a bottle of wine to share and started with some Aperitivos (apps).  We split 3 things (there were 4 of us): the Papa Rellenas, Croqueta de Jamon, and Vegetable Empanadas.  The Papa Rellenas were mashed potato stuffed w/ ground beef, breaded & fried ($4.50/each - we ordered 2).  They were heavy, and reminded me of arancini, not the most flavorful to be honest - but warm and cozy!  The Croquetas ($3/each - we ordered 2) were great, they were much longer than any croqueta I've seen - usually used to oblong/oval shapes, these resembled more of a mozzarella stick to be honest.  Regardless - they were just as creamy and ham-my as I was hoping - great!  The Vegetable Empanada was filled with spinach, crimini mushrooms, calabaza, and manchego cheese ($4.50/each - we ordered 2) - pretty good!  A bit on the dry side, despite having cheese.For dinner, I ordered shrimp, the Camarones al Ajillo: (shrimp sautéed in a white wine garlic sauce), and ordered plantains and brussel sprouts as the 2 sides.  The plantains and brussels were AMAZING - but I was too full to finish them (my husband gladly stepped up to the plate).  He ordered the Bistek de Palomilla (sirloin steak pounded thin, seared and topped with caramelized onions).  I had a bite, and although good - my dish was better!  Looking around the table, everyones' meals looked amazing!  My one friend ordered the Salmon, which gave me plate envy!  She got the Salmón a la Parrilla (grilled salmon in a hoisin guava sesame honey glaze, topped with pineapple mango salsa, over coconut quinoa salad) - said it was really great!Can't wait to try more, I would come here for drinks and apps too - I like the atmosphere.  Our server was really friendly and nice - lots of the reviews speak about terrible service/staff, but luckily we didn't encounter this!",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

6,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"Not a bad option for Cuban food in Hoboken. Our party of 6 came in on a Thursday just after 7 and we got one of the last tables. The place was pretty packed at that time.To start, we ordered the Calamar Fruit (crispy calamari served with fire roasted chili dipping sauce) and the Montaditos (shrimp and chorizo over tostones with red chimichurri). The calamari was pretty basic - nothing special. I was expecting more out of the 'fire-roasted chili dipping sauce', but instead it tasted pretty similar to marinara sauce. The shrimp app was good but I didn't really like the chorizo, even though I normally LOVE it. The chorizo in this dish tasted like an extra smokey hot dog. Not many other flavor notes other than that.For my entree, I opted for El Cuban (pulled pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle with garlic mojo). I figured you can't go wrong with the classic. Plus, I love cuban sammies. It was nice - perfectly pressed with gooey cheese. But when I tried a bite of the Cuban reuben (corned beef, braised short rib, swiss cheese, pickle, mustard caraway mojo), which is was my BF's Dad ordered, I immediately wished I had order this instead. The meat wasn't as dry as the one in the regular Cuban and was just much more flavorful. I also ordered a side of yuca fries, which I really enjoyed.As for dessert, we ordered the Torta de Limon Frisado con Almivar de Cilantro (frozen key lime pie with cilantro/lime syrup and toasted almonds) and one of the specials, a passionfruit cheesecake. We were all intrigued by the cilantro/lime syrup on a key lime pie. It was interesting in a good way. But overall, everything was too sweet for me. I didn't like the passionfruit cheesecake because it was also very sweet, and I'm not too fond of passionfruit. However, everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy both dessert we ordered. I guess I'm just not a desserts kind of gal.I'd definitely come back to try some of their $5 apps during happy hour (which ends at 7, so we just missed it that night).",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

16,IX0ILZlV3DmpqXlLTV88xw,Brandon H.,1.0 star rating,"Shame Shame SHAME!!! A thousand and one lashes with a barbed wire for the workers here.I will start out and say food was decent, if this was based on food alone, i would say 2.5 out of 5, nothing special but wasn't awful.However the service here is TERRIBLE! The worst, the single worst experience i have ever had. Where to start:1. Was lied to about happy hour: The waitress barley spoke English witch is a very nasty thing to subject customers to. She lied and said happy hour included everything even pitchers of sangria , we were surprised by this but she had said it was included so we ordered 2! Get the bill no happy hour half off like she said and then she pointed to tiny tiny tiny text that said pitchers aren't included when we said she said it was she said she did not!  A true fabricator  and nasty women! 2. Forgot our appetizers and lied again: We ordered $50 in appetizers that our AWFUL waitress forgot, she came over with our entrees and we were like what about our appetizers and she says "" oh i forgot i will bring them out later. UHM EXCUSE ME we wanted to start with those, she acted like she was doing us a favor by bringing our food back to bring the appetizers out first.  She said she would comp some appetizers. Another LIE!3. The adventure that was paying: After accusing us of lying about her saying pitchers were included in happy hour we noticed she did not take off the appetizers that she forgot as she said she would, she then tries to give us a $10 bill saying she did not want to remove it. We said no take if off the bill like you said, she went and removed one $4 thing. For all her awful nasty horrible service to comp $4 on a $300 bill was disgraceful and insulting. She was very rude and snotty! She then lost my credit card and played dumb like she never had it, even after she swiped it through. I got the check back without my credit card! She was very smug insisting she gave it back. When i argued with her for 5 minuets about it, somehow it magically appeared in her hand from the floor! 4: The waitress and the sneak attack: To say i was disappointed with how i was treated here would be an understatement. If i did my job the same way she does hers, i would be fired immediately. She was a real nasty women! So i ask for the manager, when she sees this, she comes sprinting over apologizing. She wouldn't even let me talk to the manager she kept interrupting and was annoying yelling SORRY SORRY over, after being rude all night she was sorry in front of the manager. No one seemed to care and it was really awful.If you are even considering going here DO NOT! Worst service ever ever! Mediocre food needs good service to make up for it. Here the service is horrendous.   Not to mention it was very empty and got seated in the middle of the only two other tables that had people there.Shame on them for how they treat costumers. and SHAME on me for allowing it to happen over and over!

18,z-qKDbBD1tjPuvxvTJReGw,Carlo K.,3.0 star rating,"La Isla - Uptown has a very different feel than their original location on First & Washington in Hoboken. Unlike the homey mom and pop feel of the original location, Las Isla uptown has a modern, clean, upscale vibe - nothing wrong with that just something to note if you'd been to the original location and are expecting the same experience.My favorite Cuban dish is Ropa Vieja, so I was pleased to find it as one of the Friday specials. Unfortunately, when I tried to oder it the waiter informed me they were all out. He recommended Tasajo con Boniato which is braised salt-cured shredded beef. Having no backup plan in mind and knowing that this dish was featured on Dinners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I went for it.When the food arrived the dish wasn't very visually appealing, but that's never stopped me. However, the taste wasn't appealing either. The braised meet was way too salty and I couldn't stomach more than a couple before I had enough. Luckily, I was with a group and they were ready to share their food. Other dishes I tried were much better, but I cannot really speak to those because I only had a couple bites.Overall, it's close to my apartment and I've had friends with more positive experiences so willing to give it another shot - but first go around was a bit rough.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

UHM EXCUSE ME we wanted to start with those, she acted like she was doing us a favor by bringing our food back to bring the appetizers out first.  She said she would comp some appetizers. Another LIE!3. The adventure that was paying: After accusing us of lying about her saying pitchers were included in happy hour we noticed she did not take off the appetizers that she forgot as she said she would, she then tries to give us a $10 bill saying she did not want to remove it. We said no take if off the bill like you said, she went and removed one $4 thing. For all her awful nasty horrible service to comp $4 on a $300 bill was disgraceful and insulting. She was very rude and snotty! She then lost my credit card and played dumb like she never had it, even after she swiped it through. I got the check back without my credit card! She was very smug insisting she gave it back. When i argued with her for 5 minuets about it, somehow it magically appeared in her hand from the floor! 4: The waitress and the sneak attack: To say i was disappointed with how i was treated here would be an understatement. If i did my job the same way she does hers, i would be fired immediately. She was a real nasty women! So i ask for the manager, when she sees this, she comes sprinting over apologizing. She wouldn't even let me talk to the manager she kept interrupting and was annoying yelling SORRY SORRY over, after being rude all night she was sorry in front of the manager. No one seemed to care and it was really awful.If you are even considering going here DO NOT! Worst service ever ever! Mediocre food needs good service to make up for it. Here the service is horrendous.   Not to mention it was very empty and got seated in the middle of the only two other tables that had people there.Shame on them for how they treat costumers. and SHAME on me for allowing it to happen over and over!

38,z-qKDbBD1tjPuvxvTJReGw,Carlo K.,3.0 star rating,"La Isla - Uptown has a very different feel than their original location on First & Washington in Hoboken. Unlike the homey mom and pop feel of the original location, Las Isla uptown has a modern, clean, upscale vibe - nothing wrong with that just something to note if you'd been to the original location and are expecting the same experience.My favorite Cuban dish is Ropa Vieja, so I was pleased to find it as one of the Friday specials. Unfortunately, when I tried to oder it the waiter informed me they were all out. He recommended Tasajo con Boniato which is braised salt-cured shredded beef. Having no backup plan in mind and knowing that this dish was featured on Dinners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I went for it.When the food arrived the dish wasn't very visually appealing, but that's never stopped me. However, the taste wasn't appealing either. The braised meet was way too salty and I couldn't stomach more than a couple before I had enough. Luckily, I was with a group and they were ready to share their food. Other dishes I tried were much better, but I cannot really speak to those because I only had a couple bites.Overall, it's close to my apartment and I've had friends with more positive experiences so willing to give it another shot - but first go around was a bit rough.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

They did a great job with decorations 2, they stepped up their game on the drinks. The coffee is amazing and still at reasonable prices. 3, this is perfect for date night or an intimate outing. Presentation is beautiful and portions were reasonable without leaving you super full. Which can be a good/bad thing. I take it as a good thing so I can try different dishes.

We were seated promptly and the server was quick to pay attention to us. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, which was a black bean hummus and some veggies sandwiched between two soft 7-grain bread. It's not pressed like most Cuban sandwiches but I aware of that. It was fresh and refreshing as I wasn't looking to eat any meat that evening. It comes with a side of fried plantains. I've had better but still ok taste! My boyfriend had a chicken dish that had spinach underneath it. It was covered with this amazing sauce, I should have asked what It was but it is so good. I think the chicken was slightly over cooked though. It comes with your choice of two sides, and he chose fried yuca and sweet plantains. Both were very yummy and sizable sides.

Drinks each were $10 absurd for quality of drink, Mojito tasted like pure lemon and my Tequila drink was more coconut than anything else. We ordered two appetizers and two entres, food was okay nothing out of this world.  Ceviche de camarones & vegetable empanadas were good but portion too small again for price of plate.  We also ordered two entrees, the half chicken & camarones enchilados.  My husband's chicken was actually good but the rice was cold. And my entree the camarones enchilados was not good at all, 6 pieces of shrimp in tomato sauce for $19 is ridiculous. My rice was also cold & dry and the beans were over seasoned. The food also took forever to come, don't understand because it wasn't busy at all.Overall our experience wasn't at all a good one, both service and quality not up to standards for the price you end up paying.  I don't mind paying a hefty bill when we dine out but as long as food and service is exceptional which clearly isn't the case at La Isla.  I'd have to say what stood out and seemed ridiculous the most from our first & definitely last visit to La Isla was what seemed to be the owner telling her employees how to do there job.  After we finished our apps, she had to tell the waitress to remove the dirty plates from our table. These are things that a profesional waitress should know.  Stay away from La Isla, there are much better places to eat at like Zacks Oak Bar on Willow Avenue.  Trust me you will see the difference right away as soon as you walk into the place.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

I would say that if you visit this place, visit the bar and NOT the restaurant.  The food itself was tasty -- salty and fried how can you go wrong? -- but I found out this morning that my meal came at a huge cost. Besides paying for food and beverages (my tab came out to abt 60 for shared appetizers, a drink and an entree) I paid dearly with my time this morning given that I was incapacitated with stomach pain and frequently in the bathroom for nearly 2 hours. The staff was very friendly but almost too friendly. They checked in on us quite often -- to the point where we noticed it and felt uncomfortable. They were also pushy with the menu suggestions. We were ordering appetizers and the waitress suggested a platter instead which we agreed to and it came out with a shrimp special. They were good and but we werent even halfway through before the entrees came out. And not only was there no proper spacing between the meals, but 2 entrees came out together and then later another 2 entrees. Very disorganized and not a good experience. We would have preferred to space the meal out and not feel like we had to rush to finish our first course. In addition, since the tables are small, they were trying to remove plates when we weren't finished just to make space. We originally were 5 and later we were 4 and the table could barely hold the 4 of us so I am not sure how they had originally planned to seat 5 at our table. There was no space.

The worst thing I could say about them is the bartender at lunch tries to get you to buy more expensive meal instead of daily special which they have Rotating set of three. Whether get special or entree have choice of two sides of which I choose usually the rice, beans, or yucca.   My stomach enjoys the Meat which is always tasty and my wallet enjoys the affordable prices as sandwiches are around 10, daily specials 14 and the entrees can be had for 20.  It is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

I love Cuban food and I've been to Cuban restaurants all over including The Cuban (in Hoboken) and authentic Cuban restaurants in Miami and this place can hold its own. The staff are genuinely friendly, the food is great and the sangria pitchers are not all juice like most other places. I highly recommend this place for semi-casual date night. The ambiance is nothing like the downtown location and in my opinion the food is even better. The vibe is great and the music is always fun.

This one had a real bar with taps. Totally different decor.I have only had a few plates here. Everything was prepared quickly and very well seasoned and cooked.

Service has been good every time we've been.The food has also been consistently pretty good. I particularly like the Yuca with truffle appetizer and the skirt steak with chimichurri.  They have a nice wine list and a nice selection of sipping rums, as well as good cocktails.Surprisingly, the only think I really haven't enjoyed is the stuffed French Toast that was featured on the Food Network.But all in all, La Isla is a solid spot.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

When I heard about their new uptown location, I decided I want to try it out to celebrate my birthday. My husband and I made reservations for Sunday brunch however it looks like it wasn't necessary to make a reservation because there were plenty of open tables when we were seated. My husband ordered the Omar's stuffed French toast (since it was featured in food network) and I opted for the omelette which you get to choose 3 fillings (I ordered chorizo, manchego cheese, and maduros). I almost went with the churrasco instead and kind of wish I had. The omelette was served with a small serving of their homefries (which were good) and Cuban toast (Yum). The French toast was ok but the strawberry overpowered the flavor. I was expecting more guava cheese and not so much strawberry. We also ordered 2 brunch cocktails which WERE STRONG! The passion fruit belini for me and el bucanero for my husband. I preferred his drink! Service was good. Fast and friendly. I found out to be really pricy but I've been spoiled by low cost delicious Cuban food in my north Hudson area.

La Isla Downtown, of course, is a beloved fixture of Hoboken, with quirky decor, fast service, friendly staff and amazing food. The food here was merely ""okay,"" although my Cubano sandwich was slightly undercooked, and the Morir Sonando for some reason was disguised as a yuppie frappé. Very disappointing. I understand that a business would like to expand, but doing so by discarding everything that made the original great is a losing proposition.

I do have to say that customer service has never been that great there except for when we sit at the bar. The bartender who always took great care of us is now a manager. Too bad he wasn't working.

This review is solely on the service.  My mother and I walked in about 11:27 in search for a great Cuban breakfast.  We were seated right away but waited for our waitress about 12 minutes.  As she took her time to approach our table (because she was talking to other staff members), she didn't introduce herself or asked us if it was our first time there (it was). She asked us if we wanted drinks; my mother and I both said yes. I then proceeded to order a beer because we were celebrating a special occasion and she replied ""interesting choice"" and completely disregard my mom and began to walk away.  My mother then had to reach for her and ask for a Cubanccinno. Another item we really wanted to try.  Needless to say at this point they just stopped serving breakfast. The place is empty and perhaps, if I asked, they may be able to do something to accommodate. I asked the waitress if it was possible to order breakfast since that's the only reason we were there and it was our first time. She immediately said no, and I had to request If she could just make a small exception for us since it was just closed and it wasn't busy.  She said she would ""try"" and came back saying that they had ""wiggle"" room to accommodate but she wanted me to come up with something WITHOUT looking at the breakfast menu.  She has a very nasty attitude and it did seem like she did not want to work.  Now, maybe I'm being Too critical since I'm also in the service business, but her behaviors is unnecessary and it cost the owner returning customers.  I specifically went there because I'm a Guy Fieri fan and I love that guy and his show. And I am sure if you were to go to his restaurant, this waitress' service would not be tolerated.  Unfortunately, I must express my experience because it was that annoying.

Really?! This is a sit down NOT fast food restaurant!! Why would you do this??? You can tell they have been precooked immediately when you bit into them. Our meals were dry and warm, not hot. Which leads me to believe they were premade and just warmed up as well. The only thing keeping me from giving 1 star is their happy hour. All drinks on the menu are half price. KEEP IN MIND they are drinks on menu only.

We got seated by our extremely professional server, Alexa, who took our orders of margaritas while we glanced over the menu. There was a great selection of food but my friend and I both stuck to the specials of the day that ranged between $12-$15 and consisted of a main dish and 2 sides. I decided to get the lechón, rice and plantains while my friend got the ropa vieja, rice and plantains. Our margaritas arrived shortly after and were pretty strong but delicious.Once I got my lechón the first thing I noticed was how incredibly SALTY it was. The plantains were a life savior to counter the saltiness in the lechón but I got to the point where I couldn't handle it anymore. I asked my friend to try some as she wasn't as sensitive to salt as I was and she cringed at it as well. I explained my issue to Alexa who with no hesitation or attitude took the plate away to exchange it.

The first time we dined in here, I was not as enthused about the food here partly due to the reputation of the downtown location and the quality of what we ordered. That said, I was hoping to give them another shot. This time, I simplified my order and opted for a Cuban sandwich and a salad. The salad was generously proportioned, with a light but flavorful house champagne dressing. The combination of blue cheese, citrus, mango, chopped macadamias, avocado (very fresh), and red onion added a lot of depth and texture to the California spinach. Very generous portion. Delicious! El Cubano sandwich was awesome. Generous in size, great flavor and texture within the meat, topped with melted cheese and pickles. I will definitely order this again.

Soaring ceilings with Caribbean style fans, beautiful Spanish tile floors, the rest of the interior white, airy and chic. Latin jazz vibrated gently in the background. This is definitely not a diner, drive in, or dive.The menu is the same (including the prices), with the notable addition of a liquor license and accompanying bar. They really push the cocktails, actually withholding food menus until drink orders are placed. The servers look more polished, dressed in black with tight chignons, but the service is equally indifferent as its predecessor.We ordered some old standbys, pollo al ajillo and ropa vieja. The portions, while not as gargantuan as the downtown location, were still generous. And thankfully, the food tasted pretty much the same - delicious.All sounds good, right? So why 3 stars when I unabashedly adore the other location? There were strollers here, several. No one would ever dare bring a stroller to the downtown location for fear of invoking a riot in the cramped space. A toddler actually waddled over to me and had her hand on my thigh. Not cute. The crowd here was dressed to the nines and definitely looking to see and be seen. It was very uptown. That's not why I go to la isla. I go there to devour enormous quantities of Cuban comfort food in a relaxed environment while being casually ignored by the waitstaff.

We did stick it out (it was almost 10 so what choice did we have to go elsewhere?) and I got the mahi mahi special which was very good, but small for $24 and my husband got the steak for $22 (good, but compared to Cuban, which has awesome sides, sauce to DIE for, sub par).  Okay.Now again, the kitchen and bar staff dealt with this as best they could (no idea what happened  though) - Comp'd the shrimp and a drink, so no complaints there.  But honestly, the food is overpriced and simply not that good.  Basically the same plague that befalls the majority of Hoboken spots.  I was also very disappointed that one of the owners (we were clued into this when we sat by other guests), who was sitting two seats down from us and saw this whole debacle, didn't say word ONE to us.  C'mon!All said, save for getting that mojito again and hitting the bar for drinks, when I'm craving Cuban, I'll continue to make the trek downtown.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

140,QsrbTtqF6zD2B6pKbKpkUQ,Rochele T.,3.0 star rating,"First off, my friend and I are huge fans of La Isla and have been going there for many many years, in fact, it's my favorite restaurant on the planet to date.  We were so excited that they had decided to expand and open a new location closer to home.  That being said, I was very disappointed in our dinner last night at the new location.  The new place looks amazing and the service was excellent, however it was extremely loud and we had to shout at our friends in order to be heard in a conversation, it was like being at an elementary school cafeteria during lunchtime.  The food wasn't the same quality or presentation as the original location.  Portions were much smaller, the skirt steak (we ordered 3 of them) came out alone on a white plate with no garnish (no lime/no onions, nothing) they even forgot to put the sauce that belong on it on top,  the black beans were less seasoned and tasteless in comparison,  the boiled yucca and tostones were missing the crushed seasoned garlic, and the Key lime pie was soft like whip cream rather than hard like ice cream on a tiny canoe plate with very little cilantro sauce (which makes this dish) and no cookie or whip cream.  The chef/owners really need to reevaluate things and try to mirror the dishes of the original location, because the food has lost its special flavors in the new location and for long time loyal fans, it was a big disappointment for me and my girlfriend.  For the 3 people we brought as our guests that had not been there previously, they thought it was good, but had they eaten at the old location they would have been floored as were my guest that have come along in the past.Also, it felt like the new location was trying to step up their game by having the wait staff wear all black collared shirts with long aprons and in my opinion, that look is a bit stuffy and doesn't go well with the food.  I understand what they are trying to do by appealing to a higher class of clientele, but I believe the place would feel more accessible if the staff wore the t-shirts or polo shirts.This new place, as it stands today, pales in comparison to the original unfortunately - but I will go again to see if improvements have been made in a few months.  It would be nice to be able to make a reservation and be seated faster; but only if we can get the same quality of food and experience.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

146,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,4.0 star rating,"I've eaten at the original La Isla down on Washington Street a few times and always enjoyed the food there, but I was especially glad when I noticed they were opening a second location closer to where I live. On Friday (07/03), my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out and see if it was just as good as the La Isla we've come to know and love.First off, the layout is somewhat similar to the original: a long bar/counter frames the front, with small tables lined up along the side. Since the space is larger, though, there are more tables around the perimeter of the place, although we sat at the bar because it looked like every table was already occupied.The menu appears to be identical to the original location's, which is good, since I recognized some of my favorites. I decided to order the Ropa Vieja with a side of black beans and white rice, and my boyfriend ordered the roasted half chicken with yellow rice. I had a bit of a hard time understanding our waitress; her accent was very thick and she spoke softly. But she brought our food out quickly and was very pleasant. My Ropa Vieja was very good, but I found myself comparing it to what I've had at The Cuban, and I'm sorry to say that what I had The Cuban was slightly better. La Isla's Ropa Vieja was cooked well, but the shreds of meat stuck together and were on the dry side, and there wasn't a whole lot of sauce to mix in with the white rice. The black beans were delicious, though. I also tried some of my boyfriend's chicken and...wow. Just wow. I should have ordered that. The chicken was not only roasted, but marinated in a light garlic sauce, so the meat was extremely tender and fell off the bone (literally). The next time I come here, I will order the chicken.Before we left, I decided to get the guanabana sour sop, which tasted like a mix of strawberries, pineapples, and apples with a hint of coconut and milk. It was very tasty and not too thick, which made it easy for me to enjoy during our walk home.Overall, I think the second La Isla is worth another visit. The next time we come, though, I'd rather sit at a table. The counter stools are a bit high, and for vertically-challenged people like myself, that's not necessarily a good thing. ;-p",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

It was clearly a family dinner. Two mothers, an aunt, me, & my sis in law. It wasn't a bride with all of her friends looking for a night out. We were asked why my sis in law was wearing a tiara & we told them. When a man looking like he's the manager came up to us with shots of tequila for everyone, we were a little confused, but we looked past it. Should have taken this as a red flag, especially since I'm only 19 & I wasn't even carded. He was so upset 20 minutes later when he showed up & none of us drank those tequila shots. It was a nice gesture, but it was clearly a family dinner & I don't understand why he kept pushing us to take tequila shots, even offering to bring us more & then told us he'd drive us home. So weird. We left the restaurant & we split the payment into three equal parts-- two card & one cash. We told the waitress how we wanted to split it & she told us IT WAS OK. NOT ONCE DID SHE OPEN HER MOUTH TO TELL US IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. She returned our cards & the change in cash. We left happily. Nobody stopped us. No one said anything about our payment method. We were told to have a good night. Two of us, me & the aunt, stepped back in briefly because our parking pass wasn't working. The same man came up to us asking why we didn't pay the rest/ didn't leave tip. We left a good tip, too. Not just some spare change we had. When the aunt tried to explain how we paid, he kept walking away rudely, printing out the receipt, not even letting us speak. I knew for a fact that the change we got back was correct. He claimed only our card went through & we left no cash. So where was the cash we paid with? He told us to come back with the cash. Both of us left so astounded at the way he was speaking to us, especially since WE PAID. Literally two minutes after we stepped out, he chased us down saying that the ""bus boy found the money under the table."" He said WE dropped the money under the table. Please someone explain to me how does that even make sense if we were only handed back the change. This guy is a liar & the waitress who took our money was clearly trying to take that cash & keep it for herself. Little did she know we would come back for the parking ticket. Look, I work in customer service/food industry & I know how to act in these situations. I am a 19 year old girl & I could have handled this WAY better than this grown man. Don't blame us for your crappy & sneaky waiters. Clearly, this guy was super unprofessional. This restaurant is super sketch.

We all felt that it was extremely loud. The decibel levels are off the charts.  The seating is a bit too close for comfort which didn't help. Makes for having a conversation rather challenging.

We arrived about 20 minutes late because we pulled into the wrong lot & had to switch over the to correct one. We were told our table was given away after being 10 minutes late. We weren't called to be made aware of this. Ok, policy is policy. But they were so rude on top of it all. They said you can seat yourself at the bar if you want ""it's over there"".

Another time I got a cuban sandwich to go for lunch and it was awesome. I love cuban sandwiches and Im pretty picky but there was nothing to complain about with this one.

181,8DvkDaeyubRwcpGCp9hg5w,Scott S.,5.0 star rating,"I'm pretty skeptical of restaurants expanding, as I feel growth breeds mediocrity in cases where the restaurant wasn't really built for scaling (e.g. Grimaldi's, Shake Shack, Carlos Bakery). So when I heard of Hoboken La Isla opening another location uptown, particularly in Maxwell, not surprisingly, I wasn't too enthused. After all, Cuban food in Hoboken is fantastic between The Cuban, Zafra, and La Isla. I think there's a rubbishy one somewhere by the PATH, but I can't remember the name at the moment.   I am a huge fan of the original La Isla, and the oldschoolness to it as well as the food. I hesitate to use a food review cliches like authentic, because obviously I haven't been to Cuba, artisinal because I don't know what the means, hidden gem, yummy goodnees, and nom nom nom because they are annoying.Anyway, La Isla Uptown accepts opentable reservations, which for brunch is great, considering I had family coming in which included two small (~15 kilos), but hungry nieces. Have to say the decor was nice, and the space was  good compared to the original location which is rather cramped. I really thought the service was phenomenal, everyone from the hostess to the waitresses were friendly, attentive, and accommodating, which generally uplifts the mood of everyone, so I thank them for that. They were also patient with aforementioned nieces, which is always helpful.The brunch food was incredible, it was up there among the top of the internal list. people in my party had juevos rancheros, egg sandwich, stuffed french toast (obviously), sides, omelettes, parfaits and some other stuff. Everyone seemed to love their meal, and I thought everything I tried was fantastic and really can't wait to get it again! However, and don't let this influence you, my 6 year old niece didn't really like the french toast (yet had a specific Chinese food order I had to make when we got home) while the 2 year old ate every egg dish that our table had. Finally, I would add two things - the mojito was good, and the prices were excellent.To summarize, I'm a huge fan, and recommend La Isla Uptown to you.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

My son's skirt steak was well executed and had good flavors. My daughter's burger was as ordered. But that's where it ends. Now, we were a party of five with reservations at least a week in advance and we were sat at a four top in the corner of their ""diner looking "" dining room. I was sat at the end and we had very little room on the table. Being Saturday night, it wasn't fun to be so close to the foot traffic,  but I was in the aisle, so... Next, it was 60 degrees outside, yet the A/C was still on. Probably wouldn't have been a problem if they didn't have a bunch of large ceiling fans going at a good clip. We requested the waiter to turn off the fan, as it was cooling off our food (and us) quickly. He said he didn't have the time to get on a ladder and apologized.  Wow, fans without remotes? Really? Ok, now on to the forgettable food. Black beans were incredibly salty. My chicken breast was pounded thin and totally dry, though not salty. The calamari was soggy and oily, I couldn't eat it. The plantains were also greasy and cold, though probably would have been fine if they were hot.  I can't speak to the dessert,  because by that time, we had all lost our appetite.

On this night everyone seems very busy and a bit overwhelmed.  Our waiter took our drink order but the beer list wasn't updated so we had a bit of confusion when figuring out what to order.  We opted for the arroz con pollo and half roasted chicken.  Since our food was a special of the night it actually came out of a steam table which normally would terrify me but in this case the food was still delicious and the chicken moist and tender.  Bae's chicken was also on point and it came with two sides. The tostones were hot and delicious but lacked in that delicious garlic sauce I'm accustomed to.  We tried to be healthy by getting veggies but they were lathered in butter and garlic.  Overall I was really impressed.  The food was on point, the space is new and inviting, and the service attentive but a bit overwhelmed.  I'll be back.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

Had chicken empanada. Best I've ever had. Full of flavor. No crazy ingredients. Had chicken soup and excellent. Intense chicken flavor in broth. Lots of perfectly cooked shredded chicken. Home made, not from a Panara soup bladder. Had steak milenesa. They wouldn't add eggs which was odd. However, may have been the most flavorful milenesa I've ever had. Very pleased. For dessert I had the coco flan. After a meal of great food, this flan took the crown. Perfect texture and flavor. Nice sauce. Ground coconut shavings on top with a cherry drizzle. Yummmmmmy. The yellow rice was subpar. The plantains were fine, but nothing special. Would go here again.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

Food is usually delicious but can be uneven.  My Cuban sandwich was way too dry. Downtown location is better for some reason.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

Our waitress answered all our questions, even got us the dessert despite the fact that the kitchen had closed. We ordered garlic chicken and caramelized chicken and the sangria. Then for dessert we got the tres leches cake - which is probably the best tres leches cake I had. Highly recommend this place! And ask for Sandra; she was a great waitress.",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban

We were lucky to have Sandra as our server, who recommended an amazing appetizer of fish ribs. We now know of the Pacu fish that makes four ribs to a fish. It was a delicious surprise dish! You must have the fish ribs (when they are in season). I can't wait to come back!!!",La Isla Restaurant - Uptown,3.5 star rating,$$,Cuban
