Focaccia bread came with a mellow tomato sauce on top and the sun-dried tomato dip added a nice richness. Tuna tartare was fresh and meshed really well with the avocado mousse. The smooth avocado with the nice bite of the tuna was a great mix with the soy wasabi mayo adding a salty kick and the fried wonton adding crunch. Garlic rubbed skirt steak had good seasoning and went great with the crispy shoe string potatoes. Nutella creme brulee was creamy and sweet. The flavor had just the right amount of nutella in it and the crunchy sugar was a good mix. The texture of all the foods were great!Service - 4/5. It was a busy night but I was seated relatively quickly and the service was friendly and attentive. They gave me the wrong entree at first but rectified the problem quickly and without hesitation.Value - 5/5. Delicious three course meal plus complimentary bread for $29 is an absolute deal! Any restaurant that can get food textures on point is worth a visit and on restaurant week, even more so.Parking - Street (Metered)",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

Given that it was St. Patrick's Day, I wasn't sure how crazy it would be with patrons decked out in green. Luckily the Brass Rail has a spacious and calm second floor for dinner goers. The first floor is more of the party centric bar area. While the second floor was practically empty when we showed up for our 7pm reservation, it filled up quickly with large parties and was full by the time we left. Would highly recommend making a reservation beforehand. We started with the calamari, which was super crispy and came with a sweet and sour thai dipping sauce. I enjoyed the special - medium rare hanger steak with a mushroom and potato hash with bleu cheese and a few stalks of asparagus. The steak was so tender and delicious!!! My boyfriend had the potato gnocchi with truffle meatballs. Also a great filling choice - perfect for a cold night. Drinks were also on point - I enjoyed my 'pretty in pink' lychee flavored cocktail. They have a pretty large beer and wine selection as well. Will need to come back here for brunch soon!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

It took them about 30 minutes to bring out the first appetizers which were both cold and neither tasted very good. At that point we were hoping that the egg Benedict's would be great since we had brunch there a different time and we personally didn't remember it being this bad. 40 minutes later still no food, I catch the waitress and ask whats going on. She goes in the kitchen and quickly comes back out with food, yes finally, crisis averted! Nope not at all, both of them were super cold. I don't know if they just don't have enough people there to bring this food out or what happened there. We called the manager to take it away. She didn't even say sorry.

This place is a great place to grab drink with friends or a perfect place to bring a date. All the times I came here there has been ample seating. Sometimes you would have to wait to be seating, but the wait usually is not that long. The atmosphere here is good and the service has always been great. It should be noted that the food wait time can run a little bit if its packed. (There is outdoor seating) The food quality is above average for a bar.

I've been here for drinks before but went with a friend for dinner on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience. There was no wait for 2 at 8pm on a Friday night though the place (esp outdoors) was fairly packed. We sat outside on the non-Washington Street side and it was alot more secluded. Good service as our waitress was very attentive and drink/dinner orders taken fairly quickly. Our waitress checked on us often.  Huge cocktail menu as well as tons of craft beers/drafts and wines. You will find what you want to drink here. Menu focuses on classic American proteins (salmon, chicken, steak, hamburger) but fairly wide selection of options. They also have a good selection of appetizers (btw $10-15) and sandwiches. We split some calamari ($12) to start. Very delicious flaky breading. They also gave pieces of soft focaccia to start that melts in your mouth. The main courses are not cheap (btw $20-30) and are a bit pricey compared to other options in the area. However, the food was well executed and well flavored.  I got the salmon and was really impressed w/the flavors and the well cooked salmon. The greens were also delicious and my only complaint is that I wanted more!  My friend got chicken and was also very pleased.All in all, a great meal. It's more expensive than other area restaurants but it's good food and a nice environment to enjoy dinner and drinks.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

Zing!The Brass Rail offers both a vibrant outdoor and indoor seating area right on the main strip of Washington Street. We opted for outdoor seating to enjoy some of the amazing New Jersey weather and a few cocktails with brunch. The service was fast and we had both our drinks and appetizers in front of us within about ten minutes of sitting down. I suggest getting the $22 fixed brunch menu that includes one drink, an appetizer and a main course, this is a great option if you're looking to try multiple things on the menu. We ordered one fixed menu and then ordered a la carte for the rest of the way, starting with; Fried Falafel Bites with yogurt cucumber dip, Breakfast Lasagna, which is a take on a Monte Cristo: French toast layered with bacon, ham, scrambled eggs and jack cheese sauce topped with maple syrup, and Eggs Benedict with lobster added on. The Falafel Bites was bland and definitely needed garlic and parsley, thank goodness for the cucumber dipping sauce. The Eggs Benedict was very tasty, the egg was cooked perfectly and once cut the yolk ran down and coated the lobster and mini-bagel, nummers! The Breakfast Lasagna was the best option of the morning, stacked French toast, eggs and cheese sauce. All this topped with maple syrup along with crunchy sweet toast and the fluffy eggs made for some great texture.Prime spot for people watching and capturing the ""hair of the dog"" on a Sunday Funday!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

We were the second table to be seated upstairs and I excitedly shifted through the menu as my SO had referred to this place as a more upscale restaurant, considering Hoboken. I can agree with that. Our drinks were made strong (my dirty martini was a tad too salty, however), and my chicken was cooked thoroughly well. I just don't see the beauty in this place to give it anything more than 3 stars. It's just too average, run of the mill restaurant, with ok service and better than most other Hoboken joints, which I consider, for the vast majority, deserving of 2 stars. We had to pack some of our food home - we never got to it. Good food but not memorable enough to want to reheat it. I'd be down for another very casual date night dinner - for outdoor seating, as it's set up in a dimly lit romantic ambience that I adore.

I than ordered the warm fruit cobbler with a vanilla mascarpone cream to start, followed by the country ham hash as my entree.The only critique I would have about brunch that day is that the ""gravy"" that was served with my hash was a little heavy for a beautiful 80 degree summer day. Now, that's somewhat my fault because I obviously could have chose something more fresh and vibrant, but it was still delicious.

We weren't eating but there were plenty of compelling menu items. They have a section from Murray's Cheese which I thought was pretty cool and not something I've seen before.

If you're looking for quantity over quality, you'll be IN LOVE with this place. If you're a foodie and price isn't your main concern... this is totally not the place for you.As a college student, sometimes price ends up having a huge weight on my decision when choosing where to dine. I'm all in favor of searching for a good bang for my buck! The Brass Rail does its job- it filled my belly and gave me a nice buzz;) Plus, the environment was nice. That said, there's no denying that nothing was spectacular. Drinks- options include mimosas, sangria, and a bottle of Dos Equis. I was actually surprised that the drinks didn't completely suck! The sangria was too sweet for my liking, but other people seemed to be okay with it. I found the mimosas much better. Prepare to be a go-getter if you want to get your money's worth in drinks! Servers walk around with pitchers of mimosas & sangria so make sure you get their attention if you want a refill.   Food- I couldn't believe you get an appetizer AND entree for such a low price! After actually tasting the food, I was no longer so shocked.. The food wasn't awful, but it reminded me of mediocre diner food. I liked that each course had both savory and sweet dishes to choose from. Each table is given a complimentary basket of mini muffins and jam to start, which was a pleasant and tasty surprise. I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Mushroom & Goat Cheese Omelette. Soup was fine. I found the omelette too buttery, a tad sickening, but the yummy goat cheese kind of masked it. I had a taste of my boyfriend's Eggs Benedict and would choose that dish next time instead. I have to say, my entire table of 7 people were pissed at how cold the side of potatoes were; they totally must have been sitting out all day long. Decor- Cute! So even though the food was nothing special, it's a nice environment to be in to eat & drink. The ground floor has a more sporty feel with tv's and a bar, while upstairs has a more romantic family friendly vibe.Overall, if you are looking for a cheap fun afternoon with friends, The Brass Rail is the perfect choice! Just mentally prepare your tastebuds for a not-so-good experience. But hey, there's no where else in Hoboken that you can get bottomless brunch for such a cheap price.

The salad was, well, salad. The crepe - you just can't mess up chocolate fluff and graham crackers on a crepe. So that was good. The eggs Benny not so much. The eggs were poached well and were funny but the hollandaise sauce was meh. I've had better. Also when i ordered a coffee it was like ice cold.

We went for dinner on Friday night & were led up their spiral staircase to a quieter dining room than the loud bar area downstairs. They have great options for appetizers and a creative cocktail menu. We enjoyed the warm burrata to start. We ordered the salmon with bok choy and it was cooked perfectly; not overdone as too many restaurants do. We also tried the lamb which was fall-off-the-bone and delicious. We were too full for dessert, but their dessert menu looked good as well as their selection of after dinner drinks. Will definitely return!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

We asked to be sat upstairs, which is a little more refined and has a more intimate, quiet feel. They obliged and we ascended the large wooden staircase in the rear to a quiet dining area. First off, our server, Morgan was outstanding from beginning to end. Really, one of the best servers I've had maybe anywhere. She was pleasent, attentive, and really seemed to have a wonderful knowledge of the menu. Now, the food. I had the pleasure of choosing the Truffle Meatballs and Gnocchi and my wife can attest, I not only ate the entire thing but used the bread to sop up the sauce. My wife had the Trumpet Mushroom Risotto which was out of this world. You can tell a great chef by the way they prepare risotto and this was top notch. The rest of our party cleaned their plates and left not only well nourished but not overly stuffed. It was just right.

I've been walking past it in Hoboken for years and finally decided to give their brunch a shot. Now that I know how amazing it is, I'm sad about all the time i wasted when i could've be coming to BR! We came with a large group of around 12 people who all arrived at different times. The wait staff were very accommodating and sat us once we had a good sized group. They even started bringing out mimosas for everyone before our whole party was there. The service was excellent the whole time.For food I did the two course brunch and started with lemon crepes and chose the steak and eggs as my main. The crepes were extremely light and airy; a perfect starter. I took a bite of someone else's banana parfait and the falafel bites too. All the food was excellent. The parfait ""yogurt"" is like this creamy fluffy mousse. I would def order that starter next time.For the entrees almost everyone at the table got steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to a nice medium, just how i ordered it. The fries were yummy and my poached eggs had perfect runny yolks. I was only sad that I wasn't hungry enough to finish it all! The bottomless boozy brunch is the way to go. I've done many of these in the city and usually the waitstaff are inattentive and pushy about rushing the table out of the restaurant. Brass Rail didn't make us feel rushed at all and we never had a problem getting refills. A+ service and yummy bar food in a nice atmosphere.

You have two options $19 for a starter and entree and $30 for the same plus bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. I opted for the food only. With the $19 you are not offered complimentary coffee or soft drinks those are extra. Seems a bit steep in my option. I got the sweet potato and ricotta crepe as my first order, was very bland with no flavor and was pretty small. Would have expected more!As my main dish I chose the eggs Benedict however since I don't eat bacon I chose the Salmon which was an additional $7.... That's crazy! The potatoes were over seasoned and cold. The eggs looked good at first but once I cut into them they still had uncooked white.  So at this point I have myself a $26 bunch that is so underwhelming it made me sick. At least offer coffee for your guests in the $19 pre fix it would help soften the blow of your over priced crap food. I'm not pretending to be a critic, I am however a 12 year restaurant worker who expects to get what  they pay for. If you don't need to drink with your brunch go someplace else.

I ate some of it until I noticed THE RAW CHICKEN. Two pieces were about 80% uncooked and one larger piece was 100% uncooked. I showed the server the raw meat and he quickly whisked the plate away without saying much. I so regret not taking a photo of the raw meat, especially after the manager (female, dark hair) tried to claim that ""the chicken was just mushy from absorbing the juices from the dish."" Absolute lies- I cook chicken often and I know 100% pink raw chicken when I see it. The manager was also speaking really low and continuously glancing over at the patrons at the table next to ours to make sure they didn't hear what was happening, so clearly she knew they effed up. She agreed to take my raw dinner off of our bill after we went back and forth arguing for several minutes. I also want to mention that the restaurant was pretty dead at the time, so it's not as if this mistake occurred because it was super busy.Shame on you, brass rail. Just ... shame.Edit: I don't appreciate this establishment calling me a liar in their response to my review. My friend and I BOTH saw and were appalled by raw chicken in my food. If they really felt that the food was cooked, why didn't they bring the dish back out to show it to us and prove us wrong?

The only slight negative was the food was just ok. I had the lobster Eggs Benedict, which came out a little on the cool side on toast that was difficult to get my knife through. The little side salad on the plate seemed like a waste because it came with no dressing and just got in the way. Again, the taste wasn't bad but it could have been a lot better. Overall, a decent restaurant experience and a good location for a Sunday morning date. Just have to improve on the food a bit.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

When we were seated (and even when we left), the dining area was maybe half full, yet they crammed everyone into one corner of the room. We had maybe six inches in any given direction between us and the neighboring table. Even the servers had to shimmy between tables to get to people.

148,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,3.0 star rating,"Food: B-I came here with a friend for lunch about a week or two ago. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with cannellini beans, chorizo, carrots, celery, onions and kale. I love salmon - it's my fav. But my meal here was only alright. The salmon was a bit overcooked for my taste as I prefer mine cooked medium with the center still tender. However, it was seasoned well, and I enjoyed the light soupy kind of sauce it came in (with the chorizo and veggies). I felt like it was a healthy option, which was just what I was looking for that day. I got the Nutella crème brulee, which was AMAZING, and it came in a large portion - enough to feed 2 (we didn't even finish it). One thing to note - I did find what seemed like a rock in my food (the salmon entrée)... I was chewing my food when I bit on it and had to spit it out.Service: B+The service here was good - when I pointed out the rock to our waiter, he went to speak to the chef and came back to explain that it must be some part of the pork in the chorizo, which wasn't made in-house. The rock-like thing was the color of the chorizo, so I had already assumed that I found it in my food because some of the bone from the pork got processed and included in the chorizo, but the way he was talking about it made it kind of seem like he was suggesting that it was edible, which it definitely was not. But he was quite nice about it, apologizing and offering a dessert on the house. I wasn't really looking for anything in return by telling him about the problem with the chorizo (just felt like they should know for their future patrons), but when he recommended the Nutella crème brulee, my jaw dropped and I had to have it :)Ambiance: B  (outside: A, inside upstairs: C)It was quieter in Hoboken at the time since it was a weekday, and we chose to seat ourselves outside since it was one of the first nice, spring days in March - warm and sunny with just a light breeze. It was truly beautiful out, and their outdoor seating area was cool and casual, perfect for relaxing and catching up with an old and close friend. I particularly liked that their outdoor seating area wasn't too separated from the rest of the restaurant - they have those window doors that fold to the side so that you could walk right outside from inside the restaurant and those sitting indoors could also enjoy the weather. However, I've been seated in the upstairs area of the restaurant as well (see below), which I didn't think was nearly as nice (less natural light, felt slightly more cooped up). So the feel of this place is very different depending on where you're seated (or ask to be seated).Brunch: CI've actually been a patron of The Brass Rail on two occasions - the first was a birthday brunch, and the second was this lunch. Just a note - for the brunch, they have a bottomless option, which my group opted for. You should keep in mind - if you're a rowdy group looking to reallyyy day drink, this is not the place for you. They keep an eye on you here and really moderate the amount of alcohol they're giving you. They will only serve you just enough and refill your glasses in moderation throughout your meal. I'd say it's good for a casual brunch with a friend and you want to have a drink or two, not good for a birthday brunch where you'd want your friends to get a good buzz going.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"
149,UIIFf__832sl86Wpu2AKZg,Orrin H.,1.0 star rating,"First I'd like to start with this- every BAD review you read about this place- def spot on. I've been living in Hoboken (blocks away from the middle of Washington$ for almost 3 years... I've been to every place in Hoboken and I used to live in greenpoint bk.. And still work in the east village/ williamsburg. I know good food. The Brass Rail is the biggest rip off and worst food I've ever eaten in Hoboken. I went for a lunch, not only were the ""hostess"" and ""waitress"" rude and acted stressed and busy (though we were one of two tables in the whole place) the menu was ridiculously expensive. I don't mind paying for what is deserved.. So I bit the bullet and decided it must be ""upscale"". The result was 2 drinks (one made wrong) an ""appetizer"" that was a crappy jumble of three ingredients completely different in temperature and texture (I swear to god it was like Luke warm pork belly, cold raisins and lettuce, and fucking cornflakes or something as ridiculous) a Coke for my son and then a $100+ bill. I was astounded... I walk in to your place of business with a great attitude a wallet full of money, a want for a place to come regularly as a local, and an educated palate.. And I got a hostess that acted like  I shouldn't be there (I'll add I have a bodysuit of tattoos from fingers to throat.. Maybe I was being profiled and she didn't want ""my kind"" there).. A waitress that stumbled through every forced description of the ""specials"" and had no answers to my questions about said food... To get plates of food that looked like a 5 year old was cooking for hipsters. And a bill like I went to a 5 star steakhouse. Insane. Bonus level- I brought a date there SPECIFICALLY to make fun of the lame attempt at being a hipster brooklynite organic foraged free ranged non gmo ""look we have animals with hats and handlebar moustaches on our signs"" bar/lounge/etc. I provided the previous critique to her and we sat the whole time ""enjoying"" the exact same experience I had before. In fact my date was appalled on how dead on my words were.. As AGAIN.. Our hostess, waitress, and food were so bad I looked around thinking ""I must be on an episode of portlandia! Where's the camera??"". Bottom line.. The only people you see eating here are people that eat McDonald's and Wendy's every day and decide to ""treat themselves"" to some hap-hazard ridiculous ingredients that don't go together at all and don't because every chef that has any training knows better, or those that want to walk in a place and feel like they just walked into someone's bedroom uninvited while they are breaking up with their significant other. Thank you Brass Rail for being total assholes to me, being condescending acting like because I'm heavily tattooed I have no sense of manners or class or taste, then serving me literally the worst food I've ever had in a sit down establishment..TWICE. I understand everyone has bad days.. We all do.. But I gave them more than one chance. Let's say this...they are so bad.. That me, my friends AND children laugh when we walk by. Again- every bad review you see... It's real.  Also- I'd like to add, I'm not into people emotionally ruining a company because they are pissed- I wrote this review a while ago... Almost a year? Then saved it.... So if I felt the same later I could re read it and decide if I wanted to really say all this- yes. I re read it from a year ago, tried again- and BOOM- I still feel every part of this article is relevant. Even worse they started advertising their chef was on the show ""Chopped"" and upped their prices. A few of my close friends are food network chefs... And I'm calling bullshit. What world level chef associates them selves with a place that treats their clients like they don't deserve the food they are serving- then serves icebergs lettuce with cold pork chunks, Frosted Flakes and raisins ? The wait staff was incredibly un-knowledgable and condescending to me, and I actually showed up hoping for an actual ""decent meal"". Again, I've been to every single spot in Hoboken over many years and this place needs to step aside and make room for a spot that actually gives 2 fucks about serving good food instead of faking an image. Honestly, this review seems harsh, but I gave them 3+ chances to treat me like a human being and serve me decent food with decent service. Each time they treated me like I should be taking out their trash instead of dining there, served me horrid food at a snails pace, then hand me a bill that looks like I must have bought a limo to get there. You think they would be extra careful to treat locals with respect... But no.

Their red sangria is perfect.I didn't love their falafel appetizer, but I usually like to start with a salad anyway and those are always on point.The steak and eggs entree is delicious. They change their menu with the seasons, so I actually haven't tried anything else on their current brunch menu but I probably will on the next nice weekend day.  It's the most fun when you can sit outside!They also have a pretty nice lunch deal - 3 ""tastings"" for $15.  Some of the tastings are very small, while others are pretty filling. For example the soup is a full cup (French onion soup is very tasty), and the salads are generally a nice portion. The sandwiches are slider sized, which is perfect when you are ordering 3 different things. The grilled octopus is awesome, but very small. The skirt steak lettuce wrap is pretty good, but also pretty tiny. The first thing I ever had for dinner here was their truffle meatballs with gnocchi in a sherry cream sauce. This is still one of my favorite dishes in any restaurant in Hoboken! Seriously amazing. Because I love it so much, I haven't tried any other dinner entrees here, but I probably should because a bunch of them look really delicious as well!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

157,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,4.0 star rating,"In general, I really like this place and go often when I'm in Hoboken, hence the 4 stars. I think the food is good and they offer a good selection of cocktails and spirits. However, I went for brunch the other day and wasn't too impressed. For brunch, you have the option of a. $19 for an app and an entree or b. $30 for an app, an entree, and unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or red sangria while there. This deal lasts until 3pm on Sunday. When we arrived, they took us upstairs and sat us down right away. The place was packed and so loud I couldn't even hear myself think. I guess this is the place to be for brunch on a Sunday in Hoboken! Anyway, we sat down and asked if we could have a mimosa until the rest of our party arrived. He said he would allow us 1. Fair enough. Two more girls came and we sat waiting around for awhile before the waiter finally came back (granted, we now had 4 instead of the 6 we had promised). When we finally tracked him down we asked for more mimosas and some corn muffins. They both took a fairly long time. Finally got the mini muffins with raspberry jelly, and I asked if we could have butter too. I think I asked 15 times to 3 different people. FINALLY, got the butter. GRRR.Overall, I thought the brunch menu was a bit limited (similar to most places), but what I had was tasty. They give you a variety of app options from oatmeal, yogurt, and other breakfast options to salads and soups. I went with the French Onion soup, which was tasty. After that, I had the fried egg BLT with egg whites and a salad instead of fries, which they gave to me no problem. The BLT was good, I liked the avocado and alfalfa sprouts on my multigrain toast, it felt pretty healthy. General consensus, I still really like this place, but I think I'll stick to happy hour and dinner instead of brunch. While the food was good, the service was pretty spotty and I ended up getting agitated with the waiter a few times, maybe he was just super busy, who knows. The mimosas seemed to have very little alcohol in them too :(",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

Why did it take over 10 minutes for us to get water? We shared the Beef Tartare and Chorizo Pizza. The Beef Tartare, mustard, capers, the usual. It was tasty and classic- I just felt like it was missing something. I can't put my finger on it. The Chorizo & Ricotta pizza was more like a well done flatbread, and we both found it very dry. The sprinkles of chorizo drizzled over it was the greatest disappointment of the meal. There was soooo little meat. The service was terrible because it was allll over the place. We got sat by one person, a different person (who I can only assume was a manager based on what he was wearing) took our order, a third delivered the food, a fourth lady (who was very nice) came to check on us, and then yet another person (who had a very shitty attitude) delivered our check.

The 3 star on yelp didn't help either but I was forced by some friends and I am glad that I went. Since it is Hudson restaurant week, I decided to opt for the ""safe"" choices because how can you go wrong. If your ""safe choices"" are bad, it is at least edible. If it's superb than you know everything on the menu will reflect that. First course, I had the calamari. It was fresh-crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They were huge pieces as well. It came with a Thai chili vinaigrette that was really good. It was light and tangy not like our normal thick sauce. Main course I had the garlic rubbed skirt steak with spinach and skinny crispy potatoes topped with mushroom and bleu cheese. It was juicy and flavorful. Last course, the nutella creme brulee. Whoever thought of this was a genius. I was so full but I could not put my spoon down! Overall, I really loved everything I had and I would definitely come back and try other dishes. The portions were decent as well.Besides the food, I would say service was great considering they were busy. The employees were nice and attentive.

Our server was friendly and attentive, despite the fact that there was a rather rowdy party of about 15 right next to us. He knew the menu well and was able to make recommendations, which is always appreciated.We started with the roasted octopus appetizer, which was delicious. The octopus was cooked really nicely - not rubbery at all - and it was a generous portion for an appetizer. For entrees, we had the ginger garlic salmon, the 24-hour braised lamb shank, shrimp & asparagus risotto, and a special of the day, a mahi-mahi over truffle risotto. The only mild disappointment was with the lamb shank; it wasn't quite as fall-off-the-bone tender as we were expecting, and as the server explained, it was cooked sous-vide, so it was a bit lacking in flavor and richness. But that being said, it was still a good dish.All of the other entrees were phenomenal. Salmon and mahi-mahi were both well cooked, and all of the accompaniments (veggies, sauces, etc.) were flavorful and well-balanced. The truffle in my risotto wasn't overpowering, and the texture of both risotto dishes was great. Portions were good as well.Dessert was nothing special - I've had better profiteroles and tres leches elsewhere, but they were by no means subpar. The chocolate mousse was decadent without being too heavy.Overall, I was impressed by the excellent service and the balanced, interesting, and flavorful food we had at The Brass Rail.

I wish I could say it is worth a 2nd try, but the prices and the quality just weren't there to warrant that.I got the spicy chicken sandwich and fries. The fries were a little under-seasoned, but probably the best part of the meal. The chicken sandwich wasn't a whole chicken breast which is what I kind of expected. It was thick sliced chicken breast, not deli thin but like Thanksgiving Turkey leftovers. It had no ""buffalo"" sauce really whatsoever, plenty of bleu cheese and the avocado helped balance out some flavor. Other than that the chicken was dry and overall bland.My wife got tortellini wrapped scallops. She didn't like it at all, she said everything tasted ""frozen"". The tortellini looked clear and just meh. The scallops were iitttttty bitty. The peas and carrots surrounding it looked like, and as she said, tasted like, right out of a can. I don't eat seafood so I didn't try it, but the presentation was really sub par.The service was spectacular I can't take that away from them and the place is great inside, lively and nice decor.

We work just steps away from this restaurant and decided to go after work. The hostess was on point and didn't let us wait long.. she made it happen. We sat down outside and the waitress was really nice.. I believe her name was Susane J. We ordered our Oysters (3$ each). We don't mind paying the $3 but the oysters were so small (so dissapointing). We only ordered 6 for $15.. if they were worth more then we defintely would want to order more. Besides that I had ordered the sweet and sour duck.. (don't order it) big mistake.. was the worst I've ever had ($18) down the drain. My sister ordered the Skirt Steak and it was good but they added so much blue cheese all over that it took the goodness after a few bites. My sister said, it wasn't worth it. My niece was so hungry that we had to feed her as much of the meat possible or else we had said something (they were so busy). Oh and the duck soup only had like 3 pieces of duck.. geez.. I only ate the duck and left the rest. After that we were still hungry and we had to stop by the Crepe place on Washington to fill us up and to get that soup taste off my mouth.The bill came up over 100 not including the tip. My sister said, the best part was her 2 drinks. I didn't drink alcohol and had a soda.With the bill there was a comment card. I left my comment with my number in case they wanted ot follow up with me.

Bf did get the fritata and I tried some- it was quite hearty, with lots of thickly cut artichoke in it. Yum.  The home fries were good too- largely diced potato pieces. My other two friends got the egg white mushroom and spinach omelette (not extra with egg whites) which was said was satisfying - same home fries.

195,96fu8hsCzeIqCCvjbgEd3g,Ed Z.,1.0 star rating,"We have been to the Brass Rail many times over the past few years and have had an OK to very nice experiences each time.  We ate there on Thanksgiving and had one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant.  After waiting for a very  long time at our reserved table and our drink order finally being taken by the hostess (after we complained), we had the pleasure of dealing with an incompetent waiter who barely had a clue as to the basics of his job. This guy actually wanted us to order our desserts in advance of the meal!!  When we told him we would decide if we want desserts and if so, order them at the conclusion of our meal he stood there and rudely read off what all of the dessert choices were and ignored what I had just told him.  He was unfriendly, unprofessional and a tremendous turn off to deal with.  The bland and boring turkey dinner consisted of extremely small portions that actually looked like a lunch plate and not a Thanksgiving dinner by any measure.  These servings were just tiny and much smaller then what was served to us every other time we had been there, including two other Thanksgiving reservations in prior years.Then the real problem occurred.  We were subjected to a situation in which we were overcharged and the management refused to correct the situation and refund the amount of the over charges!All of our drinks were purchased within the time of their happy hour during which they offer half prices on all draught beers from 4-7 Monday Through Friday.  We did not realize it when we were there but this gem of a waiter charged us full price for each and every pour.  When I called and spoke with the manager (after sending an email the very next morning to which I received NO response for days) I was informed by the manager that they ""do not issue refunds"".  What in the world  do you mean you do not issue refunds??  You over charged ME and the refund money is MINE, not  yours!  This is a sign of complete indifference or incompetence on the part of this manager.  Under no circumstances do you treat a customer this way.  There is no justification for it especially when we paid  happy hour prices on all draughts during our two prior Thanksgiving visits and there was no mention of any changes on this year's menu!Further, this horror occurred after visiting the Brass Rail at least 15 times over the last four years (this was our third Thanksgiving dinner there) and never, ever complaining about anything in the past as there was no need to.  The people who own / manage this place are not too bright.  All they needed to do was correct the mistake made by this moronic waiter by at very least issuing the refund that was due to me for the overcharges (which is all we asked for) and I would have been satsified and continued to patronize their restaurant.  After the complete incompetence of this so called waiter, the embarrasingly tiny portions (in place of what were robust holiday meal sized portions in the past) and absolutely no concern or resolution from the management,  I would never again go there.  I would also advise others to take notice of  the large amount of negative reviews they have received here on Yelp and other places.  Be sure also to read the ""not currently recommended"" reviews  to further see what others have been saying about their experiences here.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

FYI: If you only have drinks and apps but don't have dinner, the policy is to ask you to leave the table. I guess this is important for the summer months but the delivery of the message is so rude that it is off putting. Also they take no responsibility for food errors. This summer we had a monk fish entree with fish that was overcooked and shriveled into a dry sponge.  We asked to send it back. The server brought over the head hostess. She did not bother to apologize and was generally unfriendly. She just asked if we wanted something else. We decided not to bother since it took so long for someone to help us with the issue.They have a beautiful restaurant but that does not make up for subpar food and indifferent servers.

Of course, I went with two other people for the $30 bottomless drinks (mimosas, sangria, etc.) and the two course menu. Seemed like a great deal, but once you actually see and taste the food it makes total sense. This place serves diner food that has glorified menu descriptors. I had the French onion soup which is typically rather salty- this had minimal taste. I then ordered the BLT which was basic and rather difficult to mess up. The fries were randomly pretty good. But my boyfriend ordered the chicken and egg quesadilla- what a waste. It was literally the tiniest quesadilla I've ever seen. One small tortilla folded over. When we opened a triangle up, it was three small chunks of chicken and some shiny neon orange shredded supermarket cheese. We actually sent it back because it was embarrassing. I'm actually going to assume that's not how it's typically served. I switched and let my boyfriend eat the BLT. The waitress (who never made eye contact when dropping food or talking to us) didn't put up any fight when returning the food which was nice. I ordered the grilled salmon with risotto. It was interesting. I wish I had taken a photo of it. It was basically a 6oz piece of grilled salmon on top of some runny, oily 'risotto' for a lack of better words. It came in a plain white bowl, no garnish, nothing. Guess the chef was not happy about the send back. My guests said the salmon smelled and looked extremely weird, I ate it and it tasted okay. Some complimentary little dry muffins with raspberry jam are supposed to come to the table, but ours never did until we asked. I gave it two stars for the atmosphere which is nice. The hostess was fantastic, a thin brunette with some facial piercings I don't remember. She squeezed our table in quickly despite giving a long wait time estimate and was super friendly.

Of course I read the Yelp reviews ahead of time and they're mixed. Atmosphere:The first thing you notice when you walk in the door is the noise level. This place is loud. We sat in the ""main"" dining area is upstairs (nice because it gave it somewhat of a restaurant feel, as opposed to feeling like I went to dinner in a bar) and there were several tables already seated and one large party. Someone else wrote a review said you practically have to shout in order to talk - they're right. The noise level is ridiculous. The place is more casual than I anticipated. I'm glad I didn't dress up and just wore something I'd wear to a night at a bar. Service:Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. I wasn't sure which beer I wanted so she brought me a sample of a new beer they just got in. The name escapes me. It was good. Similar to a Stella but a bit more fruity. Food:He ordered the calamari and I had the Caesar salad. Both were delicious. The dipping sauce for the calamari was VERY good. Salad was crisp and well tossed with dressing. For our dinners he had the garlic rubbed skirt steak, which he enjoyed. I don't like medium well but I thought it was cooked well as the piece I had wasn't dried out and was very flavorful. I had the fettuccini and grilled chicken. This was also very good but I was expecting it to be a bit saucier. It was a little bland until I added some salt. He had chocolate ice cream as dessert and I had the pear and honey sorbet. That was a great choice. It was palette cleansing and very good.

Most of the cheese on the menu wasn't in stock, so we chose at random. When my wine came, it tasted completely different from my first glass. The waiter assured me it was the same Pinot Grigio, just from a new bottle. I knew otherwise, but rather then be a bother I decided just to drink it. When the cheese plate came, it was a complete disappointment. Not well presented and such a small portion. We decided to try the French onion soup, and ordered one last glass of wine each. When my wine came, it was the correct type this time, confirming what I had suggested to the waiter previously about him bringing the wrong blend last glass. Finally the French onion soup. Terrible. One bite was enough. What was most frustrating for us, is that we had two different waiters, both whom were inattentive.  It took the waiter 15 mins to ask us how our soup was.

Was waiting for my party to arrive so had a drink at the bar. The bartender was quite friendly and made my Bloody Mary percent. Was pretty quiet initially but picked up as noon neared. We sat outside and all four of us ordered the pre-fix. $30 gets you an app, entree and bottomless drinks, which get refilled really quickly. Each app looked better than the next, but I settled with the strawberry banana parfait and was quite pleased. Other choices within our party included the smore donut holes and lemon marscapone crepes. For entree, I was tempted to go with the peanut butter and jelly waffle but instead decided to go with the eggs florentine with smoked salmon....it was the prefect choice. Presentation of everything was amazing and cadence between courses was on point. Our server was so on top of it, and even brought us a plate of olives for free. In total, I probably had about 8 bloody Mary's that were quite delicious...not an easy fete. After brunch we made our way back over to the bar for some beers and sangria. Served with a smile.

We were seated in the second floor area, which is much classier and quieter than the bar downstairs. I ordered my usual brunch favorites: a Caesar salad and grilled salmon with roasted vegetables. This may be the only place that recommends ordering salmon medium rare, as their salmon is sushi-grade. As always, my dishes did not disappoint. The Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, with light shavings of Parmesan cheese. And the salmon was cooked perfectly and had a sweet buttery texture. The veggies were good too, although they slightly burnt the artichoke. My boyfriend was not thrilled with his meal, sadly. He ordered French toast with fruit compote, and he called it ""underwhelming"". I didn't try any, but I'm fairly certain he wasn't keen on his dish because he was getting over a cold and his taste buds weren't exactly up to par yet. His mom loved the mushroom and cheese omelette though.Word of caution to any potential patrons: don't come to The Brass Rail for a quick bite if you're running low on time.

Every manager, server, bartender I've come in contact with has been so accommodating, professional and kind which I really appreciate. Let's get the worst out of the way - the cocktails are terrible! I don't know why it's infuriating to me - I guess because if you're going to charge $10+ I'm expecting a good drink.Almost every time I've ordered a cocktail I have sent it back. I know better now and just stick to wine/beer.  Drinks are all sweeter than the description lets on, and menu is uninspired. Why no mulled wine or other seasonal cocktail? It's decorated so nicely for the holidays and I can't get a nice cozy drink? I once ordered a sangria which tasted more like fruit punch sugar water served in a water glass with ice without fruit. I didn't even bother sending that one back. I am begging you: PLEASE hire a barista to redo the entire cocktail list along everything associated with it! Food is ok. The menu is kind of all over the place. I had the salmon last night. Texturally the dish was off everything was soft, but flavors were there. I've had a million better salmon dishes.

I've been to Brass Rail for catered large scale dining and for their AYCD brunch special. Both of those dining experiences were fantastic. The fish was well done (and by ""well done"" I do not mean over cooked) and the appetizers were to die for. For the brunch special I went with the quiche and the lump crab nachos - you must have the guacamole! Since I was a fan of Brass Rail I decided to hit up their $12 lunch special which was billed as a Hudson ""Restaurant Week"" lunch. I wasn't so impressed... the French Onion soup I had was awful, but they quickly brought me my second choice of potato salad, which was decent. I also went with a skirt steak sandwich, and the tomato/pancetta/motz ""salad"" was 'meh.'

It has such potential given its location, beautiful bar and ambiance, but the food just doesn't match up. I've been here for both dinner and brunch and neither was very appealing. Overall, the food lacks flavor, everything is just kind of mediocre or bland. The burger was just OK - nothing to write home about. The french onion soup is also just OK - it didn't have amazing crusty cheese or a bold taste. It was just soup. And don't even think about getting the crispy falafel. It was probably one of the worst foods I have ever eaten. It lacks any sort of ""crispiness"" and basically tastes like wet bread. The bar is a completely different story. There's a decent selection of beer on draught, inventive cocktails and the bloody marys are actually delicious. There's a pretty good unlimited drinking brunch deal which is worth getting if you're getting your drink on. Service is good; nothing spectacular but nothing terrible either. They get the job done.

So on monday, we both had off and I decided to drive down with her and walk around. After attempting to bar hop we stumbled upon The Brass Rail which was very inviting with its outdoor seating and view of a neat, clean, sexy looking bar. Of course we went in and sat down at the bar. It was just before dawn and the breeze between the rotating fans above and the open doors was comfortable and delightful. Made me feel happy we went into this bar. And the liquor display was very eyes catching also. Its nice to be able to see everything on the shelf. Soo, you never know what to expect from a bartender, especially in hoboken. Either they are just too busy to give a crap or they really just dont. Or you have a friendly bartender like Lindsay who was happy to make us a few specialty cocktails and discuss spirits and drinks with us within our first 15 minutes there.  I asked for a Vesper and she said shes not sure if we have Lillet but she will check. Turns out there was jusy enough for one more drink and i made the cut! I was very excited and she made it so perfectly, i felt like James Bond! My lady friend asked her opinion of 2 drinks that she was eyeing and Lindsay gave her honest opinion and suggested one of The Brass Rails specialty cocktails. She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and had the drinks that we wanted. Instead of bar hopping we decided to stay because Lindsay was good company and we wanted to try some food and have another drink.  The fried calimari was just awesome. Nice size pieces cooked perfectly almost like scallops, very tender and very fresh as Lindsay explained that they get fresh calimari a few times a week. I was blown away by the calimari because most calimari is pretty typical when fried...Either crispy or chewy. But this was just perfectly seasoned and cooked with a chili dipping sauce. So again Lindsay went out of her way to make me a cocktail of her choice when I asked what I should have next. I told her gin for the season and she made me her own cocktail idea which was really good. Thanks again Lindsay for the great service, skilled mixology and good company. I'd be happy to hsve some food and get drunk at the Brass Rail again. And i will...soon! I then claimed that this is one of the best bars in Hoboken. But idk if i can make that claim yet.

Brass Rail offers two choices; at $19 you can get an appetizer and entrée or at $30 you get an appetizer, entrée and unlimited drink choice (Bloody Mary, mimosa, sangria, beer or wine). We knew we were going to have at least two drinks so we opted for the second choice. For the appetizers, I got the strawberry banana parfait and my boyfriend got the crapes. Both were really good and a perfect start to the meal. I would not suggest getting a BMary with a sweet dish; not a good combo on my part. Next I had the breakfast nachos and they were awesome. Didn't realize that they bake the tortilla ships in salsa which makes the chips a little soggy but I didn't even care because it was still flavorful and the chorizo on top adds the perfect amount of saltiness. My guy got the steak and eggs and said that it was also cooked very well and had no complaints.

238,HniHQeuiEOdMjsAwoFu1PA,Maria M.,3.0 star rating,"This is a review of the Sunday brunch only.  I have lived in Hoboken for a little over a year and always see this place packed every weekend so I decided to finally try it out. I was able to easily make a reservation the day before and was promptly seated upon arrival. There are two brunch options. You can get an appetizer and entree for 18 or make it an all you can drink (mimosa, Bloody Mary, red sangria, and beer) for 28. Btw this is notably one of the only places that I have seen serve all you can drink sangria so I was pleasantly surprised. Food: We ordered the Caesar salad and eggs Benedict. Both dishes were delicious and had very simple presentations. The mimosas, Bloody Mary, and sangria were premixed. I found the sangria to be a bit watered down. Meanwhile the mimosas were pretty standard. Ambience: considering it was a pretty chilly day the place was still pretty packed. There is a nice outdoor seating area which is great during the summer. The restaurant has two floors. I came here With a friend and it was a bit hard to hold a conversation as the music was relatively loud on the main floor. There were a number of large groups that came in for a brunch which definitely added to the volume. Having said that I would still recommend this place to a friend but would suggest that it's better for a group of people rather than a pair. Service: We expected to have a wait however found it a little frustrating to have to ask for a refill of our drinks several times before receiving them. We were told that the kitchen was a backed up however still didn't have much of a wait for the food. It was nice to have two meals (app and entree) rather than just one and made waiting for the main course much easier. Overall I will definitely be back. This is a great place in Hoboken to come to once the weather gets nice to sit outside. The two course meal lets you relax and drink for longer than you normally would. The only con I found was the relatively slow service and somewhat watered down sangria. If you have some time to spend and aren't afraid to ask for another drink then you should definitely try this place out.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

No less the 10 min later when we went to order...she told us that we may not be able to order now, unless it's the bar menu. Then she said it was ok. So we ordered, 5 min later she said that we can still get our meal, but we would have to move inside. This was unacceptable so we left. She should have told us before hand.

It was my first time trying rice pudding and I was surprised at how much I liked it! I would definitely recommend it for a dessert rather than an appetizer though because it was on the sweeter side. We were both pleased with our appetizers and it was hard to pick just one. They also had Caesar salad, tuna and mango salad, bread pudding, humus and bagel chips, and some others as appetizer options. I ordered the spinach and mushroom omelet with homefries for my entrée. The homefries were cooked to golden perfection, crispy on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside. The omelet, although very mushroom heavy, was good and had melted white cheddar inside. The omelet was pretty standard in term of quality, but I did polish off the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the French toast. It too was cooked perfectly and drizzled with strawberries. Although not a big French toast fan, it was great.I am planning on returning again just to try their different options like Chilean sea bass, turkey burgers, and much more.

The tiny list is varied and ranged from mini sliders to salads to chips and guacamole. I decided on a mini caprese salad, the steak and cheese slider, and the chips and guacamole. Unfortunately the guacamole felt store bought; too smooth to be home made, but the chips were artisanal. The mozzarella, tomato and crispy bacon caprese was ok--crunchy and soft, bright and also salty. The slider was dry with too much bread and not enough meat. My friend got chicken with asparagus and some kind of creamy barley. It was chewy and heavy and kind of lay flat.The lavender crème brulee was intriguing because of the lavender (flower flavored things are not always available). The lavender was highly aromatic and definitely present on the tongue. The crème brulee was just crème brulee. My friend ordered the profiteroles with chocolate ice cream in the middle. Because I do not like chocolate, I did not try them, but they were really beautiful.  The service was decent. We were the only table occupied in the upstairs dining area.

They were ok taste wise, not a succulent portion, presentation could be improved, the highlight was the dipping sauce. A friend ordered a burger which she said was fine (my friend is a picky eater, she had a really hard time finding something in the menu that was straightforward and simple), The burger was big and my friend said it was a good burger overall. Nothing bad to say about that.I ordered the fish tacos and my husband ordered the kobe beef sliders. My fish tacos, were not that good, nothing special. Just two fish tacos loaded with cilantro (pretty much the only thing you could taste and see), the description included ""crema"" which was definitely missing in action, and to top it off they were almost cold by the time they arrived. I was so hungry I ate them anyways. My husband liked his sliders. We ordered a few drinks without issue. Also, the service left much to be desired, we felt like we were being rushed. My husband gets the check, and does not even have time to look at it and tip, before someone was picking it up (also he was still finishing his sliders), he turned around and told him ""I am a really good tipper if I were you I would not take that back there"" (with a smile of course, he was a server himself back in the day so he is extremely nice to servers under any given circumstance) They apologized and set it back at the table.

262,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"Brass Rail offers quite possibly the best brunch deal in Hoboken.  For a measly $15, you get your choice of appetizer and entree.  I would specifically recommend the prix fixe upsell of an additional $10 for unlimited Bloody Mary's, Bellinis, soft drinks, juices, coffee, etc.  One Bloody Mary alone is $7, so why not go all out!  Believe me, they do not skimp on the alcohol in each one, plus they know how to keep them coming in an endless procession of spicy goodness.  I had such a lovely time on my first visit and have now made this my go-to brunch destination.Each meal is kicked off with a basket of tasty corn and blueberry muffins, served with small jars of various fruit jams.  In terms of the appetizers, I have sampled the Baby Spinach Salad, Gazpacho, and Grilled Shrimp.  The brilliantly fresh and crisp spinach salad was topped with roasted, lean duck meat, cherry tomatoes, and overcooked cauliflower.  It was topped with a tangy mustard vinaigrette.  The Gazpacho was amazingly refreshing with its cold tomato broth and heap of diced peppers and onions.  A mound of crispy tortilla strips were thrown in for added texture.  The Chimchurri Marinated Shrimp were perfectly cooked and served over feta cheese and a guacamole mousse.  When it came to the entrees, the Asparagus and Feta Omelet was extremely delicious and decadent.  Besides the bold feta within the egg envelope, there was another cheesy layer baked right on top of the omelet.  Though it tasted fantastic, it was a bit too much dairy in my opinion.  The accompanying roasted potatoes were greasy, mushy, and served at room temperature.  However, their Cauliflower, Mustard, and Parmesan Quiche was surprisingly light, yet comforting.  The Turkey Burger, topped with melted Swiss cheese and marinaded fresh mushrooms, was the juiciest, most flavorful poultry patty I have ever eaten.Their dessert platter of mixed berries included tangy strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, all at the peak of freshness.The Brass Rail is a must for brunch aficionados...and anyone eager to finish the weekend off with endless morning cocktails!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

I got the blueberry oatmeal w/my mushroom blue cheese omelet and it was divine.  It was lightly sweet due to the crumbs topping and the blueberries, which i like (i cut sugar down).  The omelet was a little overpowered w/blue cheese though.  I liked it still because I love olives and it was my natural salt (along w/the blue cheese) for the dish.I've been here a couple of times for late drinks and it was enjoyable.  There wasn't too much pretentiousness going around, nor the juvenile behavior as well.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

Their old fashions are no joke and the first time I ordered one I lost my man card by not finishing it.  The second time I got my man card back but couldn't remember the rest of the night.All of that's irrelevant, because you really come here for brunch. Highlights:- 25 bucks or so for an appetizer, entree, and ""unlimited drinks""- ""unlimited drinks"" comes with a disclaimer from the waiter that they can't say unlimited but he will do his best to make sure you stumble but don't fall.  Good enough.- Appetizers all looked very good and I went with a crab and watermelon salad.  Fancy guy I know.- Steak and Eggs were very tasty and ensured I would leave with man card since my drink orders were a little suspect- Bloody Marys, Sangria, and Mimosas...many were consumed, all are included, and the waiter was on-point with service- Corn muffin things were okay but essential for survival- Waiter actually said dessert was garbage and not to bother...transparency is good...unless he noticed I was beginning to turn into a zombie and wanted to get rid of me.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

So we went again on a Monday night; place was fairly empty. Few people dining outside and some at the bar watching the Packers Game. We were seated promptly, brought waters and warm pizza bread with pesto sauce to the table. We ordered off the pre-fixed menu. For apps I got the calamari which I personally loved and the sweet and spicy sipping sauce that came with it was great. My bf got the French onion- he gulped it down so I'm assuming it was delicious lol. For dinner the Bf got the Salmon and I got the Tamarind Chipotle Chicken. My bf (who may I say hates salty foods) had to add salt to his meal lol but other than that he said it was really good. My tamarind chicken was a bit spicy for my taste but it had amazing flavor &  the side of mashed plantain & snow peas were AMAZING!! For dessert, I had the Nutella creme brûlée & fb had coconut sorbet which were both good and came with a biscotti. The place was kind of empty, it did take a bit for the server to come attend us but at least this time around our food was good and we weren't ignored as much lol.

Nonetheless, we returned to the scene of the crime tonight and, to their credit, everything was terrific. Service was great. Management was tip-top and the food was some of the best I've had in 'boken. The Wasabi Shrimp appetizer is hands-down the best appetizer in town. Skirt steak was perfect and creme brulee as well.

The decor is cute, definetely more elegant than most places in Hoboken. Service is also great. We had a very sweet and attentive waiter. The food was just OK. I ordered the P.E.I mussels, roasted beet salad and the kobe beef sliders. The mussels were very sandy. Also, there were white beans and escarole added in, but it didn't quite mix. It needed to have more broth. Also, there was no crispy bread to scoop up the broth. The roasted beet salad was fine - You can't mess that up. Lastly, I found the sliders to be delicious - they get a star for that.

We went there last night for Hudson Restaurant Week and upon arriving we had to wait for the hostess to greet us. It took her 10 minutes. No one was manning the front of the house and they definitely lost customers due to it. That was our first indication that service was going to be slow. We wanted to sit outside and noticed that a table was available, it just needed to be cleaned. It took another 15 minutes for them to clean the table off. We decided to have a drink at the bar. Well, service at the bar was extremely slow as well. To keep with the gist of the story, our service was slow once we were seated. The only reason I'm not fully blasting off is because the food was phenomenal! I would endure the slow service all over again just to experience the amazingness that is the Brass Rail. I started off with the mussels, they were SO good. The sauce they use for them is pure goodness. Next, I had the chicken with rigatoni. I wasn't really a fan of my chicken, I found it to be too chewy but the eggplant and tomatoes that accompany the dish were great. Finally, I had the chocolate mousse for desert. I had to remind myself that it wasn't proper to pick the dish up and lick it. It was so good, I could have eaten 6 of them! So the moral of the story is this: The Brass Rail has amazing food, but you're going to be there for over 2 hours to enjoy it.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

Everything was cooked as it should have, which is appreciated, but often leaves a little to be desired in regards to flavor. I ordered the Salmon which was fine enough, but tasted more or less how I usually make it at home. Again - this is fine, but not worth ordering at a restaurant if it all too closely resembles my own creation.Other members of the party seemed to enjoy their food - the venison, which I was able to taste, was very nicely done (even medium, as the person ordered).As another recent reviewer noted, the beer selection is what turns this rating upwards. Second only to Cork City, in my opinion, The Brass Rail is really delivering in the beer department. The Dogfish selection is always pleasing, but it was the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar on draught that really impressed me.

The owner took the time to reach out to me about my latest experience which was commendable and courteous. He corrected the information that our server gave us about the Chef. While there is a new chef, the original one Chef Doug is still the culinary director for the restaurant. Not sure what role that plays exactly but they offered to set everything right on our next visit**Beware - disappointing new chef.Went with the wife for Valentine's day. I was not aware the chef of many years was no longer there until I'd asked for my steak to be prepared au poivre. The last chef always did it no questions asked and it was phenomenal. The new chef flat out refused, I believe my servers words were, ""He said sorry, no changes allowed whatsoever"". The steak was au jus (ie. BORING) and, while cooked properly in the middle, both my wife's and mine were charred on the outside. The accompanying potato lyonaisse were dry and hard, we literally took one bite and pushed them aside. Matter of fact, since our steaks were so disappointing we had them wrapped to go nearly whole and weren't even asked why. We fed the steaks to our dogs :-/  Now we don't plan to eat there anymore, we'll likely try again if we see a new chef at the helm. It's sad as I really liked the old one.Now, for a quick pro/con breakdown:Pros:Good selection of beers on tap and in bottles, friendly/good bar tenders and servers, decent prices, decent looking interior, not so hard to get a table or seat, outside seating during warm seasons.Cons:New chef, quite noisy on lower level, beer glasses often not cleaned well.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

He was not satisfied and told the waitress to take his away and off of the bill completely because he didn't even want it.

He made us feel like intruders.I ordered the filet mignon, which I ordered medium-rare, and specifically asked the waiter if it would be a solid red center, and he said yes.

I had a glass of the white sangria, which was tasty but had a bit too much peach for my liking, so I switched to the pinot noir (there was only one by the glass, but I cannot remember what it was called).  The bread is amazing- tomato basil foccacia, which basically tasted like puffy pizza without the cheese, and delicious basil dipping sauce on the side.  Our appetizer selection, the calamari, was light and crisp, though cut into squares instead of the traditional rings, and served with an asian vinaigrette that was lovely.  My main course, the basil wrapped tuna, was delicious, though the portion was huge.  I thought it was going to come wrapped in Thai basil, but it is actually wrapped in Phyllo-style dough.  I have no idea how they did it, but even though the dough was crisp and cooked, the tuna was the beautiful rare I requested.  The pineapple salsa provided a wonderful sweet balance to the tuna and the earthy brown rice.We were not intending on dessert, but because we were celebrating a birthday, we decided it was a necessity.  Thank goodness we did!  The pound cake french toast dessert was a rich, unique twist that reminded my sister and I of our parents' birthday tradition of serving us ice cream waffles.  The tres leches cake was creamy and decadent and had our table spoonfighting over who could snag the last bite, even as our clothes were basically bursting at seams.This is not a cheap meal, but seven of us had a lovely, special meal and we will most certainly return.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

I started with hummus and bagel chips which were simple and satisfying and finished with the green chicken enchilada. My friend had the quiche with bacon, bourbon, and sriracha, which I had half of, and it was also delicious. It's definitely a fun little brunch spot to hit while in Hoboken and definitely one of the best deals. I'll go back!",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

The service was great, the drinks plentiful, and the giant booth in the upstairs corner was just what we needed.The menu options were way classier than the hangover I was nursing... which is where the unlimited bloody mary's as part of the prix fixe saved the day. I ordered the almond french toast (awesome, super filling, maybe a little on the sweet side) and the lump crab nachos (my bone of contention with this place).To elaborate, nachos by my definition are tortilla chips + cheese + whatever else you feel like throwing on top of them. BR's nachos: chips + crab + I-don't-care-what-else-you-put-on-them-because-there-isn't-any-chesse, WTF. They should more appropriately be billed as chips with cold crab.

Their brunch is an amazing deal as we get two courses with as many drinks as we want, for the time that we are eating. I love their donut holes and their mesclun salad for an app, and their steak&eggs or eggs Benedict as an entree although i do not think you can go wrong with any of their food here. Happy hour is also a steel as i love beer and they offer their beers for half off. They also always have different beers on tap all the time so i never get board drinking the same thing. My personal favorite is the Pranqster which is a golden Belgian ale. The bartender recommended it for me one day, allowed me to sample it, and I've been hooked ever since.   As far as dinner i love the gnocchi and truffle meat balls, the skirt steak, and the risotto carbonara but again, all of their food is really good.

We decided to order from the regular menu. We started with the PEI mussels which tasted old and like sea scum. I had the pan seared scallops-for a $27 meal I was given FOUR SMALL SCALLOPS. A total joke. My bf had the skirt steak which was tasty, but again for the price they maybe gave him a quarter of the steak and sliced it up to make it look like it was more. On top of it all, the bill came to a whopping $80 (mind you, my bf had a soda and I was drinking water). As I was paying the bill I took the paper menu he had left and took a look at the back only to find that the prix fixe was in fact offered on Fridays, it was offered every day of the week!!

Since I am still slightly under the weather I chose the one without: 2 courses.Lovely gazpacho. Gazpacho is probably my favorite soup. Perfect all year round you can only find it during the summer. The gazpacho here is nice and thiick and filled with begies.. Too many places puree it and it looks like cold tomato soup. here it really looks like a nice thick melange of vegies. Good flavor albeit just a little bit too salty. ( The old wives tale is that if the food is too salty, then the chef must be in love).  My secone course: grilled salmon with an assortment of grilled vegetables. A nice sized piece of salmon, grilled to my preference and a lovely assortment of vegies. There is something wonderful about the caramelization of begetables from a grill. The week part of the brunch was the basket of totally non-descript muffins. They do however serve them with really good preserves. Brunch ended with glasses of really fine tasting iced tea and iced coffee.In the end, the bill was a bit highter than I had intended on spending but was certainly worth it.

It's going through a weird identity crisis where the high chairs and slick wooden tables clash with the gigantic signs saying ""COME DOWN FOR HOT 80'S NIGHT, KIDS!"" and the quasi Sports/Dive Bartop. The food tastes like an upscale gastropub, and is priced to boot. It's certainly tasty, with the steak very much a melt-in-the-mouth treatment that, sadly, also melted through the leather in my wallet. The waitresses were quick and courteous, though, and I can't say I was disappointed by the meal itself.

The brunch is a great deal at $15 but an even better deal with the additional $10 for the unlimited beverages, particularly if you're interested in mimosas, bloody maries or Coor's Light. I have a fancy for the blueberry yogurt and the omelette and it makes for a great start to a Saturday. The staff is pretty attentive to your beverage needs, so if you're throwing back the alcohol pretty quickly, you can expect to be refreshed at a healthy pace. Of course, they don't want people sitting there all day so you might be reminded that the unlimited drinks really only apply until your meal is over (with the reasonable post-meal wind down period).

Despite the incredible traffic and unbearable parking my family and I ventured back to my Grandfather's hometown, Hoboken, NJ. My suggestion for brunch was The Brass Rail.  They had an interesting two course prix fixe menu that was very reasonably priced and offered interesting but not over the top options. I must say most of the food was quite good. I ordered the duck confit spinach salad as my first course (nothing to brag about). My boyfriend and aunt had the polenta which had a sausage and tomato chutney drizzled over the top. The polenta did not have much flavor, but the sausage chutney had a nice sweet and spicy kick. For our main courses we chose a chorizo omelet and lemon pepper smoked salmon over sunny side up eggs and brioche toast.  The omelet was cooked to perfection with tons of fresh vegetables and cheeses. The smoked salmon and eggs was ""ehh"".  We ended our meal by sharing two birthday cakes , tres leches for me (my birthday had just passed earlier in the week) and a warm chocolate cake with a white chocolate cheesecake center ( AMAZING) for my  grandfather. My only negative critique of the entire meal was the service.  I hate to give a bad review considering only one component of the meal was poor, but the service we received was truly terrible.  Upon our arrival our server did not give us a warm greeting and we had to ask a million questions to get a straight answer. For example, ""are the infused champagnes on your menu infused with fresh ingredients or flavored liquors??"" Our server had no idea and did not offer to find out an answer.  Next, we were given silverware a few different times; I believe three or four. However, no one was given the correct utensil at the appropriate time.  My grandmother was given a knife and fork with her French onion soup but not with her quiche and actually had to ask for one several times. Furthermore, at the conclusion of our main course, we were not cleared nor were we told that we would be having a new server from that point on. When our new server came over with the check (plates still on the table) my grandmother was very embarrassed and whispered to the waitress that she had ordered two cakes with candles upon our arrival. Our waitress was polite and said she would take care of it. About 15-20 minutes later our cakes came out and were presented to my boyfriend and grandmother (guess someone got the seat numbers wrong !) When our server came over to check on us, which I believe was the only time we were checked on since the start of our meal, without seeking attention ourselves, my grandmother asked that we have our bill right away (our parking meters were just about expired and we were now rushing through what would have been the best part of the entire meal.) She brought us our check in a timely fashion and we left aggravated the entire walk down Washington Street.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

I know that typically Monday nights are the deadest nights for restaurants, but aside from one other couple, the hubby and I were the ONLY ones in the whole place from 8pm - 10:30pm. I went for the food, not the ambiance so that really didn't bother me. We both ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and the filet Mignon for the entree. When they brought the crab cakes out it was tiny. There was one crab cake and then a side of sausage .The sausage was the size of my pinkie. The crab cake was dry and the aoili tasted like it came out of the jar (metallic-like). When the entree came out we were underwhelmed. I asked for medium and they cooked it medium well. They didn't season the steak at all and if they aren't going to age it to perfection they need to season it! The balsamic vinaigrette sauce was sparse and bland. The spinach they provided on the side was virtually useless to eat since it was doused in balsamic.   So all-in-all, I probably would not come here again.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

391,T5qt13EWiDtLT08LG9KQpg,Jonathan C.,1.0 star rating,"Well I eat out in Hoboken frequently and have my go to restaurants where I know I won't be disappointed. I figured since it's Hudson Restaurant Week what better way to introduce myself to a new restaurant and add another to my list. Boy, What a mistake! Granted I know it's a prix fixe menu and they are very busy but to wait over an hour and 15 min for my entree was unacceptable. My waiter was not helpful at all and we waited nearly 20 min for our drinks. I proceeded to order the Salmon dish which I asked how he recommended it cooked and he told me medium. I don't eat too much fish so I didn't know that my salmon would come out basically raw like sushi. I asked the waiter why it wasn't cooked through and he told me that is how they prepare the dish. Almost like a sushi dish. He then told me he should've told me that when I ORDERED. Not for nothing, but if it is my first time there and If I ask him how he recommends a dish it should be told to me BEFORE I order it not after. Why should I have him take it back if I will have to wait another 30-45 min for the dish to get back to me? While my wife is finishing dessert I would have just received my dish. Granted, it's the start of Hudson Restaurant Week but that doesn't mean that the dishes should be of a lower standard. I made them take it back and didn't order anything else. I then asked for the manager to voice my displeasure but that didn't do anything at all. He said that I should have ordered pan fried and not medium. I continued to let him know that I wasn't informed of how medium would come out and he said that is how they cook it there. He didn't offer any solutions to my complaint. THANKED ME FOR MY FEEDBACK and suggested me to come back and try them again. That's it?? That's all that the MANAGER could do. He could've taken out a drink since we paid over $95 for my wife's food and my drink. So my night out at Fabulous Brass Rail consisted of a drink I waited 20 mins for, a raw, undercooked and unsatisfied piece of salmon, and the dessert I just didn't want. What for? IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN WORSE!! I love eating out and trying new restaurants but the standards are not only about the food but the experience. If I have a great experience I wouldn't mind going back every week to enjoy myself and the service. I wouldn't mind spending more for a meal if the experience is unmatched. I am there not only to eat but to enjoy my company, food, and have a lasting memory that I can tell my friends, coworkers and family about. The server, food, and manager left a lot to be desired. I thought maybe the manager would offer some sort of damage control but he only furthered to damage my experience at the Brass Rail in Hoboken, NJ. I wouldn't recommend eating here if you are looking for a dining experience. There are a lot of other top quality service oriented restaurants in town.

(come on dude--foie gras??)I had Broccoli Rabe & Provolone-cheese-stuffed shrimp as an appetizer,  and for my entree, scallops, which were covered in a spicy tomato sauce.To my tastes, there seemed to a lot of strong, confusing flavors and combinations which seemed to cover, instead of compliment  the main ingredients.  I think one needs to be careful about pairing extra-sharp provolone cheese with any food, never mind combining it in a blender with broccoli rabe and stuffing it into shrimp.  In addition, the texture of the stuffing was something akin to baby food.  I had the same experience with my scallops.  Large scallops were paired with sauteed spinach and a delicious piece of cornbread but the whole thing was covered in a spicey tomato, pepper sauce which pretty much destroyed the flavor of the scallops. (but which went quite well with the cornbread)To be fair, the beef-eaters at the table seemed to really enjoy their various dishes (the skirt steak was a big favorite as was the filet) and the service was pretty much amazing.  As far as the food goes, though, the Brass Rail tries too hard for me.",The Brass Rail,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Bars"

The bar menu goes great with the excellent mixed drinks, extensive spirits list, any of the 16 beers on tap (and at least as many bottles) or one of the 100+ bottles of wine (~20 by the glass). Though, if you're hungry for dinner, the price fix is certainly the way to go (and more reasonably priced).The fine-dining menu offers much of the usual - french onion soup, foie gras, calamari, crab cake, salads, chilled seafood appetizers and the expected fish, poultry and beef mains with occasional game. You won't find many experimental or eccentric dishes that blow you away, but you will find well-crafted modern american food with solid traditional foundations.The Brass Rail also turns out a great price fix brunch (app and main) for $15 on Sat and Sun afternoon. The appetizers are all delicious and beautifully presented. The mains are more hit and miss, and you'll find only a few typical brunch entrees.
