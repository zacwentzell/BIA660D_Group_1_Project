This place really specializes in providing tasty non authentic food to soak up all of the alcohol you WILL drink here. That being said, this place gets 4 stars because it is a really fun place to go to happy hour or to get drinks with friends. The food is tasty and reasonably priced for just snacking with friends. Their happy hour special with half priced apps and margaritas makes this a really great place for hanging out. The margs are pretty strong and some flavors are better than others but you can tell by taste that the point of these drinks is for alcohol content not quality of ingredients",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"
1,bLPbuTUXrVk7WdbgfwHwJw,Zak W.,3.0 star rating,"Their drinks and happy hour is great! I came here on a Friday right during the last hour of happy hour. The drinks are strong but also tasty. Prices were competitive and there's a lot of flavors to choose from if you're getting a Margarita. The place is quite small so it gets packed really quick. The food was just ok though. I ordered the enchiladas, queso, an appetizer platter, and cheese quesadillas. Queso was kind of gritty. Enchiladas ok. I liked the appetizer platter a lot due to it being half-pricd for happy hour. It was weird that an 18% tip was automatically included even though I only had a party of two. I think this is enforced during happy hour but I could be wrong. I like and dislike this. It's good as far as ensuring servers are being compensated but was also weird being forced to tip. My server was great so this wasn't really an issue. I'd definitely recommend this place.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

I loved the pomegranate flavor which was a recent discovery for me. I normally don't go for the pitchers because I like to order a different kind every time seeing as how they have a long list of flavors on the menu. To be honest, I'm all about the drinks when I come here, but I've tried the chimichangas and flauticas. The flauticas were good, skinny flautas cut in halves. It came with a side of three sauces that I could do without. The chimichanga was also flavorful, you can choose chicken or beef. It's basically a deep fried burrito. They also start you off with complimentary chips and salsa. The atmosphere here is super casual and it's a little on the smaller side even for hoboken, but service is friendly and fast.

The tortilla soup was actually one of the best we have ever had- we were surprised but it was filled with fresh chunks of avocado, chicken, and cheese and also had some tortilla strips on top for crunch. It was delicious. We also tried the chimichanga and the taco salad. Both were good- not the best we have ever had but standard. Service was good!

5,y_LETSyVwMVKbMSHwHDioQ,Erin A.,2.0 star rating,I don't like to judge places based on reviews so I decided to give this place a chance. Moral of the story always listen to reviews ! They have nice out door seating which is a plus. But they made my dog stay on the other side of the fence. Poor pup.They bought him water which was nice The prices aren't terrible.I got the combo veggie taco and veggie burrito 13 dollars. The waiter asked if I was vegetarian and told me the rice was made with meat broth. that was nice he was aware of that! My boyfriend got some sort of meat tacos. The wait was long for the food. It about 30 minutes. Which is pretty crazy. It's tacos and burritos... For drinks I got the mango frozen margarita. I felt like it tasted odd. Different from usual margaritas I get. I consider myself a margarita expert... sort of..  Not like it was strong it just weird tasting. Was not a fan.The food was so average it's not even funny. For a 30 + minute wait you would think it would be spectacular or something.Mine was literally grilled veggies in a wrap with some cheese. Mind blown. My boyfriend did not enjoy his either.  I'll probably have to get different food after this because well... I'm still starving. Perhaps they need to fix this efficiency and food quality.  47 dollars for a long wait and food/drink we hated... oyyAlways listen to yelp reviews!!Spare yourselves.,East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

I would like to say to some people who do give this place 1 star because of thier ""loud music"" and ""over crowdedness"" (idk if thats even a word but Eff it)1. If you walk in and the place is too loud for your taste why not just turn around and go else where? I mean it's common sense isn't it. 2. If the place is too crowded and u hate crowded places. Why torture yourself and ask for a seat. Once again common sense. 3. If the place is ""not fancy"" not ""anything special"" why not turn around and go to The W if you want fancy. Once again common sense 4. If you are complaining about 9 dollar margaritas why not stay home buy a blender and have your self a good night. Like I stated before I have been coming here for over 10. I have no affiliation with east la what so ever. The food is great thier service is ok, but what can u expect when a place is as busy as it is.

This time I tried a shrimp taco which was just a bunch of tiny frozen shrimp in a hard taco shell with cheese. The shrimp may have been tossed in a garlic butter. Still eh.

The music was insanely loud, as if the 10 o'clock party crowd was ready to rage. If I have to scream to my friends just to talk this early at night, your music is too loud. Nevertheless, we ordered three patron margaritas, one lime margarita, two apps, and three entrees. My meal came out ten minutes later then my companions, due to the waiter rushing past my table without so much as a glance. It was busy, but not so busy where we should have been overlooked. When the bill came, we submitted $75 in gift certificates. When we got the bill, our total was $20 more then it should have been, due to a ""service charge"" added at the end. When we asked the waiter what it was for, he said the appetizers we had ordered, ""guacamole and wings"", were part of the happy hour special so there was an automatic service fee added... When we asked again why that was added since it was not stated on the menu, he had no answer. Additionally, when I reviewed the bill, it said there were four of us instead of three.I'm not sure why this service charge was automatically added to our bill, especially since this was not expressed to us. On their website, it states on their menu 18% gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more.. We were a party of three. I would have tipped 20%, despite the awful service, had I been given the choice.

They also seemed confused because the hostess had asked if someone had been by. Music was much louder tha normal i had to shout at the waiter and also had to ask ""whatt?""

On this visit, I had the Matamoros Enchiladas, which consisted of 3 chicken enchiladas with different sauces--one with suprema sauce (like a cream sauce), one with mole sauce, one with salsa verde. The enchiladas were delicious (but could have been a little hotter, temperature-wise), and the rice and beans were just typical (but tasty enough). If we had half stars on Yelp!, I'd rate the food 3.5 stars.Drinkwise, East LA is spot on-- in fact, the margaritas were just right!! My friend and I ordered a pitcher of frozen swirled margaritas (that's where they swirl two flavors together), and these were extremely tasty. Also, we were both walking a little silly when we left the restaurant--which is always a good sign, right? :) All in all, I had a great experience at this divey little Tex-Mex joint in Hoboken!

The bouncer immediately told me the kitten was closed which seemed like a way to avoid me from coming in. We just wanted drinks so we went in anyway. The hostess said we could not sit and a table and we had to sit at the bar. The only available stools were next to the door and after insisting I did not want to sit next to the door since it was quite cold that day she gave in and said we could sit at a table for 20 minutes. After buying a margarita pitcher (the bartender was very nice which is the inly positive thing i can truly say) the bouncer came and said I needed to take off my hat. I don't know how I wasn't told that upon entry or before I  purchased the pitcher but after removing it I noticed several people continued to wear their hats. I felt as if I was being singled out. We actually stood for about an hour and a half so the hostess was purely bullshitting and I continued for an hour to see people receive plates. I really have a strong dislike for establishments that don't appreciate business. If my female friend didn't insist on saying this place would not have received my business that night.

We got there at 6pm got a table right away even though it was a bit busy. We ordered a large pitcher of coconut margarita, appetizers and 3 dinners. We waited for the pitcher for over 30 minutes which is ridiculous. The margarita was great however no taste of coconut at all. After we got the pitcher took another 20 min for the appetizer. The appetizer that we ordered was missing one dish which they didn't mention  when arrived which we had to advise we missing a dish.  they didn't have anymore therefore have an additional dish. Again the dinner came about 20 min after the appetizers. I have to say the food wasn't as good as I would hoped seemed they lack of salt and pepper. The table next to us who had a baby waiting for their food longer then we had and they were really upset. However other tables seemed to get their food pretty quick.

107,oOHHlMinRHacXvK2NhYB5w,Issac B.,4.0 star rating,"East L.A Mexican restaurant scored well by me for many reasons. First and foremost was the exceptional teamwork this staff had. It was a Tuesday night at 6:30 and though not packed, seemed to be a sence of urgency and rushing around. I don't know if they just finished a rush, but everyone was helping everyone. I stepped in never having been here before. Last Mexican restaurant I tried was Charritto's on the far side of town.Here the hostess was a little distracted applying her make up, so the bartender/maybe manager/maybe owner rushed around the bar to quickly seat me. This gentleman alone was hands on with everything and everybody. Talking to the bar patrons, running to the outside dining area, back to me. I was wiped out from watching him run everywhere.I ordered and suggest anyone that comes here to try their two burritos atrevid dish. It's a dish with one burrito with shredded chicken and one with bean and cheese. It comes with a ""dollop"" of sour cream. It was easily a large ice cream scoop size, and believe me I'm not complaining. They brought out the traditional chip and salsa and this is what can make our break it for me. If it's house made or Pace. It definitely seemed to be house made with fresh chopped cilantro and house baked chips. Not spicy so it's a perfect table salsa and comes in a large enough ramekin to actually get the whole chip in.I enjoyed a Dos Equis which at $6 is a little pricey, but not outrageous. They have frozen Margaritas which are in yogurt dispensing machines, a disappointment to me usually but I understand if it's due to volume of sales. I'll post a copy of the check date 10/13/15The burritos arrived via the hostess and were of fairly good size, so much that I couldn't eat the bean and cheese burrito (which was today's lunch and was fine reheated). Standard side of rice and beans that comes with corn and melted cheese and a simple salad with fresh chopped jalapenos. The Verde sauce was good, not too much that you couldn't taste the burrito. The chicken was shredded, fresh and house prepared. I only know that because I had a small bone that was in it but I associate it with the freshness of ingredients. The decor it's a little weak and worn. The bathroom clean, but due to it facing an alley way it overwhelmingly stunk of cat urine. Again, cannot blame that on the restaurant.They also kept an eye on my table but not harassing me with the standard "" How is everything/ everything taste good?"" Generic question you get at every restaurant. The vibe was relaxed, the food was good and prepared to an excellent taste, they have a small bar and serve a few taps, unlike Charritto's. The only thing, lucky for me as this is a late onset allergy for me, is I forgot to mention I'm allergic to everyone's former favorite super food before kale, the forgotten avocado. They never asked if there were any food allergies, and again, it was my fault in forgetting to mention.Reading other reviews, I dined by myself and saved the receipt. I didn't see any gratuity added on. Like I stated, beer was $6, burritos Atrevid $14 and tax $1.40. Maybe gratuity is included on larger parties, as is common practice for groups of six or more, but that should be clearly stated on the menu and circled on the check. Again, good vibe, good food. But what really, really hit it out of the park for me was the teamwork. That alone could make this establishment prosper.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

112,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,3.0 star rating,"Food: C+We were walking down the street looking for a place to eat when we stumbled across East LA and smelled something good. After we sat down, we received chips and salsa for the table and put in our orders: the steak fajita and the chicken burrito/beef enchilada combo plate. My steak fajita was great - they weren't stingy with the beef, which I thought they might be, and the food was prepared and seasoned well. I really enjoyed it, and still had half of my plate to spare for lunch the next day. The burrito was alright - sort of small, not sure if that's because it's part of the combo plate. It was better with guac and sour cream, which actually came with the fajita, so if they gave that with the burrito too, that'd have been ideal. The enchilada portion of the combo was pretty disappointing though. It seemed like they used some sort of canned beef, or at least that's what it tasted like. It was crumbly and the texture was...bleck. Neither of us enjoyed that one.Service: B-The waiter who served us was super friendly and chatted with us a bit, which was nice, but we were left waiting sometimes, which was strange because there weren't many diners there the night we went (it was mostly people at the bar). He brought out our waters and chips and salsa pretty quickly, but when it came to our check, we were waiting around for a bit. Not sure if it felt like longer because we were outside and it was cold (we chose to sit outside). Other than that, the food came relatively quickly and the service was alright.Ambiance: CNothing fancy. We sat outside by ourselves at one of the simple wooden table with metal chairs - it was cold out, but we chose to do this since we came from the gym and were enjoying the breeze (in the beginning). This place is right on the main street in Hoboken, so there's lots of foot traffic and passersby - a couple of somewhat obnoxious ones that will interrupt your meal with comments, nothing really rude but depends on whether the interruption bothers you - *shrug.* The inside was a little more lively with more people at the bar, drinking their margaritas and having a good time.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

Husband suggested it...which he afterward regretted.  We had to request our table to be cleaned (we had just seated ourselves at an outdoor table that was not cleaned; after asking if we may sit there and being told we could, they didn't notice to clean our dirty table). Well, one star goes to one kind server and the other star to the stiffness of the frozen margarita which otherwise was ok (get the sangria margherita if you insist to get one; don't get the watermelon one which tastes like cotton candy: ie, ineatable).  And this is being generous. The tacos were just eatable: not greasy but not much flavor with unripe avocado and not very fresh corn tortilla. The guac was ok, not terrible, not great: mine is much better and mine is not the best I've had. Nothing about the food except for the flour tortillas is particularly fresh. Mexican food is so much better than this: if I were Mexican, I would be pissed if this restaurant claimed itself to be Mexican.  This is nothing at all like authentic delicious slowly cooked homemade comforting flavorful and fresh Mexican food!

The best part is when the outside of the cup start frosting from the coolness of the drink. So i kind of put this place to the test because I spent some time living on the west coast and had some pretty good mexican food during my time out there.I tried the burritos here before and wasn't too impressed, it was ok.I did like the chicken quesadilla. I asked the waiter add some jalapenos inside the chicken quesadilla which he kindly had the chef make to my requests.Crowd is mixed and fun. I like this place compared to the rest of hoboken, its not too ""FOO HOO"" or too ""ghetto"" as some ppl would say. A decent mixed crowd of after workers, locals, groups of girlfriends etc.The guys and I head over there to watch the playoffs or just grab a drink on thirsty thursdays. For me, its different from the other places in hoboken. Doest look like you walked into a frat party...

It is still pretty packed on weekends. I can't say I have had their food... but I always found it cool to get a frozen margie with a good friend and we usually get the windows in the front. I like crazy quirky places and this one hits the spot. I have had their chips and salsa... the salsa is not homemade... This is the type of place you come and unwind form a cray cray weekend.missing the margies and company.... I wouldn't say this is the place to hang out all day.

The entire thing was a joke. We were about to leave when our order came out. Generally, the staff was pretty unconcerned about having customers. I saw three different employees go out to run errands -- either phone calls, cigarettes, or goods from the convenience store -- all while we sat without complimentary chips and salsa, waters, or silverware. I had to get my own menu -- I should have taken it as a hint.The only thing edible was the chips and salsa -- both of which were pre-made. The side dishes were undercooked, but the tacos were mediocre. Do not get soup here. Just don't. My soup featured very overcooked chicken and a flavorless broth. It was sad.

When the server came over he didn't apologize for our wait or introduce himself. He was actually quite rude and abrupt. It was almost like we were inconveniencing him by wanting to place our order. Lastly, the food. Ugh...so disappointed! Chilli's is better if you are looking for tex-mex food. It's saturated with cheese and there is nothing fresh about it.

But something always leads me back.It was a pretty hot afternoon and I ran into my friend and we instantly thought, frozen margaritas. East LA is known for their frozen alcoholic beverages so we stopped there. Yes, it took us a little while to decide what frozen drink we wanted out of the many many margarita flavors, like peach, mango, blue curacao. But somehow, that little stutter slowed our whole experience down. In order to sit outside, you need to order food. We were not very hungry, mostly just in the mood for our frozen beverages, but we ordered a large guac appetizer to secure our outdoor table. Our drinks took the longest to come out. We were girl chatting and noticed everyone was getting their cool and colorful drinks before we were, and so we asked. We were informed that the bartender was moving slow, but how does that equate the uneven service. On top of waiting forever for our drinks, our chips and guacamole took a long time too. Again we saw food coming out all around us, but not ours. It was a bummer, but the drinks were strong (only needed one) and the guacamole was creamy and authentic.The staff, though initially was kind of stiff, ended up being super nice.

At first he said it was closed, so I look inside and there was about twenty people in there (sus?). Second time we go back and it was only 949 pm ON A THURSDAY and he turned us away again. At this point I had to ask why I couldn't go in and enjoy a margarita, I got no response just a shrug. My cousin went back to Puerto Rico having only been to East LA once,and she liked it,but they turned us away twice ! Now the following month my then pregnant Amiga wanted Mexican food and I wanted a cold drink, so we went (& they let us in!) We ordered dinner, showed up about 40 minutes later,and she was given the wrong meal. I had one margarita,she had mango juice and another person had two margaritas. They had a special for the food which was buy one entree get one free, and still our bill for three people came out to $100 and gratuity was included... For three people you include a 15% tip? And the food wasn't as good as it use to be. Idk, I'm hoping it was just an off summer for me and East LA,because I really do like them.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

There is one bartender that is always doped up or drunk. The food is horriable. The waitstaff can sometimes be testy and unfriendly. There is not many things I really can say about this place but I am sure it has seen better days. Everytime I am there I am always throwed out for some reason on another and that got really old really fast. Your doing youself a big favor of not going there period.

I should've turned around then, but was hungry and decided to continue. What a mistake. After an apathetic waiter greeted us and dropped off the chips (which were the best part of the meal), he turned and loudly yelled to the other staff about his previous evening. My girlfriends chicken quesadilla was akin to plastic and was tasteless. The chicken was fatty and disgusting and the cheese was semi-melted into a coagulated disk of nastiness. I had steak tacos, which were literally pieces of overcooked, shoe leather quasi-meat with some kind of wilted cilantro haphazardly strewn about on top. We both got about 3 bites in (3 too many) before leaving enough cash to cover the tab and sprinting for the door. Calling this place a restaurant is a far fetched exaggeration.

I'm looking past that because of how packed it was).We got seated and it took our waiter 5 minutes to bring us a menu and another 20 to ask what we wanted. We barely were able to give him our drink order. I think he forgot about us a couple times. I don't think it was intentionally, the guy was just swamped with tables. Ironically, they were playing Edm/house music , which I'm a huge fan of, but not what I was expecting when I walk into a place with Mexican flare. The food was good, as usual. Although, quesadillas  does not take a rocket scientist to make. Also, you can sit outside when it's warm out, which I like and always do in the summer.  I'll definitely go back on a night during the week but stay away from this place the before  & the day of Cinco de mayo, plus Friday & Saturdays.

Be sure to get the potatoes. So good.They've got about 15 flavors of margaritas and they come in huge milkshake glasses which are worth the price. I reccomend the melon, strawberry and raspberry margs. I haven't noticed if it's still up but there used to be a sign saying they would only serve you 3 in one sitting and though i've never had a problem getting more, 2-3 is really all you need to get a good buzz/drunk going.Be sure to try the Fat Mexican (a sampler platter including wings, broccoli poppers, quesadillas, and flautas for $15) and get a seat outside for prime people watching.

I'm pretty picky about beans and rice (only like my grandma's and my dad's), but the corn on the rice was a cool twist. The margaritas were yummy, as the reviews stated. I was a little apprehensive before tasting mine because I saw a margarita machine. Usually the margaritas from those things never seem strong enough. But they were definitely strong. It was quite a cold day, so my frozen marg. took awhile to drink (brain freeze). Our ticket for my taco plate, his fajitas, and 4 margaritas was $60.

I've come to the conclusion that they have no idea what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. The best (and safest) thing to order is their tortilla basket (skip the refried beans). That way you can actually eat most of what it brings and have some fresh pico de gallo. It's also a bit pricey for the quantity and quality that you're getting. Not to completely kill off this place (because I actually really love their margaritas), their service sucks. They take way too long to see if you need another drink or your bill.

Back when I was still at school in Hoboken, this was a pretty good happy hour place to visit. $5 frozen margaritas and free chips = quality. But ever since then, they've gotten rid of the happy hour specials, raised the prices on everything, and made the food really really crappy.The only time to even venture in here for food is Tues nights (2 for 1 entrees). Alas, what they give you in quantity, they take away in quality; borderline terrible food, and barely worth it at the discounted price (definitely not worth it at the regular price). I haven't walked by recently, but I think they might have even gotten rid of this special.As a night spot, it's also really not worth it. They have 1 small bar area in the front, and (for whatever reason) people pack in here like lemmings (for a similar situation, see Green Rock). They claim to have a late night happy hour special ($5.25 frozen margaritas). I've been a few times late night and they did not honor this price; other times, they did.

That should have been a sign to leave but we were hungry so we stayed. Big mistake.The restaurant must think that it's a bad club, starting at around 7 pm. The terrible music was so loud that we had to shout to hear eachother over the thumpa-thumpa club music circa 2002. Our frozen margaritas were poorly mixed and you could taste the tequila and strawberry syrup. They got the job done but were a bit painful to drink. Other than the decent chips and salsa, the food was bland and boring. The guacamole was a decent sized portion but did not taste fresh at all. I ordered the combo meal of a bean and cheese burrito and guacamole tostada. I had to cover my food in salsa to spice it up. The portions were big but the taste was small.  The service was awful - we had no idea who our waiter was as the one who came to our table first disappeared and throughout the night we flagged different people to accomplish the very difficult tasks of bringing and refilling our water and taking our order.

It was too cheesy and $8 for 4 pieces was a lil more than i expected. The nachos and salsa they serve in the beginning for free is pretty good.,East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"
281,isGcOAdl7ymGJZDNBwWntA,Daniel R.,1.0 star rating,This place is awesome if you love eating Mexican food while observing roaches crawl around. If roaches aren't your thing you should go for the fruit flies which will accompany you while you eat and drink your food. I will never be eating here again. The little bit of food I did eat before losing my appetite was sub-par. The margaritas were good but not enough to make up for everything else...I can't believe people have given this place more than 2 stars...,East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

The host comes by to pre-bus the table and I told him we havent eaten yet.  He says ""you got to be joking with me that you havent eaten yet?""  Didnt see him after that for a while.When we ask the server she walks up to the passbar and starts up with the cooks... I tell the host can you send a manager to the table please?  He walks away and the manager never comes.  One plate out of the three comes out (1 hour after ordering).  Then finally the other two arrive.  I asked the server ""what was the problem?  Did the check not print in your kitchen?  She replies with ""I am sorry its not my fault - We are trying to work together""   ---- ACTUALLY it is your fault!  If you took any time out and talked to our table you wouldve found out everyone sitting there is in the restaurant industry and we all have heavy expierence in high volume restaurants unlike this craphole establishment you are working at.  We all understand the business and tried to be patient as possible but since it was so loud in there we couldnt hear each other talking the whole situation became more irritating.The food was taco bell quality - AWFUL!Chicken was stringy, corn was cold, cheese wasn't melted.  At the end of my meal I saw the host pass by and I asked him for the bill and a togo box since the waitress didnt care to ask.  The waitress came by and tells me ""I took the drinks off""  Then when I look at the bill a open gratuity charge of 18% !!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable.  East LA - Learn something - SERVICE, FOOD QUALITY AND CLEANLINESS are very important in the hospitality business - East LA is poor in all aspects.Hoboken residents go down the block to Qdoba you will get better food there! At least there if you ask for a manager they will show there face once",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

The location is awesome, I love sitting in the cramped outdoor section to people-watch on Washington Street. The interior is just so-so. I've had all sorts of stuff from the menu, and prefer the appetizers to any of the entrees. The nachos are especially great. I love the fresh chips and salsa as well.

It might not be authentic mex food (hoboken doesn't really have many good places to eat), but at least they did decently. I would give them another star but my experience was ruined by loud hip-hop music and dimmed lights at 7pm.. maybe its because it was a Friday night. The service was ok but I wouldn't blame them, it was such a busy night all the waitstaff were running around like headless chickens but they stil managed to crack a smile and be friendly.

The gossips couldn't wait to tell me, after I moved in, that I occupied the owner's mother's old apartment...which she ""earned"" by having an affair with the mayor.  Apparently, she did pretty well as his mistress because he put the building in her name, as well as a few others, like the one East L.A. occupies on the ground floor.  I'm glad I didn't grow up in such a small town with petty people who couldn't wait to see me fail.  It is shocking sometimes how unbelieveably cruel and callous people can be.  Anyway, small town drama aside, it was the food that was a joke to me.  I was raised on Mexican food as a child, and this food didn't resemble anything close to Mexican food, aside from the names on the menu.  It was horribly disappointing.  The salsa tasted like marinara and the rice and beans...yuk!  I have a suggestion for the manager...HIRE A MEXICAN COOK OR TWO...not someone from Puerto Rico or Santo Domingo.  And your grandmother's marinara recipe does NOT work for salsa...try some clinatro...lime... tomatillos...or just skip the food altogether and focus solely on what you're really there to sell...alcohol.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"

The staff was really nice, but service could be a little slow.  I got a chicken taco salad, and it was alright.  The chicken didn't have a great taste, but the dressing was good and the veggies were all fresh.  My friends all got a few different things, and everyone was happy with their food.  It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but it's a nice, fun place to eat in Hoboken.",East LA,3.0 star rating,$$,"Mexican,, Bars"
