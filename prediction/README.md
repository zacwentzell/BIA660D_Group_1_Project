# Prediction Folder 

**Contributers**: Alec Kulakowski


Folder and File Info 
--------------------

### Files (in order)

**README.md**: This file! Information related to the folder and its files. 

**bagofwords.py**: Script to predict Yelp star ratings based on review text, 
using the bag-of-words technique. 

**bagofwords.csv**: Output created by *bagofwords.py*

**bagofwords.ipynb**: iPython Notebook demonstrating the steps and results of 
*bagofwords.py*.

**features.py**: Additional EDA and feature creation/selection. The EDA and 
feature manipulation files throughout this project have been broken up into
multiple files and saved multiple times as CSVs because the running time for 
each tends to be quite long so multiple files and CSVs allow for checkpoints
to save progress. This is useful in the event of a crash or similar situation. 

**features.ipynb**: Graphical representation of *features.py*, useful for 
visualizing any sort of relationship or correlation (not necessarily 
linear) between potential features/predictive variables and the output.

Details
--------------------
*bagofwords* files (.py, .csv, .ipynb) include preliminary modeling as well as
some minor additional EDA (not all in the EDA folder).
