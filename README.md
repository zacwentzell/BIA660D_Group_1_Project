Project Narative 
-------
We sourced the bulk of our dataset (used for training/test/cross-validation) from the 
[Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The remaining data we 
manually scraped from a targeted Yelp search. We focused on Hoboken data, 
and scraped every review for every restaurant in Hoboken, NJ (this was
to be our validation dataset, to judge our model's overall accuracy on).
